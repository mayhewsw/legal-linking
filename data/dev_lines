Imprisoned by the State of Colorado and alleging violations of his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment , William Erickson , the petitioner in this Court , filed suit against prison officials in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado . He alleged that a liver condition resulting from hepatitis C required a treatment program that officials had commenced but then wrongfully terminated , with life - threatening consequences . Deeming these allegations , and others to be noted , to be conclusory, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the District Courts dismissal of petitioners complaint . 198Fed .

Imprisoned by the State of Colorado and alleging violations of his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment , William Erickson , the petitioner in this Court , filed suit against prison officials in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado . He alleged that a liver condition resulting from hepatitis C required a treatment program that officials had commenced but then wrongfully terminated , with life - threatening consequences . Deeming these allegations , and others to be noted , to be conclusory, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the District Courts dismissal of petitioners complaint . 198Fed .

The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President .

The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

Consistent with these views , I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals . I respectfully dissent .	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0

All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills .

2 . Congress , justifiably concerned with evidence that deportable criminal aliens who are not detained continue to engage in crime and fail to appear for their removal hearings in large numbers , may require that persons such as respondent be detained for the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings . In the exercise of its broad power over naturalization and immigration , Congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens . Mathews v. Diaz , 426 U. S. 67 . Although the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process in deportation proceedings , Reno v. Flores , 507 U. S. 292 , detention during such proceedings is a constitutionally valid aspect of the process , e.g. , Wong Wing v. United States , 163 U. S. 228 , even where , as here , aliens challenge their detention on the grounds that there has been no finding that they are unlikely to appear for their deportation proceedings , Carlson v. Landon , 342 U. S. 524 . The INS detention of respondent , a criminal alien who has conceded that he is deportable , for the limited period of his removal proceedings , is governed by these cases . Respondent argues unpersuasively that the § 1226(c ) detention policy violates due process under Zadvydas , 533 U. S. , at 699 , in which the Court held that § 1231(a)(b ) authorizes continued detention of an alien subject to a final removal order beyond that sections 90-day removal period for only such time as is reasonably necessary to secure the removal . Zadvydas is materially different from the present case in two respects . First , the aliens there challenging their detention following final deportation orders were ones for whom removal was no longer practically attainable, such that their detention did not serve its purported immigration purpose . Id. , at 690 . In contrast , because the statutory provision at issue in this case governs detention of deportable criminal aliens pending their removal proceedings , the detention necessarily serves the purpose of preventing the aliens from fleeing prior to or during such proceedings . Second , while the period of detention at issue in Zadvydas was indefinite and potentially permanent, i d . , at 690691 , the record shows that 1226(c ) detention not only has a definite termination point , but lasts , in the majority of cases , for less than the 90 days the Court considered presumptively valid in Zadvydas . Pp . 620 .	No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia , when in actual service in time of war or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation .	1

In his habeas corpus challenge , respondent did not contest Congress general authority to remove criminal aliens from the United States . Nor did he argue that he himself was not deportable within the meaning of § 1226(c ) . 6 Rather , respondent argued that the Government may not , consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment , detain him for the brief period necessary for his removal proceedings . The dissent , after an initial detour on the issue of respondents concession , see post , at 24 ( opinion of Souter , J. ) , ultimately acknowledges the real issue in this case .

If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law . But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays , and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively . If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall have been presented to him , the same shall be a law , in like manner as if he had signed it , unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return , in which case it shall not be a law .

Official conduct that does not compromise any legitimate interest in privacy is not a search subject to the Fourth Amendment . Jacobsen , 466 U. S. , at 123 . We have held that any interest in possessing contraband can not be deemed legitimate, and thus , governmental conduct that only reveals the possession of contraband compromises no legitimate privacy interest. Ibid . This is because the expectation that certain facts will not come to the attention of the authorities is not the same as an interest in privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable. Id. , at 122 ( punctuation omitted ) . In United States v. Place , 462 U.

Respondent likewise concedes that drug sniffs are designed , and if properly conducted are generally likely , to reveal only the presence of contraband. Brief for Respondent 17 . Although respondent argues that the error rates , particularly the existence of false positives , call into question the premise that drug - detection dogs alert only to contraband , the record contains no evidence or findings that support his argument . Moreover , respondent does not suggest that an erroneous alert , in and of itself , reveals any legitimate private information , and , in this case , the trial judge found that the dog sniff was sufficiently reliable to establish probable cause to conduct a full - blown search of the trunk .

The legitimate expectation that information about perfectly lawful activity will remain private is categorically distinguishable from respondents hopes or expectations concerning the nondetection of contraband in the trunk of his car . A dog sniff conducted during a concededly lawful traffic stop that reveals no information other than the location of a substance that no individual has any right to possess does not violate the Fourth Amendment .

The question on which we granted certiorari , 541 U.

Here , the initial seizure of respondent when he was stopped on the highway was based on probable cause , and was concededly lawful . It is nevertheless clear that a seizure that is lawful at its inception can violate the Fourth Amendment if its manner of execution unreasonably infringes interests protected by the Constitution . United States v. Jacobsen , 466 U. S. 109 , 124 ( 1984 ) . A seizure that is justified solely by the interest in issuing a warning ticket to the driver can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete that mission . In an earlier case involving a dog sniff that occurred during an unreasonably prolonged traffic stop , the Illinois Supreme Court held that use of the dog and the subsequent discovery of contraband were the product of an unconstitutional seizure . People v. Cox , 202 Ill. 2d 462 , 782 N. E. 2d 275 ( 2002 ) . We may assume that a similar result would be warranted in this case if the dog sniff had been conducted while respondent was being unlawfully detained .

Here , the initial seizure of respondent when he was stopped on the highway was based on probable cause , and was concededly lawful . It is nevertheless clear that a seizure that is lawful at its inception can violate the Fourth Amendment if its manner of execution unreasonably infringes interests protected by the Constitution . United States v. Jacobsen , 466 U. S. 109 , 124 ( 1984 ) . A seizure that is justified solely by the interest in issuing a warning ticket to the driver can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete that mission . In an earlier case involving a dog sniff that occurred during an unreasonably prolonged traffic stop , the Illinois Supreme Court held that use of the dog and the subsequent discovery of contraband were the product of an unconstitutional seizure . People v. Cox , 202 Ill. 2d 462 , 782 N. E. 2d 275 ( 2002 ) .

Thus , we proceed on the assumption that the officer conducting the dog sniff had no information about respondent except that he had been stopped for speeding ; accordingly , we have omitted any reference to facts about respondent that might have triggered a modicum of suspicion .	No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice , and no person who has held the office of President , or acted as President , for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once . But this article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this article was proposed by the Congress , and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President , or acting as President , during the term within which this article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term . This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three - fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states by the Congress .	0

Thus , we proceed on the assumption that the officer conducting the dog sniff had no information about respondent except that he had been stopped for speeding ; accordingly , we have omitted any reference to facts about respondent that might have triggered a modicum of suspicion .	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

The question on which we granted certiorari , 541 U. S. 972 ( 2004 ) , is narrow : Whether the Fourth Amendment requires reasonable , articulable suspicion to justify using a drug - detection dog to sniff a vehicle during a legitimate traffic stop. Pet . for Cert . i. Thus , we proceed on the assumption that the officer conducting the dog sniff had no information about respondent except that he had been stopped for speeding ; accordingly , we have omitted any reference to facts about respondent that might have triggered a modicum of suspicion .	No state shall enter into any treaty , alliance , or confederation ; grant letters of marque and reprisal ; coin money ; emit bills of credit ; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts ; pass any bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or law impairing the obligation of contracts , or grant any title of nobility . No state shall , without the consent of the Congress , lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports , except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it 's inspection laws : and the net produce of all duties and imposts , laid by any state on imports or exports , shall be for the use of the treasury of the United States ; and all such laws shall be subject to the revision and control of the Congress . No state shall , without the consent of Congress , lay any duty of tonnage , keep troops , or ships of war in time of peace , enter into any agreement or compact with another state , or with a foreign power , or engage in war , unless actually invaded , or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay .	0
Here , the initial seizure of respondent when he was stopped on the highway was based on probable cause , and was concededly lawful . It is nevertheless clear that a seizure that is lawful at its inception can violate the Fourth Amendment if its manner of execution unreasonably infringes interests protected by the Constitution . United States v. Jacobsen , 466 U. S. 109 , 124 ( 1984 ) . A seizure that is justified solely by the interest in issuing a warning ticket to the driver can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete that mission . In an earlier case involving a dog sniff that occurred during an unreasonably prolonged traffic stop , the Illinois Supreme Court held that use of the dog and the subsequent discovery of contraband were the product of an unconstitutional seizure . People v. Cox , 202 Ill. 2d 462 , 782 N. E. 2d 275 ( 2002 ) . We may assume that a similar result would be warranted in this case if the dog sniff had been conducted while respondent was being unlawfully detained .	All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives . The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states , and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature . No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty five years , and been seven years a citizen of the United States , and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen . Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union , according to their respective numbers , which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons , including those bound to service for a term of years , and excluding Indians not taxed , three fifths of all other Persons . The actual Enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States , and within every subsequent term of ten years , in such manner as they shall by law direct . The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand , but each state shall have at least one Representative ; and until such enumeration shall be made , the state of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three , Massachusetts eight , Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one , Connecticut five , New York six , New Jersey four , Pennsylvania eight , Delaware one , Maryland six , Virginia ten , North Carolina five , South Carolina five , and Georgia three . When vacancies happen in the Representation from any state , the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies . The House of Representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers ; and shall have the sole power of impeachment . The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state , chosen by the legislature thereof , for six years ; and each Senator shall have one vote . Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election , they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes . The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen by resignation , or otherwise , during the recess of the legislature of any state , the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature , which shall then fill such vacancies . No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years , and been nine years a citizen of the United States and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen . The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate , but shall have no vote , unless they be equally divided . The Senate shall choose their other officers , and also a President pro tempore , in the absence of the Vice President , or when he shall exercise the office of President of the United States . The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments . When sitting for that purpose , they shall be on oath or affirmation . When the President of the United States is tried , the Chief Justice shall preside : And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present . Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office , and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor , trust or profit under the United States : but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment , trial , judgment and punishment , according to law . The times , places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives , shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof ; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations , except as to the places of choosing Senators . The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year , and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December , unless they shall by law appoint a different day . Each House shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members , and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business ; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day , and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members , in such manner , and under such penalties as each House may provide . Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings , punish its members for disorderly behavior , and , with the concurrence of two thirds , expel a member . Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings , and from time to time publish the same , excepting such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy ; and the yeas and nays of the members of either House on any question shall , at the desire of one fifth of those present , be entered on the journal . Neither House , during the session of Congress , shall , without the consent of the other , adjourn for more than three days , nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting . The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services , to be ascertained by law , and paid out of the treasury of the United States . They shall in all cases , except treason , felony and breach of the peace , be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same ; and for any speech or debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other place . No Senator or Representative shall , during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time : and no person holding any office under the United States , shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office . All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it become a law , be presented to the President of the United States ; if he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it . If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law . But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays , and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively . If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall have been presented to him , the same shall be a law , in like manner as if he had signed it , unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return , in which case it shall not be a law . Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill . The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises , to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States ; but all duties , imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States ; To borrow money on the credit of the United States ; To regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several states , and with the Indian tribes ; To establish a uniform rule of naturalization , and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States ; To coin money , regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin , and fix the standard of weights and measures ; To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States ; To establish post offices and post roads ; To promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries ; To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court ; To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas , and offenses against the law of nations ; To declare war , grant letters of marque and reprisal , and make rules concerning captures on land and water ; To raise and support armies , but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years ; To provide and maintain a navy ; To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces ; To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union , suppress insurrections and repel invasions ; To provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining , the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , reserving to the states respectively , the appointment of the officers , and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress ; To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten miles square ) as may , by cession of particular states , and the acceptance of Congress , become the seat of the government of the United States , and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be , for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , dockyards , and other needful buildings ;-- And To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof . The migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit , shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight , but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation , not exceeding ten dollars for each person . The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended , unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it . No bill of attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed .

No preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one state over those of another : nor shall vessels bound to , or from , one state , be obliged to enter , clear or pay duties in another . No money shall be drawn from the treasury , but in consequence of appropriations made by law ; and a regular statement and account of receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time . No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States : and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them , shall , without the consent of the Congress , accept of any present , emolument , office , or title , of any kind whatever , from any king , prince , or foreign state .

We may assume that a similar result would be warranted in this case if the dog sniff had been conducted while respondent was being unlawfully detained .	The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government , and shall protect each of them against invasion ; and on application of the legislature , or of the executive ( when the legislature can not be convened ) against domestic violence .	0
Official conduct that does not compromise any legitimate interest in privacy is not a search subject to the Fourth Amendment . Jacobsen , 466 U. S. , at 123 . We have held that any interest in possessing contraband can not be deemed legitimate, and thus , governmental conduct that only reveals the possession of contraband compromises no legitimate privacy interest. Ibid . This is because the expectation that certain facts will not come to the attention of the authorities is not the same as an interest in privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable. Id. , at 122 ( punctuation omitted ) . In United States v. Place , 462 U. S. 696 ( 1983 ) , we treated a canine sniff by a well - trained narcotics - detection dog as " sui generis " because it " discloses only the presence or absence of narcotics , a contraband item . " Id. , at 707 ; see also Indianapolis v. Edmond , 531 U. S. 32 , 40 ( 2000 ) . Respondent likewise concedes that drug sniffs are designed , and if properly conducted are generally likely , to reveal only the presence of contraband. Brief for Respondent 17 . Although respondent argues that the error rates , particularly the existence of false positives , call into question the premise that drug - detection dogs alert only to contraband , the record contains no evidence or findings that support his argument . Moreover , respondent does not suggest that an erroneous alert , in and of itself , reveals any legitimate private information , and , in this case , the trial judge found that the dog sniff was sufficiently reliable to establish probable cause to conduct a full - blown search of the trunk .	No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice , and no person who has held the office of President , or acted as President , for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once . But this article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this article was proposed by the Congress , and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President , or acting as President , during the term within which this article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term . This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three - fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states by the Congress .	0

Official conduct that does not compromise any legitimate interest in privacy is not a search subject to the Fourth Amendment . Jacobsen , 466 U. S. , at 123 . We have held that any interest in possessing contraband can not be deemed legitimate, and thus , governmental conduct that only reveals the possession of contraband compromises no legitimate privacy interest. Ibid . This is because the expectation that certain facts will not come to the attention of the authorities is not the same as an interest in privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable. Id. , at 122 ( punctuation omitted ) . In United States v. Place , 462 U. S. 696 ( 1983 ) , we treated a canine sniff by a well - trained narcotics - detection dog as " sui generis " because it " discloses only the presence or absence of narcotics , a contraband item . " Id. , at 707 ; see also Indianapolis v. Edmond , 531 U. S. 32 , 40 ( 2000 ) . Respondent likewise concedes that drug sniffs are designed , and if properly conducted are generally likely , to reveal only the presence of contraband. Brief for Respondent 17 . Although respondent argues that the error rates , particularly the existence of false positives , call into question the premise that drug - detection dogs alert only to contraband , the record contains no evidence or findings that support his argument . Moreover , respondent does not suggest that an erroneous alert , in and of itself , reveals any legitimate private information , and , in this case , the trial judge found that the dog sniff was sufficiently reliable to establish probable cause to conduct a full - blown search of the trunk .

In all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , and those in which a state shall be party , the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction . In all the other cases before mentioned , the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction , both as to law and fact , with such exceptions , and under such regulations as the Congress shall make .

This conclusion is entirely consistent with our recent decision that the use of a thermal - imaging device to detect the growth of marijuana in a home constituted an unlawful search . Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . Critical to that decision was the fact that the device was capable of detecting lawful activityin that case , intimate details in a home , such as at what hour each night the lady of the house takes her daily sauna and bath. I d . , at 38 . The legitimate expectation that information about perfectly lawful activity will remain private is categorically distinguishable from respondents hopes or expectations concerning the nondetection of contraband in the trunk of his car . A dog sniff conducted during a concededly lawful traffic stop that reveals no information other than the location of a substance that no individual has any right to possess does not violate the Fourth Amendment .	The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states . A person charged in any state with treason , felony , or other crime , who shall flee from justice , and be found in another state , shall on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled , be delivered up , to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime .

In United States v. Place , 462 U. S. 696 ( 1983 ) , we categorized the sniff of the narcotics - seeking dog as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment and held it was not a search . Id. , at 707 .

Once the dogs fallibility is recognized , however , that ends the justification claimed in Place for treating the sniff as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment : the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband , and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime . This is not , of course , to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion , or probable cause , to search the container or enclosure ; the Fourth Amendment does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband . The point is simply that the sniff and alert can not claim the certainty that Place assumed , both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as sui generis and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny . And when that aura of uniqueness disappears , there is no basis in Place s reasoning , and no good reason otherwise , to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform . They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive , even when conventionally enhanced . The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations , but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort , which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched . Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures , to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area . And given the fallibility of the dog , the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband , just as a thermal - imaging device might do , as described in Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . 3	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	1

The point is simply that the sniff and alert can not claim the certainty that Place assumed , both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as sui generis and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny . And when that aura of uniqueness disappears , there is no basis in Place s reasoning , and no good reason otherwise , to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform . They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive , even when conventionally enhanced . The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations , but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort , which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched . Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures , to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area . And given the fallibility of the dog , the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband , just as a thermal - imaging device might do , as described in Kyllo v. United States , 533 U.

It makes sense , then , to treat a sniff as the search that it amounts to in practice , and to rely on the body of our Fourth Amendment cases , including Kyllo , in deciding whether such a search is reasonable . As a general proposition , using a dog to sniff for drugs is subject to the rule that the object of enforcing criminal laws does not , without more , justify suspicionless Fourth Amendment intrusions .

See Brief for Respondent 31 . There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest , however , see Knowles v. Iowa , 525 U. S. 113 ( 1998 ) , for the police did nothing more than detain Caballes long enough to check his record and write a ticket . As a consequence , the reasonableness of the search must be assessed in relation to the actual delay the police chose to impose , and as Justice Ginsburg points out in her opinion , post , at 34 , the Fourth Amendment consequences of stopping for a traffic citation are settled law .

As a general proposition , using a dog to sniff for drugs is subject to the rule that the object of enforcing criminal laws does not , without more , justify suspicionless Fourth Amendment intrusions . See Indianapolis v. Edmond , 531 U. S. 32 , 4142 ( 2000 ) . Since the police claim to have had no particular suspicion that Caballes was violating any drug law , 4 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it . It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence , which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest . See Brief for Respondent 31 . There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest , however , see Knowles v. Iowa , 525 U. S. 113 ( 1998 ) , for the police did nothing more than detain Caballes long enough to check his record and write a ticket . As a consequence , the reasonableness of the search must be assessed in relation to the actual delay the police chose to impose , and as Justice Ginsburg points out in her opinion , post , at 34 , the Fourth Amendment consequences of stopping for a traffic citation are settled law .	All debts contracted and engagements entered into , before the adoption of this Constitution , shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution , as under the Confederation .

In Berkemer v. McCarty , 468 U. S. 420 , 439440 ( 1984 ) , followed in Knowles , supra , at 488 , we held that the analogue of the common traffic stop was the limited detention for investigation authorized by Terry v. Ohio , 392 U. S. 1 ( 1968 ) . While Terry authorized a restricted incidental search for weapons when reasonable suspicion warrants such a safety measure , i d . , at 2526 , the Court took care to keep a Terry stop from automatically becoming a foot in the door for all investigatory purposes ; the permissible intrusion was bounded by the justification for the detention , i d . , at 2930 . 5 Although facts disclosed by enquiry within this limit might give grounds to go further , the government could not otherwise take advantage of a suspects immobility to search for evidence unrelated to the reason for the detention . That has to be the rule unless Terry is going to become an open - sesame for general searches , and that rule requires holding that the police do not have reasonable grounds to conduct sniff searches for drugs simply because they have stopped someone to receive a ticket for a highway offense . Since the police had no indication of illegal activity beyond the speed of the car in this case , the sniff search should be held unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and its fruits should be suppressed .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	1

Nothing in the case relied upon by the Court , United States v. Jacobsen , 466 U. S. 109 ( 1984 ) , unsettled the limit of reasonable enquiry adopted in Terry . In Jacobsen , the Court found that no Fourth Amendment search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained . The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine , the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake . 466 U. S. , at 123 . As already explained , however , the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate Fourth Amendment protection .

The Court today does not go so far as to say explicitly that sniff searches by dogs trained to sense contraband always get a free pass under the Fourth Amendment , since it reserves judgment on the constitutional significance of sniffs assumed to be more intrusive than a dogs walk around a stopped car , ante , at 4 .

But the Courts stated reasoning provides no apparent stopping point short of such excesses .

The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President .

He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .

No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty five years , and been seven years a citizen of the United States , and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen . Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union , according to their respective numbers , which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons , including those bound to service for a term of years , and excluding Indians not taxed , three fifths of all other Persons . The actual Enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States , and within every subsequent term of ten years , in such manner as they shall by law direct . The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand , but each state shall have at least one Representative ; and until such enumeration shall be made , the state of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three , Massachusetts eight , Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one , Connecticut five , New York six , New Jersey four , Pennsylvania eight , Delaware one , Maryland six , Virginia ten , North Carolina five , South Carolina five , and Georgia three .

The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state , chosen by the legislature thereof , for six years ; and each Senator shall have one vote . Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election , they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes . The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen by resignation , or otherwise , during the recess of the legislature of any state , the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature , which shall then fill such vacancies . No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years , and been nine years a citizen of the United States and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen . The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate , but shall have no vote , unless they be equally divided . The Senate shall choose their other officers , and also a President pro tempore , in the absence of the Vice President , or when he shall exercise the office of President of the United States . The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments . When sitting for that purpose , they shall be on oath or affirmation . When the President of the United States is tried , the Chief Justice shall preside : And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present .

The times , places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives , shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof ; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations , except as to the places of choosing Senators . The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year , and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December , unless they shall by law appoint a different day . Each House shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members , and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business ; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day , and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members , in such manner , and under such penalties as each House may provide . Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings , punish its members for disorderly behavior , and , with the concurrence of two thirds , expel a member . Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings , and from time to time publish the same , excepting such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy ; and the yeas and nays of the members of either House on any question shall , at the desire of one fifth of those present , be entered on the journal . Neither House , during the session of Congress , shall , without the consent of the other , adjourn for more than three days , nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting . The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services , to be ascertained by law , and paid out of the treasury of the United States . They shall in all cases , except treason , felony and breach of the peace , be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same ; and for any speech or debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other place . No Senator or Representative shall , during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time : and no person holding any office under the United States , shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office . All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it become a law , be presented to the President of the United States ; if he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it . If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law . But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays , and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively . If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall have been presented to him , the same shall be a law , in like manner as if he had signed it , unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return , in which case it shall not be a law . Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill .

No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States : and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them , shall , without the consent of the Congress , accept of any present , emolument , office , or title , of any kind whatever , from any king , prince , or foreign state . No state shall enter into any treaty , alliance , or confederation ; grant letters of marque and reprisal ; coin money ; emit bills of credit ; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts ; pass any bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or law impairing the obligation of contracts , or grant any title of nobility .

The Court today does not go so far as to say explicitly that sniff searches by dogs trained to sense contraband always get a free pass under the Fourth Amendment , since it reserves judgment on the constitutional significance of sniffs assumed to be more intrusive than a dogs walk around a stopped car , ante , at 4 . For this reason , I do not take the Courts reliance on Jacobsen as actually signaling recognition of a broad authority to conduct suspicionless sniffs for drugs in any parked car , about which Justice Ginsburg is rightly concerned , post , at 56 , or on the person of any pedestrian minding his own business on a sidewalk . But the Courts stated reasoning provides no apparent stopping point short of such excesses . For the sake of providing a workable framework to analyze cases on facts like these , which are certain to come along , I would treat the dog sniff as the familiar search it is in fact , subject to scrutiny under the Fourth Amendment . 7	The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0
In United States v. Place , 462 U. S. 696 ( 1983 ) , we categorized the sniff of the narcotics - seeking dog as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment and held it was not a search . Id. , at 707 . The classification rests not only upon the limited nature of the intrusion , but on a further premise that experience has shown to be untenable , the assumption that trained sniffing dogs do not err . What we have learned about the fallibility of dogs in the years since Place was decided would itself be reason to call for reconsidering Place s decision against treating the intentional use of a trained dog as a search . The portent of this very case , however , adds insistence to the call , for an uncritical adherence to Place would render the Fourth Amendment indifferent to suspicionless and indiscriminate sweeps of cars in parking garages and pedestrians on sidewalks ; if a sniff is not preceded by a seizure subject to Fourth Amendment notice , it escapes Fourth Amendment review entirely unless it is treated as a search . We should not wait for these developments to occur before rethinking Place s analysis , which invites such untoward consequences . 1	The judicial power of the United States , shall be vested in one Supreme Court , and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish .

Once the dogs fallibility is recognized , however , that ends the justification claimed in Place for treating the sniff as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment : the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband , and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime . This is not , of course , to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion , or probable cause , to search the container or enclosure ; the Fourth Amendment does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband . The point is simply that the sniff and alert can not claim the certainty that Place assumed , both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as sui generis and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny . And when that aura of uniqueness disappears , there is no basis in Place s reasoning , and no good reason otherwise , to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform . They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive , even when conventionally enhanced . The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations , but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort , which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched . Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures , to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area . And given the fallibility of the dog , the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband , just as a thermal - imaging device might do , as described in Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . 3	The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people .	0

Once the dogs fallibility is recognized , however , that ends the justification claimed in Place for treating the sniff as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment : the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband , and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime . This is not , of course , to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion , or probable cause , to search the container or enclosure ; the Fourth Amendment does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband . The point is simply that the sniff and alert can not claim the certainty that Place assumed , both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as sui generis and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny . And when that aura of uniqueness disappears , there is no basis in Place s reasoning , and no good reason otherwise , to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform . They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive , even when conventionally enhanced . The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations , but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort , which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched . Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures , to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area . And given the fallibility of the dog , the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband , just as a thermal - imaging device might do , as described in Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . 3	Each House shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members , and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business ; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day , and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members , in such manner , and under such penalties as each House may provide .

In Berkemer v. McCarty , 468 U.

The Court today does not go so far as to say explicitly that sniff searches by dogs trained to sense contraband always get a free pass under the Fourth Amendment , since it reserves judgment on the constitutional significance of sniffs assumed to be more intrusive than a dogs walk around a stopped car , ante , at 4 . For this reason , I do not take the Courts reliance on Jacobsen as actually signaling recognition of a broad authority to conduct suspicionless sniffs for drugs in any parked car , about which Justice Ginsburg is rightly concerned , post , at 56 , or on the person of any pedestrian minding his own business on a sidewalk . But the Courts stated reasoning provides no apparent stopping point short of such excesses .

The Court today does not go so far as to say explicitly that sniff searches by dogs trained to sense contraband always get a free pass under the Fourth Amendment , since it reserves judgment on the constitutional significance of sniffs assumed to be more intrusive than a dogs walk around a stopped car , ante , at 4 . For this reason , I do not take the Courts reliance on Jacobsen as actually signaling recognition of a broad authority to conduct suspicionless sniffs for drugs in any parked car , about which Justice Ginsburg is rightly concerned , post , at 56 , or on the person of any pedestrian minding his own business on a sidewalk . But the Courts stated reasoning provides no apparent stopping point short of such excesses . For the sake of providing a workable framework to analyze cases on facts like these , which are certain to come along , I would treat the dog sniff as the familiar search it is in fact , subject to scrutiny under the Fourth Amendment . 7	The right of citizens of the United States , who are 18 years of age or older , to vote , shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of age .

In United States v. Place , 462 U. S. 696 ( 1983 ) , we categorized the sniff of the narcotics - seeking dog as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment and held it was not a search . Id. , at 707 . The classification rests not only upon the limited nature of the intrusion , but on a further premise that experience has shown to be untenable , the assumption that trained sniffing dogs do not err . What we have learned about the fallibility of dogs in the years since Place was decided would itself be reason to call for reconsidering Place s decision against treating the intentional use of a trained dog as a search . The portent of this very case , however , adds insistence to the call , for an uncritical adherence to Place would render the Fourth Amendment indifferent to suspicionless and indiscriminate sweeps of cars in parking garages and pedestrians on sidewalks ; if a sniff is not preceded by a seizure subject to Fourth Amendment notice , it escapes Fourth Amendment review entirely unless it is treated as a search .

Once the dogs fallibility is recognized , however , that ends the justification claimed in Place for treating the sniff as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment : the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband , and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime . This is not , of course , to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion , or probable cause , to search the container or enclosure ; the Fourth Amendment does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband . The point is simply that the sniff and alert can not claim the certainty that Place assumed , both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as sui generis and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny . And when that aura of uniqueness disappears , there is no basis in Place s reasoning , and no good reason otherwise , to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform . They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive , even when conventionally enhanced . The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations , but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort , which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched . Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures , to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area . And given the fallibility of the dog , the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband , just as a thermal - imaging device might do , as described in Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . 3	The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government , and shall protect each of them against invasion ; and on application of the legislature , or of the executive ( when the legislature can not be convened ) against domestic violence .	0

This is not , of course , to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion , or probable cause , to search the container or enclosure ; the Fourth Amendment does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband . The point is simply that the sniff and alert can not claim the certainty that Place assumed , both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as sui generis and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny . And when that aura of uniqueness disappears , there is no basis in Place s reasoning , and no good reason otherwise , to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform . They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive , even when conventionally enhanced . The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations , but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort , which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched . Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures , to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area . And given the fallibility of the dog , the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband , just as a thermal - imaging device might do , as described in Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . 3	The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session .	0

United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . 3	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

It makes sense , then , to treat a sniff as the search that it amounts to in practice , and to rely on the body of our Fourth Amendment cases , including Kyllo , in deciding whether such a search is reasonable . As a general proposition , using a dog to sniff for drugs is subject to the rule that the object of enforcing criminal laws does not , without more , justify suspicionless Fourth Amendment intrusions . See Indianapolis v. Edmond , 531 U. S. 32 , 4142 ( 2000 ) . Since the police claim to have had no particular suspicion that Caballes was violating any drug law , 4 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it . It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence , which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest . See Brief for Respondent 31 . There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest , however , see Knowles v. Iowa , 525 U. S. 113 ( 1998 ) , for the police did nothing more than detain Caballes long enough to check his record and write a ticket . As a consequence , the reasonableness of the search must be assessed in relation to the actual delay the police chose to impose , and as Justice Ginsburg points out in her opinion , post , at 34 , the Fourth Amendment consequences of stopping for a traffic citation are settled law .	The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state , chosen by the legislature thereof , for six years ; and each Senator shall have one vote . Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election , they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes . The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen by resignation , or otherwise , during the recess of the legislature of any state , the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature , which shall then fill such vacancies . No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years , and been nine years a citizen of the United States and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen . The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate , but shall have no vote , unless they be equally divided . The Senate shall choose their other officers , and also a President pro tempore , in the absence of the Vice President , or when he shall exercise the office of President of the United States . The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments . When sitting for that purpose , they shall be on oath or affirmation . When the President of the United States is tried , the Chief Justice shall preside : And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present . Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office , and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor , trust or profit under the United States : but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment , trial , judgment and punishment , according to law .	0

In Berkemer v. McCarty , 468 U. S. 420 , 439440 ( 1984 ) , followed in Knowles , supra , at 488 , we held that the analogue of the common traffic stop was the limited detention for investigation authorized by Terry v. Ohio , 392 U. S. 1 ( 1968 ) . While Terry authorized a restricted incidental search for weapons when reasonable suspicion warrants such a safety measure , i d . , at 2526 , the Court took care to keep a Terry stop from automatically becoming a foot in the door for all investigatory purposes ; the permissible intrusion was bounded by the justification for the detention , i d . , at 2930 . 5 Although facts disclosed by enquiry within this limit might give grounds to go further , the government could not otherwise take advantage of a suspects immobility to search for evidence unrelated to the reason for the detention . That has to be the rule unless Terry is going to become an open - sesame for general searches , and that rule requires holding that the police do not have reasonable grounds to conduct sniff searches for drugs simply because they have stopped someone to receive a ticket for a highway offense . Since the police had no indication of illegal activity beyond the speed of the car in this case , the sniff search should be held unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and its fruits should be suppressed .	No state shall enter into any treaty , alliance , or confederation ; grant letters of marque and reprisal ; coin money ; emit bills of credit ; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts ; pass any bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or law impairing the obligation of contracts , or grant any title of nobility .

Nothing in the case relied upon by the Court , United States v. Jacobsen , 466 U. S. 109 ( 1984 ) , unsettled the limit of reasonable enquiry adopted in Terry . In Jacobsen , the Court found that no Fourth Amendment search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained . The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine , the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake . 466 U. S. , at 123 .

Nothing in the case relied upon by the Court , United States v. Jacobsen , 466 U. S. 109 ( 1984 ) , unsettled the limit of reasonable enquiry adopted in Terry . In Jacobsen , the Court found that no Fourth Amendment search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained . The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine , the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake . 466 U. S. , at 123 . As already explained , however , the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate Fourth Amendment protection .	All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives .	0
The Court today does not go so far as to say explicitly that sniff searches by dogs trained to sense contraband always get a free pass under the Fourth Amendment , since it reserves judgment on the constitutional significance of sniffs assumed to be more intrusive than a dogs walk around a stopped car , ante , at 4 . For this reason , I do not take the Courts reliance on Jacobsen as actually signaling recognition of a broad authority to conduct suspicionless sniffs for drugs in any parked car , about which Justice Ginsburg is rightly concerned , post , at 56 , or on the person of any pedestrian minding his own business on a sidewalk . But the Courts stated reasoning provides no apparent stopping point short of such excesses .

In United States v. Place , 462 U. S. 696 ( 1983 ) , we categorized the sniff of the narcotics - seeking dog as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment and held it was not a search . Id. , at 707 . The classification rests not only upon the limited nature of the intrusion , but on a further premise that experience has shown to be untenable , the assumption that trained sniffing dogs do not err . What we have learned about the fallibility of dogs in the years since Place was decided would itself be reason to call for reconsidering Place s decision against treating the intentional use of a trained dog as a search . The portent of this very case , however , adds insistence to the call , for an uncritical adherence to Place would render the Fourth Amendment indifferent to suspicionless and indiscriminate sweeps of cars in parking garages and pedestrians on sidewalks ; if a sniff is not preceded by a seizure subject to Fourth Amendment notice , it escapes Fourth Amendment review entirely unless it is treated as a search .

Once the dogs fallibility is recognized , however , that ends the justification claimed in Place for treating the sniff as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment : the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband , and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime . This is not , of course , to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion , or probable cause , to search the container or enclosure ; the Fourth Amendment does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband . The point is simply that the sniff and alert can not claim the certainty that Place assumed , both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as sui generis and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny . And when that aura of uniqueness disappears , there is no basis in Place s reasoning , and no good reason otherwise , to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform . They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive , even when conventionally enhanced . The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations , but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort , which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched . Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures , to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area . And given the fallibility of the dog , the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband , just as a thermal - imaging device might do , as described in Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . 3	All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills .

In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States .

The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .

They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive , even when conventionally enhanced . The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations , but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort , which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched . Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures , to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area . And given the fallibility of the dog , the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband , just as a thermal - imaging device might do , as described in Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . 3	The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude .

It makes sense , then , to treat a sniff as the search that it amounts to in practice , and to rely on the body of our Fourth Amendment cases , including Kyllo , in deciding whether such a search is reasonable . As a general proposition , using a dog to sniff for drugs is subject to the rule that the object of enforcing criminal laws does not , without more , justify suspicionless Fourth Amendment intrusions . See Indianapolis v. Edmond , 531 U. S. 32 , 4142 ( 2000 ) .

It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence , which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest . See Brief for Respondent 31 . There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest , however , see Knowles v. Iowa , 525 U. S. 113 ( 1998 ) , for the police did nothing more than detain Caballes long enough to check his record and write a ticket .

In Berkemer v. McCarty , 468 U. S. 420 , 439440 ( 1984 ) , followed in Knowles , supra , at 488 , we held that the analogue of the common traffic stop was the limited detention for investigation authorized by Terry v. Ohio , 392 U. S. 1 ( 1968 ) . While Terry authorized a restricted incidental search for weapons when reasonable suspicion warrants such a safety measure , i d . , at 2526 , the Court took care to keep a Terry stop from automatically becoming a foot in the door for all investigatory purposes ; the permissible intrusion was bounded by the justification for the detention , i d . , at 2930 . 5 Although facts disclosed by enquiry within this limit might give grounds to go further , the government could not otherwise take advantage of a suspects immobility to search for evidence unrelated to the reason for the detention . That has to be the rule unless Terry is going to become an open - sesame for general searches , and that rule requires holding that the police do not have reasonable grounds to conduct sniff searches for drugs simply because they have stopped someone to receive a ticket for a highway offense . Since the police had no indication of illegal activity beyond the speed of the car in this case , the sniff search should be held unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and its fruits should be suppressed .

The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate .

But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President .

The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

In United States v. Place , 462 U. S. 696 ( 1983 ) , we categorized the sniff of the narcotics - seeking dog as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment and held it was not a search . Id. , at 707 . The classification rests not only upon the limited nature of the intrusion , but on a further premise that experience has shown to be untenable , the assumption that trained sniffing dogs do not err . What we have learned about the fallibility of dogs in the years since Place was decided would itself be reason to call for reconsidering Place s decision against treating the intentional use of a trained dog as a search . The portent of this very case , however , adds insistence to the call , for an uncritical adherence to Place would render the Fourth Amendment indifferent to suspicionless and indiscriminate sweeps of cars in parking garages and pedestrians on sidewalks ; if a sniff is not preceded by a seizure subject to Fourth Amendment notice , it escapes Fourth Amendment review entirely unless it is treated as a search .

In United States v. Place , 462 U. S. 696 ( 1983 ) , we categorized the sniff of the narcotics - seeking dog as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment and held it was not a search . Id. , at 707 . The classification rests not only upon the limited nature of the intrusion , but on a further premise that experience has shown to be untenable , the assumption that trained sniffing dogs do not err .

Once the dogs fallibility is recognized , however , that ends the justification claimed in Place for treating the sniff as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment : the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband , and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime . This is not , of course , to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion , or probable cause , to search the container or enclosure ; the Fourth Amendment does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband . The point is simply that the sniff and alert can not claim the certainty that Place assumed , both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as sui generis and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny . And when that aura of uniqueness disappears , there is no basis in Place s reasoning , and no good reason otherwise , to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform . They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive , even when conventionally enhanced . The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations , but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort , which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched . Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures , to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area . And given the fallibility of the dog , the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband , just as a thermal - imaging device might do , as described in Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . 3	The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex .

It makes sense , then , to treat a sniff as the search that it amounts to in practice , and to rely on the body of our Fourth Amendment cases , including Kyllo , in deciding whether such a search is reasonable . As a general proposition , using a dog to sniff for drugs is subject to the rule that the object of enforcing criminal laws does not , without more , justify suspicionless Fourth Amendment intrusions . See Indianapolis v. Edmond , 531 U. S. 32 , 4142 ( 2000 ) . Since the police claim to have had no particular suspicion that Caballes was violating any drug law , 4 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it . It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence , which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest . See Brief for Respondent 31 . There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest , however , see Knowles v. Iowa , 525 U. S. 113 ( 1998 ) , for the police did nothing more than detain Caballes long enough to check his record and write a ticket .

But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

In Berkemer v. McCarty , 468 U. S. 420 , 439440 ( 1984 ) , followed in Knowles , supra , at 488 , we held that the analogue of the common traffic stop was the limited detention for investigation authorized by Terry v. Ohio , 392 U. S. 1 ( 1968 ) . While Terry authorized a restricted incidental search for weapons when reasonable suspicion warrants such a safety measure , i d . , at 2526 , the Court took care to keep a Terry stop from automatically becoming a foot in the door for all investigatory purposes ; the permissible intrusion was bounded by the justification for the detention , i d . , at 2930 . 5 Although facts disclosed by enquiry within this limit might give grounds to go further , the government could not otherwise take advantage of a suspects immobility to search for evidence unrelated to the reason for the detention . That has to be the rule unless Terry is going to become an open - sesame for general searches , and that rule requires holding that the police do not have reasonable grounds to conduct sniff searches for drugs simply because they have stopped someone to receive a ticket for a highway offense .

Nothing in the case relied upon by the Court , United States v. Jacobsen , 466 U. S. 109 ( 1984 ) , unsettled the limit of reasonable enquiry adopted in Terry . In Jacobsen , the Court found that no Fourth Amendment search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained . The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine , the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake . 466 U. S. , at 123 . As already explained , however , the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate Fourth Amendment protection .	The migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit , shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight , but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation , not exceeding ten dollars for each person . The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended , unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it . No bill of attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed . No capitation , or other direct , tax shall be laid , unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken . No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state . No preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one state over those of another : nor shall vessels bound to , or from , one state , be obliged to enter , clear or pay duties in another . No money shall be drawn from the treasury , but in consequence of appropriations made by law ; and a regular statement and account of receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time . No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States : and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them , shall , without the consent of the Congress , accept of any present , emolument , office , or title , of any kind whatever , from any king , prince , or foreign state .	0

Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other state . And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts , records , and proceedings shall be proved , and the effect thereof . The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states . A person charged in any state with treason , felony , or other crime , who shall flee from justice , and be found in another state , shall on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled , be delivered up , to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime . No person held to service or labor in one state , under the laws thereof , escaping into another , shall , in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due . New states may be admitted by the Congress into this union ; but no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state ; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states , or parts of states , without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress .

The Court today does not go so far as to say explicitly that sniff searches by dogs trained to sense contraband always get a free pass under the Fourth Amendment , since it reserves judgment on the constitutional significance of sniffs assumed to be more intrusive than a dogs walk around a stopped car , ante , at 4 . For this reason , I do not take the Courts reliance on Jacobsen as actually signaling recognition of a broad authority to conduct suspicionless sniffs for drugs in any parked car , about which Justice Ginsburg is rightly concerned , post , at 56 , or on the person of any pedestrian minding his own business on a sidewalk . But the Courts stated reasoning provides no apparent stopping point short of such excesses . For the sake of providing a workable framework to analyze cases on facts like these , which are certain to come along , I would treat the dog sniff as the familiar search it is in fact , subject to scrutiny under the Fourth Amendment . 7	The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services , to be ascertained by law , and paid out of the treasury of the United States . They shall in all cases , except treason , felony and breach of the peace , be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same ; and for any speech or debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other place . No Senator or Representative shall , during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time : and no person holding any office under the United States , shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office .	0

In United States v. Place , 462 U. S. 696 ( 1983 ) , we categorized the sniff of the narcotics - seeking dog as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment and held it was not a search . Id. , at 707 . The classification rests not only upon the limited nature of the intrusion , but on a further premise that experience has shown to be untenable , the assumption that trained sniffing dogs do not err . What we have learned about the fallibility of dogs in the years since Place was decided would itself be reason to call for reconsidering Place s decision against treating the intentional use of a trained dog as a search . The portent of this very case , however , adds insistence to the call , for an uncritical adherence to Place would render the Fourth Amendment indifferent to suspicionless and indiscriminate sweeps of cars in parking garages and pedestrians on sidewalks ; if a sniff is not preceded by a seizure subject to Fourth Amendment notice , it escapes Fourth Amendment review entirely unless it is treated as a search . We should not wait for these developments to occur before rethinking Place s analysis , which invites such untoward consequences . 1	The judicial power of the United States , shall be vested in one Supreme Court , and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish . The judges , both of the supreme and inferior courts , shall hold their offices during good behaviour , and shall , at stated times , receive for their services , a compensation , which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office . The judicial power shall extend to all cases , in law and equity , arising under this Constitution , the laws of the United States , and treaties made , or which shall be made , under their authority ;-- to all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls ;-- to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ;-- to controversies to which the United States shall be a party ;-- to controversies between two or more states ;-- between a state and citizens of another state ;-- between citizens of different states ;-- between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states , and between a state , or the citizens thereof , and foreign states , citizens or subjects . In all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , and those in which a state shall be party , the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction . In all the other cases before mentioned , the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction , both as to law and fact , with such exceptions , and under such regulations as the Congress shall make . The trial of all crimes , except in cases of impeachment , shall be by jury ; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed ; but when not committed within any state , the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed . Treason against the United States , shall consist only in levying war against them , or in adhering to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort . No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act , or on confession in open court .

We should not wait for these developments to occur before rethinking Place s analysis , which invites such untoward consequences . 1	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0

Once the dogs fallibility is recognized , however , that ends the justification claimed in Place for treating the sniff as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment : the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband , and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime . This is not , of course , to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion , or probable cause , to search the container or enclosure ; the Fourth Amendment does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband . The point is simply that the sniff and alert can not claim the certainty that Place assumed , both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as sui generis and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny . And when that aura of uniqueness disappears , there is no basis in Place s reasoning , and no good reason otherwise , to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform . They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive , even when conventionally enhanced . The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations , but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort , which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched . Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures , to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area . And given the fallibility of the dog , the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband , just as a thermal - imaging device might do , as described in Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . 3	The Congress , whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary , shall propose amendments to this Constitution , or , on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states , shall call a convention for proposing amendments , which , in either case , shall be valid to all intents and purposes , as part of this Constitution , when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states , or by conventions in three fourths thereof , as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress ; provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article ; and that no state , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate .	0

It makes sense , then , to treat a sniff as the search that it amounts to in practice , and to rely on the body of our Fourth Amendment cases , including Kyllo , in deciding whether such a search is reasonable . As a general proposition , using a dog to sniff for drugs is subject to the rule that the object of enforcing criminal laws does not , without more , justify suspicionless Fourth Amendment intrusions . See Indianapolis v. Edmond , 531 U. S. 32 , 4142 ( 2000 ) . Since the police claim to have had no particular suspicion that Caballes was violating any drug law , 4 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it . It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence , which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest . See Brief for Respondent 31 . There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest , however , see Knowles v. Iowa , 525 U. S. 113 ( 1998 ) , for the police did nothing more than detain Caballes long enough to check his record and write a ticket . As a consequence , the reasonableness of the search must be assessed in relation to the actual delay the police chose to impose , and as Justice Ginsburg points out in her opinion , post , at 34 , the Fourth Amendment consequences of stopping for a traffic citation are settled law .	He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .	0

In Berkemer v. McCarty , 468 U.

Ohio , 392 U. S. 1 ( 1968 ) . While Terry authorized a restricted incidental search for weapons when reasonable suspicion warrants such a safety measure , i d . , at 2526 , the Court took care to keep a Terry stop from automatically becoming a foot in the door for all investigatory purposes ; the permissible intrusion was bounded by the justification for the detention , i d . , at 2930 . 5 Although facts disclosed by enquiry within this limit might give grounds to go further , the government could not otherwise take advantage of a suspects immobility to search for evidence unrelated to the reason for the detention . That has to be the rule unless Terry is going to become an open - sesame for general searches , and that rule requires holding that the police do not have reasonable grounds to conduct sniff searches for drugs simply because they have stopped someone to receive a ticket for a highway offense .

In United States v. Place , 462 U. S. 696 ( 1983 ) , we categorized the sniff of the narcotics - seeking dog as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment and held it was not a search . Id. , at 707 .

Once the dogs fallibility is recognized , however , that ends the justification claimed in Place for treating the sniff as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment : the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband , and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime . This is not , of course , to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion , or probable cause , to search the container or enclosure ; the Fourth Amendment does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband . The point is simply that the sniff and alert can not claim the certainty that Place assumed , both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as sui generis and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny . And when that aura of uniqueness disappears , there is no basis in Place s reasoning , and no good reason otherwise , to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform . They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive , even when conventionally enhanced . The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations , but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort , which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched . Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures , to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area . And given the fallibility of the dog , the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband , just as a thermal - imaging device might do , as described in Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . 3	No state shall enter into any treaty , alliance , or confederation ; grant letters of marque and reprisal ; coin money ; emit bills of credit ; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts ; pass any bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or law impairing the obligation of contracts , or grant any title of nobility . No state shall , without the consent of the Congress , lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports , except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it 's inspection laws : and the net produce of all duties and imposts , laid by any state on imports or exports , shall be for the use of the treasury of the United States ; and all such laws shall be subject to the revision and control of the Congress . No state shall , without the consent of Congress , lay any duty of tonnage , keep troops , or ships of war in time of peace , enter into any agreement or compact with another state , or with a foreign power , or engage in war , unless actually invaded , or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay .	0

It makes sense , then , to treat a sniff as the search that it amounts to in practice , and to rely on the body of our Fourth Amendment cases , including Kyllo , in deciding whether such a search is reasonable . As a general proposition , using a dog to sniff for drugs is subject to the rule that the object of enforcing criminal laws does not , without more , justify suspicionless Fourth Amendment intrusions .

See Brief for Respondent 31 . There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest , however , see Knowles v. Iowa , 525 U. S. 113 ( 1998 ) , for the police did nothing more than detain Caballes long enough to check his record and write a ticket . As a consequence , the reasonableness of the search must be assessed in relation to the actual delay the police chose to impose , and as Justice Ginsburg points out in her opinion , post , at 34 , the Fourth Amendment consequences of stopping for a traffic citation are settled law .

But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by states , the representation from each state having one vote ; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two - thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . And if the House of Representatives shall not choose a President whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them , before the fourth day of March next following , then the Vice - President shall act as President , as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President .

The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0
It makes sense , then , to treat a sniff as the search that it amounts to in practice , and to rely on the body of our Fourth Amendment cases , including Kyllo , in deciding whether such a search is reasonable . As a general proposition , using a dog to sniff for drugs is subject to the rule that the object of enforcing criminal laws does not , without more , justify suspicionless Fourth Amendment intrusions . See Indianapolis v. Edmond , 531 U. S. 32 , 4142 ( 2000 ) . Since the police claim to have had no particular suspicion that Caballes was violating any drug law , 4 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it . It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence , which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest . See Brief for Respondent 31 . There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest , however , see Knowles v. Iowa , 525 U. S. 113 ( 1998 ) , for the police did nothing more than detain Caballes long enough to check his record and write a ticket . As a consequence , the reasonableness of the search must be assessed in relation to the actual delay the police chose to impose , and as Justice Ginsburg points out in her opinion , post , at 34 , the Fourth Amendment consequences of stopping for a traffic citation are settled law .	All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives . The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states , and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature . No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty five years , and been seven years a citizen of the United States , and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen . Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union , according to their respective numbers , which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons , including those bound to service for a term of years , and excluding Indians not taxed , three fifths of all other Persons . The actual Enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States , and within every subsequent term of ten years , in such manner as they shall by law direct . The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand , but each state shall have at least one Representative ; and until such enumeration shall be made , the state of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three , Massachusetts eight , Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one , Connecticut five , New York six , New Jersey four , Pennsylvania eight , Delaware one , Maryland six , Virginia ten , North Carolina five , South Carolina five , and Georgia three . When vacancies happen in the Representation from any state , the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies . The House of Representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers ; and shall have the sole power of impeachment . The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state , chosen by the legislature thereof , for six years ; and each Senator shall have one vote . Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election , they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes . The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen by resignation , or otherwise , during the recess of the legislature of any state , the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature , which shall then fill such vacancies . No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years , and been nine years a citizen of the United States and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen . The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate , but shall have no vote , unless they be equally divided . The Senate shall choose their other officers , and also a President pro tempore , in the absence of the Vice President , or when he shall exercise the office of President of the United States . The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments . When sitting for that purpose , they shall be on oath or affirmation . When the President of the United States is tried , the Chief Justice shall preside : And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present . Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office , and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor , trust or profit under the United States : but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment , trial , judgment and punishment , according to law . The times , places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives , shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof ; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations , except as to the places of choosing Senators . The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year , and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December , unless they shall by law appoint a different day . Each House shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members , and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business ; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day , and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members , in such manner , and under such penalties as each House may provide . Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings , punish its members for disorderly behavior , and , with the concurrence of two thirds , expel a member . Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings , and from time to time publish the same , excepting such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy ; and the yeas and nays of the members of either House on any question shall , at the desire of one fifth of those present , be entered on the journal . Neither House , during the session of Congress , shall , without the consent of the other , adjourn for more than three days , nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting . The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services , to be ascertained by law , and paid out of the treasury of the United States . They shall in all cases , except treason , felony and breach of the peace , be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same ; and for any speech or debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other place . No Senator or Representative shall , during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time : and no person holding any office under the United States , shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office . All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it become a law , be presented to the President of the United States ; if he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it . If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law . But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays , and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively . If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall have been presented to him , the same shall be a law , in like manner as if he had signed it , unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return , in which case it shall not be a law . Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill . The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises , to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States ; but all duties , imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States ; To borrow money on the credit of the United States ; To regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several states , and with the Indian tribes ; To establish a uniform rule of naturalization , and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States ; To coin money , regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin , and fix the standard of weights and measures ; To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States ; To establish post offices and post roads ; To promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries ; To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court ; To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas , and offenses against the law of nations ; To declare war , grant letters of marque and reprisal , and make rules concerning captures on land and water ; To raise and support armies , but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years ; To provide and maintain a navy ; To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces ; To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union , suppress insurrections and repel invasions ; To provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining , the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , reserving to the states respectively , the appointment of the officers , and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress ; To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten miles square ) as may , by cession of particular states , and the acceptance of Congress , become the seat of the government of the United States , and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be , for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , dockyards , and other needful buildings ;-- And To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof . The migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit , shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight , but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation , not exceeding ten dollars for each person . The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended , unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it .

No state shall enter into any treaty , alliance , or confederation ; grant letters of marque and reprisal ; coin money ; emit bills of credit ; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts ; pass any bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or law impairing the obligation of contracts , or grant any title of nobility .

In Berkemer v. McCarty , 468 U. S. 420 , 439440 ( 1984 ) , followed in Knowles , supra , at 488 , we held that the analogue of the common traffic stop was the limited detention for investigation authorized by Terry v. Ohio , 392 U. S. 1 ( 1968 ) . While Terry authorized a restricted incidental search for weapons when reasonable suspicion warrants such a safety measure , i d . , at 2526 , the Court took care to keep a Terry stop from automatically becoming a foot in the door for all investigatory purposes ; the permissible intrusion was bounded by the justification for the detention , i d . , at 2930 . 5 Although facts disclosed by enquiry within this limit might give grounds to go further , the government could not otherwise take advantage of a suspects immobility to search for evidence unrelated to the reason for the detention . That has to be the rule unless Terry is going to become an open - sesame for general searches , and that rule requires holding that the police do not have reasonable grounds to conduct sniff searches for drugs simply because they have stopped someone to receive a ticket for a highway offense . Since the police had no indication of illegal activity beyond the speed of the car in this case , the sniff search should be held unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and its fruits should be suppressed .	No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice , and no person who has held the office of President , or acted as President , for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once . But this article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this article was proposed by the Congress , and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President , or acting as President , during the term within which this article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term . This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three - fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states by the Congress .	0
Nothing in the case relied upon by the Court , United States v. Jacobsen , 466 U. S. 109 ( 1984 ) , unsettled the limit of reasonable enquiry adopted in Terry . In Jacobsen , the Court found that no Fourth Amendment search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained . The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine , the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake . 466 U. S. , at 123 . As already explained , however , the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate Fourth Amendment protection .	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0

The Court today does not go so far as to say explicitly that sniff searches by dogs trained to sense contraband always get a free pass under the Fourth Amendment , since it reserves judgment on the constitutional significance of sniffs assumed to be more intrusive than a dogs walk around a stopped car , ante , at 4 . For this reason , I do not take the Courts reliance on Jacobsen as actually signaling recognition of a broad authority to conduct suspicionless sniffs for drugs in any parked car , about which Justice Ginsburg is rightly concerned , post , at 56 , or on the person of any pedestrian minding his own business on a sidewalk . But the Courts stated reasoning provides no apparent stopping point short of such excesses . For the sake of providing a workable framework to analyze cases on facts like these , which are certain to come along , I would treat the dog sniff as the familiar search it is in fact , subject to scrutiny under the Fourth Amendment . 7	He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .	0

Once the dogs fallibility is recognized , however , that ends the justification claimed in Place for treating the sniff as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment : the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband , and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime . This is not , of course , to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion , or probable cause , to search the container or enclosure ; the Fourth Amendment does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband . The point is simply that the sniff and alert can not claim the certainty that Place assumed , both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as sui generis and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny . And when that aura of uniqueness disappears , there is no basis in Place s reasoning , and no good reason otherwise , to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform . They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive , even when conventionally enhanced . The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations , but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort , which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched . Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures , to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area . And given the fallibility of the dog , the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband , just as a thermal - imaging device might do , as described in Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . 3	The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0

It makes sense , then , to treat a sniff as the search that it amounts to in practice , and to rely on the body of our Fourth Amendment cases , including Kyllo , in deciding whether such a search is reasonable . As a general proposition , using a dog to sniff for drugs is subject to the rule that the object of enforcing criminal laws does not , without more , justify suspicionless Fourth Amendment intrusions . See Indianapolis v. Edmond , 531 U. S. 32 , 4142 ( 2000 ) . Since the police claim to have had no particular suspicion that Caballes was violating any drug law , 4 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it . It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence , which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest . See Brief for Respondent 31 . There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest , however , see Knowles v. Iowa , 525 U. S. 113 ( 1998 ) , for the police did nothing more than detain Caballes long enough to check his record and write a ticket . As a consequence , the reasonableness of the search must be assessed in relation to the actual delay the police chose to impose , and as Justice Ginsburg points out in her opinion , post , at 34 , the Fourth Amendment consequences of stopping for a traffic citation are settled law .

In Berkemer v. McCarty , 468 U.

Ohio , 392 U. S. 1 ( 1968 ) . While Terry authorized a restricted incidental search for weapons when reasonable suspicion warrants such a safety measure , i d . , at 2526 , the Court took care to keep a Terry stop from automatically becoming a foot in the door for all investigatory purposes ; the permissible intrusion was bounded by the justification for the detention , i d . , at 2930 . 5 Although facts disclosed by enquiry within this limit might give grounds to go further , the government could not otherwise take advantage of a suspects immobility to search for evidence unrelated to the reason for the detention . That has to be the rule unless Terry is going to become an open - sesame for general searches , and that rule requires holding that the police do not have reasonable grounds to conduct sniff searches for drugs simply because they have stopped someone to receive a ticket for a highway offense .

The Court today does not go so far as to say explicitly that sniff searches by dogs trained to sense contraband always get a free pass under the Fourth Amendment , since it reserves judgment on the constitutional significance of sniffs assumed to be more intrusive than a dogs walk around a stopped car , ante , at 4 . For this reason , I do not take the Courts reliance on Jacobsen as actually signaling recognition of a broad authority to conduct suspicionless sniffs for drugs in any parked car , about which Justice Ginsburg is rightly concerned , post , at 56 , or on the person of any pedestrian minding his own business on a sidewalk . But the Courts stated reasoning provides no apparent stopping point short of such excesses .

In United States v. Place , 462 U. S. 696 ( 1983 ) , we categorized the sniff of the narcotics - seeking dog as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment and held it was not a search . Id. , at 707 . The classification rests not only upon the limited nature of the intrusion , but on a further premise that experience has shown to be untenable , the assumption that trained sniffing dogs do not err . What we have learned about the fallibility of dogs in the years since Place was decided would itself be reason to call for reconsidering Place s decision against treating the intentional use of a trained dog as a search . The portent of this very case , however , adds insistence to the call , for an uncritical adherence to Place would render the Fourth Amendment indifferent to suspicionless and indiscriminate sweeps of cars in parking garages and pedestrians on sidewalks ; if a sniff is not preceded by a seizure subject to Fourth Amendment notice , it escapes Fourth Amendment review entirely unless it is treated as a search .

Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide , transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office , the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President .

Once the dogs fallibility is recognized , however , that ends the justification claimed in Place for treating the sniff as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment : the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband , and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime . This is not , of course , to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion , or probable cause , to search the container or enclosure ; the Fourth Amendment does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband . The point is simply that the sniff and alert can not claim the certainty that Place assumed , both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as sui generis and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny . And when that aura of uniqueness disappears , there is no basis in Place s reasoning , and no good reason otherwise , to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform . They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive , even when conventionally enhanced . The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations , but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort , which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched . Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures , to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area . And given the fallibility of the dog , the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband , just as a thermal - imaging device might do , as described in Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . 3	The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes , from whatever source derived , without apportionment among the several states , and without regard to any census or enumeration .	0

It makes sense , then , to treat a sniff as the search that it amounts to in practice , and to rely on the body of our Fourth Amendment cases , including Kyllo , in deciding whether such a search is reasonable . As a general proposition , using a dog to sniff for drugs is subject to the rule that the object of enforcing criminal laws does not , without more , justify suspicionless Fourth Amendment intrusions . See Indianapolis v. Edmond , 531 U. S. 32 , 4142 ( 2000 ) . Since the police claim to have had no particular suspicion that Caballes was violating any drug law , 4 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it . It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence , which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest . See Brief for Respondent 31 . There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest , however , see Knowles v. Iowa , 525 U. S. 113 ( 1998 ) , for the police did nothing more than detain Caballes long enough to check his record and write a ticket . As a consequence , the reasonableness of the search must be assessed in relation to the actual delay the police chose to impose , and as Justice Ginsburg points out in her opinion , post , at 34 , the Fourth Amendment consequences of stopping for a traffic citation are settled law .

The Congress may by law provide for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the House of Representatives may choose a President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them , and for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the Senate may choose a Vice President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them .

In Berkemer v. McCarty , 468 U. S. 420 , 439440 ( 1984 ) , followed in Knowles , supra , at 488 , we held that the analogue of the common traffic stop was the limited detention for investigation authorized by Terry v. Ohio , 392 U. S. 1 ( 1968 ) . While Terry authorized a restricted incidental search for weapons when reasonable suspicion warrants such a safety measure , i d . , at 2526 , the Court took care to keep a Terry stop from automatically becoming a foot in the door for all investigatory purposes ; the permissible intrusion was bounded by the justification for the detention , i d . , at 2930 . 5 Although facts disclosed by enquiry within this limit might give grounds to go further , the government could not otherwise take advantage of a suspects immobility to search for evidence unrelated to the reason for the detention . That has to be the rule unless Terry is going to become an open - sesame for general searches , and that rule requires holding that the police do not have reasonable grounds to conduct sniff searches for drugs simply because they have stopped someone to receive a ticket for a highway offense . Since the police had no indication of illegal activity beyond the speed of the car in this case , the sniff search should be held unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and its fruits should be suppressed .

Nothing in the case relied upon by the Court , United States v. Jacobsen , 466 U. S. 109 ( 1984 ) , unsettled the limit of reasonable enquiry adopted in Terry . In Jacobsen , the Court found that no Fourth Amendment search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained . The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine , the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake . 466 U. S. , at 123 . As already explained , however , the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate Fourth Amendment protection .

The Court today does not go so far as to say explicitly that sniff searches by dogs trained to sense contraband always get a free pass under the Fourth Amendment , since it reserves judgment on the constitutional significance of sniffs assumed to be more intrusive than a dogs walk around a stopped car , ante , at 4 . For this reason , I do not take the Courts reliance on Jacobsen as actually signaling recognition of a broad authority to conduct suspicionless sniffs for drugs in any parked car , about which Justice Ginsburg is rightly concerned , post , at 56 , or on the person of any pedestrian minding his own business on a sidewalk . But the Courts stated reasoning provides no apparent stopping point short of such excesses .

Once the dogs fallibility is recognized , however , that ends the justification claimed in Place for treating the sniff as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment : the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband , and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime . This is not , of course , to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion , or probable cause , to search the container or enclosure ; the Fourth Amendment does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband . The point is simply that the sniff and alert can not claim the certainty that Place assumed , both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as sui generis and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny . And when that aura of uniqueness disappears , there is no basis in Place s reasoning , and no good reason otherwise , to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform . They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive , even when conventionally enhanced . The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations , but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort , which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched . Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures , to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area . And given the fallibility of the dog , the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband , just as a thermal - imaging device might do , as described in Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . 3	Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted .	0

Once the dogs fallibility is recognized , however , that ends the justification claimed in Place for treating the sniff as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment : the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband , and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime . This is not , of course , to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion , or probable cause , to search the container or enclosure ; the Fourth Amendment does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband . The point is simply that the sniff and alert can not claim the certainty that Place assumed , both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as sui generis and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny . And when that aura of uniqueness disappears , there is no basis in Place s reasoning , and no good reason otherwise , to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform . They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive , even when conventionally enhanced . The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations , but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort , which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched . Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures , to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area . And given the fallibility of the dog , the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband , just as a thermal - imaging device might do , as described in Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . 3	The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state , elected by the people thereof , for six years ; and each Senator shall have one vote .

It makes sense , then , to treat a sniff as the search that it amounts to in practice , and to rely on the body of our Fourth Amendment cases , including Kyllo , in deciding whether such a search is reasonable . As a general proposition , using a dog to sniff for drugs is subject to the rule that the object of enforcing criminal laws does not , without more , justify suspicionless Fourth Amendment intrusions . See Indianapolis v. Edmond , 531 U. S. 32 , 4142 ( 2000 ) . Since the police claim to have had no particular suspicion that Caballes was violating any drug law , 4 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it . It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence , which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest . See Brief for Respondent 31 . There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest , however , see Knowles v. Iowa , 525 U. S. 113 ( 1998 ) , for the police did nothing more than detain Caballes long enough to check his record and write a ticket . As a consequence , the reasonableness of the search must be assessed in relation to the actual delay the police chose to impose , and as Justice Ginsburg points out in her opinion , post , at 34 , the Fourth Amendment consequences of stopping for a traffic citation are settled law .	The judicial power of the United States , shall be vested in one Supreme Court , and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish . The judges , both of the supreme and inferior courts , shall hold their offices during good behaviour , and shall , at stated times , receive for their services , a compensation , which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office .	0
In Berkemer v. McCarty , 468 U. S. 420 , 439440 ( 1984 ) , followed in Knowles , supra , at 488 , we held that the analogue of the common traffic stop was the limited detention for investigation authorized by Terry v. Ohio , 392 U. S. 1 ( 1968 ) . While Terry authorized a restricted incidental search for weapons when reasonable suspicion warrants such a safety measure , i d . , at 2526 , the Court took care to keep a Terry stop from automatically becoming a foot in the door for all investigatory purposes ; the permissible intrusion was bounded by the justification for the detention , i d . , at 2930 . 5 Although facts disclosed by enquiry within this limit might give grounds to go further , the government could not otherwise take advantage of a suspects immobility to search for evidence unrelated to the reason for the detention . That has to be the rule unless Terry is going to become an open - sesame for general searches , and that rule requires holding that the police do not have reasonable grounds to conduct sniff searches for drugs simply because they have stopped someone to receive a ticket for a highway offense . Since the police had no indication of illegal activity beyond the speed of the car in this case , the sniff search should be held unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and its fruits should be suppressed .	The eighteenth article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed . The transportation or importation into any state , territory , or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors , in violation of the laws thereof , is hereby prohibited . This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by conventions in the several states , as provided in the Constitution , within seven years from the date of the submission hereof to the states by the Congress .	0
Nothing in the case relied upon by the Court , United States v. Jacobsen , 466 U. S. 109 ( 1984 ) , unsettled the limit of reasonable enquiry adopted in Terry . In Jacobsen , the Court found that no Fourth Amendment search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained . The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine , the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake . 466 U. S. , at 123 . As already explained , however , the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate Fourth Amendment protection .	No soldier shall , in time of peace be quartered in any house , without the consent of the owner , nor in time of war , but in a manner to be prescribed by law .	0
The Court today does not go so far as to say explicitly that sniff searches by dogs trained to sense contraband always get a free pass under the Fourth Amendment , since it reserves judgment on the constitutional significance of sniffs assumed to be more intrusive than a dogs walk around a stopped car , ante , at 4 . For this reason , I do not take the Courts reliance on Jacobsen as actually signaling recognition of a broad authority to conduct suspicionless sniffs for drugs in any parked car , about which Justice Ginsburg is rightly concerned , post , at 56 , or on the person of any pedestrian minding his own business on a sidewalk . But the Courts stated reasoning provides no apparent stopping point short of such excesses . For the sake of providing a workable framework to analyze cases on facts like these , which are certain to come along , I would treat the dog sniff as the familiar search it is in fact , subject to scrutiny under the Fourth Amendment . 7	The judicial power shall extend to all cases , in law and equity , arising under this Constitution , the laws of the United States , and treaties made , or which shall be made , under their authority ;-- to all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls ;-- to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ;-- to controversies to which the United States shall be a party ;-- to controversies between two or more states ;-- between a state and citizens of another state ;-- between citizens of different states ;-- between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states , and between a state , or the citizens thereof , and foreign states , citizens or subjects . In all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , and those in which a state shall be party , the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction . In all the other cases before mentioned , the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction , both as to law and fact , with such exceptions , and under such regulations as the Congress shall make . The trial of all crimes , except in cases of impeachment , shall be by jury ; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed ; but when not committed within any state , the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed .	0
In United States v. Place , 462 U. S. 696 ( 1983 ) , we categorized the sniff of the narcotics - seeking dog as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment and held it was not a search . Id. , at 707 . The classification rests not only upon the limited nature of the intrusion , but on a further premise that experience has shown to be untenable , the assumption that trained sniffing dogs do not err . What we have learned about the fallibility of dogs in the years since Place was decided would itself be reason to call for reconsidering Place s decision against treating the intentional use of a trained dog as a search . The portent of this very case , however , adds insistence to the call , for an uncritical adherence to Place would render the Fourth Amendment indifferent to suspicionless and indiscriminate sweeps of cars in parking garages and pedestrians on sidewalks ; if a sniff is not preceded by a seizure subject to Fourth Amendment notice , it escapes Fourth Amendment review entirely unless it is treated as a search . We should not wait for these developments to occur before rethinking Place s analysis , which invites such untoward consequences . 1	Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other state .

No person held to service or labor in one state , under the laws thereof , escaping into another , shall , in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due .

The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States ; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States , or of any particular state .

The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate .

But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them .

The Court today does not go so far as to say explicitly that sniff searches by dogs trained to sense contraband always get a free pass under the Fourth Amendment , since it reserves judgment on the constitutional significance of sniffs assumed to be more intrusive than a dogs walk around a stopped car , ante , at 4 . For this reason , I do not take the Courts reliance on Jacobsen as actually signaling recognition of a broad authority to conduct suspicionless sniffs for drugs in any parked car , about which Justice Ginsburg is rightly concerned , post , at 56 , or on the person of any pedestrian minding his own business on a sidewalk . But the Courts stated reasoning provides no apparent stopping point short of such excesses . For the sake of providing a workable framework to analyze cases on facts like these , which are certain to come along , I would treat the dog sniff as the familiar search it is in fact , subject to scrutiny under the Fourth Amendment . 7	In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation , the Vice President shall become President . Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President , the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress . Whenever the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office , and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary , such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President . Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide , transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office , the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President . Thereafter , when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists , he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide , transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office . Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue , assembling within forty - eight hours for that purpose if not in session . If the Congress , within twenty - one days after receipt of the latter written declaration , or , if Congress is not in session , within twenty - one days after Congress is required to assemble , determines by two - thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office , the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President ; otherwise , the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office .	0
Mendez and Garcia sued Deputies Conley and Pederson and the County under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 , pressing three Fourth Amendment claims : a warrantless entry claim , a knock - and - announce claim , and an excessive force claim . On the first two claims , the District Court awarded Mendez and Garcia nominal damages . On the excessive force claim , the court found that the deputies’ use of force was reasonable under Graham v. Connor , 490 U. S. 386 , but held them liable nonetheless under the Ninth Circuit ’s provocation rule , which makes an officer ’s otherwise reasonable use of force unreasonable if ( 1 ) the officer “ intentionally or recklessly provokes a violent confrontation ” and ( 2 ) “ the provocation is an independent Fourth Amendment violation , ” Billington v. Smith , 292 F. 3d 1177 , 1189 . On appeal , the Ninth Circuit held that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity on the knock - and - announce claim and that the warrantless entry violated clearly established law . It also affirmed the District Court ’s application of the provocation rule , and held , in the alternative , that basic notions of proximate cause would support liability even without the provocation rule .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	1

He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector .

The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate .

The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them .

" The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0

The basic problem with the provocation rule is that it fails to stop there . Instead , the rule provides a novel and unsupported path to liability in cases in which the use of force was reasonable . Specifically , it instructs courts to look back in time to see if there was a different Fourth Amendment violation that is somehow tied to the eventual use of force . That distinct violation , rather than the forceful seizure itself , may then serve as the foundation of the plaintiff ’s excessive force claim . Billington , supra , at 1190 ( “ The basis of liability for the subsequent use of force is the initial constitutional violation . . . ” ) .

He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .

By conflating excessive force claims with other Fourth Amendment claims , the provocation rule permits excessive force claims that can not succeed on their own terms . That is precisely how the rule operated in this case . The District Court found ( and the Ninth Circuit did not dispute ) that the use of force by the deputies was reasonable under Graham . However , respondents were still able to recover damages because the deputies committed a separate constitutional violation ( the warrantless entry into the shack ) that in some sense set the table for the use of force . That is wrong . The framework for analyzing excessive force claims is set out in Graham . If there is no excessive force claim under Graham , there is no excessive force claim at all . To the extent that a plaintiff has other Fourth Amendment claims , they should be analyzed separately . 1 *	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	1

The Ninth Circuit ’s efforts to cabin the provocation rule only undermine it further . The Ninth Circuit appears to recognize that it would be going entirely too far to suggest that any Fourth Amendment violation that is connected to a reasonable use of force should create a valid excessive force claim . See , e.g. , Beier v. Lewiston , 354 F. 3d 1058 , 1064 ( CA9 2004 ) ( “ Because the excessive force and false arrest factual inquiries are distinct , establishing a lack of probable cause to make an arrest does not establish an excessive force claim , and vice - versa ” ) . Instead , that court has endeavored to limit the rule to only those distinct Fourth Amendment violations that in some sense “ provoked ” the need to use force . The concept of provocation , in turn , has been defined using a two - prong test . First , the separate constitutional violation must “ creat[e ] a situation which led to ” the use of force ; second , the separate constitutional violation must be committed recklessly or intentionally . 815 F. 3d , at 1193 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	1

Neither of these limitations solves the fundamental problem of the provocation rule : namely , that it is an unwarranted and illogical expansion of Graham . But in addition , each of the limitations creates problems of its own . First , the rule includes a vague causal standard . It applies when a prior constitutional violation “ created a situation which led to ” the use of force . The rule does not incorporate the familiar proximate cause standard . Indeed , it is not clear what causal standard is being applied . Second , while the reasonableness of a search or seizure is almost always based on objective factors , see Whren v. United States , 517 U. S. 806 , 814 ( 1996 ) , the provocation rule looks to the subjective intent of the officers who carried out the seizure . As noted , under the Ninth Circuit ’s rule , a prior Fourth Amendment violation may be held to have provoked a later , reasonable use of force only if the prior violation was intentional or reckless .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	1

The provocation rule may be motivated by the notion that it is important to hold law enforcement officers liable for the foreseeable consequences of all of their constitutional torts . See Billington , 292 F. 3d , at 1190 ( “ [ I]f an officer ’s provocative actions are objectively unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment , . . . liability is established , and the question becomes . . . what harms the constitutional violation proximately caused ” ) . However , there is no need to distort the excessive force inquiry in order to accomplish this objective . To the contrary , both parties accept the principle that plaintiffs can — subject to qualified immunity — generally recover damages that are proximately caused by any Fourth Amendment violation . See , e.g. , Heck v. Humphrey , 512 U. S. 477 , 483 ( 1994 ) ( § 1983 “ creates a species of tort liability ” informed by tort principles regarding “ damages and the prerequisites for their recovery ” ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) ; Memphis Community School Dist . v.

S. 299 , 306 ( 1986 ) ( “ [ W]hen § 1983 plaintiffs seek damages for violations of constitutional rights , the level of damages is ordinarily determined according to principles derived from the common law of torts ” ) . Thus , there is no need to dress up every Fourth Amendment claim as an excessive force claim . For example , if the plaintiffs in this case can not recover on their excessive force claim , that will not foreclose recovery for injuries proximately caused by the warrantless entry . The harm proximately caused by these two torts may overlap , but the two claims should not be confused .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	1

No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia , when in actual service in time of war or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation .	0
The provocation rule may be motivated by the notion that it is important to hold law enforcement officers liable for the foreseeable consequences of all of their constitutional torts . See Billington , 292 F. 3d , at 1190 ( “ [ I]f an officer ’s provocative actions are objectively unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment , . . . liability is established , and the question becomes . . . what harms the constitutional violation proximately caused ” ) . However , there is no need to distort the excessive force inquiry in order to accomplish this objective . To the contrary , both parties accept the principle that plaintiffs can — subject to qualified immunity — generally recover damages that are proximately caused by any Fourth Amendment violation . See , e.g. , Heck v. Humphrey , 512 U.

S. 299 , 306 ( 1986 ) ( “ [ W]hen § 1983 plaintiffs seek damages for violations of constitutional rights , the level of damages is ordinarily determined according to principles derived from the common law of torts ” ) .

Unfortunately , the Court of Appeals’ proximate cause analysis appears to have been tainted by the same errors that cause us to reject the provocation rule .

But this appears to focus solely on the risks foreseeably associated with the failure to knock and announce , which could not serve as the basis for liability since the Court of Appeals concluded that the officers had qualified immunity on that claim . By contrast , the Court of Appeals did not identify the foreseeable risks associated with the relevant constitutional violation ( the warrantless entry ) ; nor did it explain how , on these facts , respondents’ injuries were proximately caused by the warrantless entry . In other words , the Court of Appeals’ proximate cause analysis , like the provocation rule , conflated distinct Fourth Amendment claims and required only a murky causal link between the warrantless entry and the injuries attributed to it . On remand , the court should revisit the question whether proximate cause permits respondents to recover damages for their shooting injuries based on the deputies’ failure to secure a warrant at the outset . See Bank of America Corp. v. Miami , ante , at 12 ( declining to “ draw the precise boundaries of proximate cause ” in the first instance ) .

( b ) The Sixth Amendment violation is not subject to harmless - error analysis . Erroneous deprivation of the right to counsel of choice , with consequences that are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate , unquestionably qualifies as structural error.  Sullivan v. Louisiana , 508 U. S. 275 . It def[ies ] analysis by harmless error standards because it affec[ts ] the framework within which the trial proceeds and is not simply an error in the trial process itself. Arizona v. Fulminante , 499 U. S. 279 .

Having concluded , in light of the Governments concession of erroneous deprivation , that the trial court violated respondents Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice , we must consider whether this error is subject to review for harmlessness . In Arizona v. Fulminante , 499 U. S. 279 ( 1991 ) , we divided constitutional errors into two classes . The first we called trial error, because the errors occurred during presentation of the case to the jury and their effect may be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether [ they were ] harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. , at 307308 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . These include most constitutional errors. Id. , at 306 . The second class of constitutional error we called structural defects. These defy analysis by harmless - error standards because they affec[t ] the framework within which the trial proceeds, and are not simply an error in the trial process itself. Id. , at 309310 . 4 See also Neder v. United States , 527 U. S. 1 , 79 ( 1999 ) . Such errors include the denial of counsel , see Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U. S. 335 ( 1963 ) , the denial of the right of self - representation , see McKaskle v. Wiggins , 465 U. S. 168 , n. 8 ( 1984 ) , the denial of the right to public trial , see Waller v. Georgia , 467 U.

Nothing we have said today casts any doubt or places any qualification upon our previous holdings that limit the right to counsel of choice and recognize the authority of trial courts to establish criteria for admitting lawyers to argue before them . As the dissent too discusses , post , at 3 , the right to counsel of choice does not extend to defendants who require counsel to be appointed for them . See Wheat , 486 U. S. , at 159 ; Caplin & Drysdale , 491 U. S. , at 624 , 626 . Nor may a defendant insist on representation by a person who is not a member of the bar , or demand that a court honor his waiver of conflict - free representation . See Wheat , 486 U.

The court has , moreover , an independent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them. Wheat , supra , at 160 . None of these limitations on the right to choose ones counsel is relevant here . This is not a case about a courts power to enforce rules or adhere to practices that determine which attorneys may appear before it , or to make scheduling and other decisions that effectively exclude a defendants first choice of counsel . However broad a courts discretion may be , the Government has conceded that the District Court here erred when it denied respondent his choice of counsel .

The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .

Stated as broadly as this , the Governments argument in effect reads the Sixth Amendment as a more detailed version of the Due Process Clauseand then proceeds to give no effect to the details . It is true enough that the purpose of the rights set forth in that Amendment is to ensure a fair trial ; but it does not follow that the rights can be disregarded so long as the trial is , on the whole , fair . What the Government urges upon us here is what was urged upon us ( successfully , at one time , see Ohio v. Roberts , 448 U. S. 56 ( 1980 ) ) with regard to the Sixth Amendments right of confrontationa line of reasoning that abstracts from the right to its purposes , and then eliminates the right. Maryland v. Craig , 497 U. S. 836 , 862 ( 1990 ) ( Scalia , J. , dissenting ) . Since , it was argued , the purpose of the Confrontation Clause was to ensure the reliability of evidence , so long as the testimonial hearsay bore indicia of reliability, the Confrontation Clause was not violated . See Roberts , supra , at 6566 . We rejected that argument ( and our prior cases that had accepted it ) in Crawford v. Washington , 541 U. S. 36 ( 2004 ) , saying that the Confrontation Clause commands , not that evidence be reliable , but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner : by testing in the crucible of cross - examination. Id. , at 61 .

The earliest case generally cited for the proposition that the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel, McMann v. Richardson , 397 U.

And even our recognition of the right to effective counsel within the Sixth Amendment was a consequence of our perception that representation by counsel is critical to the ability of the adversarial system to produce just results. Strickland , supra , at 685 . Having derived the right to effective representation from the purpose of ensuring a fair trial , we have , logically enough , also derived the limits of that right from that same purpose . See Mickens , supra , at 166 . The requirement that a defendant show prejudice in effective representation cases arises from the very nature of the specific element of the right to counsel at issue thereeffective ( not mistake - free ) representation . Counsel can not be ineffective unless his mistakes have harmed the defense ( or , at least , unless it is reasonably likely that they have ) . Thus , a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to effective representation is not complete until the defendant is prejudiced . See Strickland , supra , at 685 .

The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves .

He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .

The right to select counsel of ones choice , by contrast , has never been derived from the Sixth Amendments purpose of ensuring a fair trial . 3 It has been regarded as the root meaning of the constitutional guarantee .

Deprivation of the right is complete when the defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants , regardless of the quality of the representation he received . To argue otherwise is to confuse the right to counsel of choicewhich is the right to a particular lawyer regardless of comparative effectivenesswith the right to effective counselwhich imposes a baseline requirement of competence on whatever lawyer is chosen or appointed .

Having concluded , in light of the Governments concession of erroneous deprivation , that the trial court violated respondents Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice , we must consider whether this error is subject to review for harmlessness . In Arizona v. Fulminante , 499 U. S. 279 ( 1991 ) , we divided constitutional errors into two classes . The first we called trial error, because the errors occurred during presentation of the case to the jury and their effect may be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether [ they were ] harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. , at 307308 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . These include most constitutional errors. Id. , at 306 . The second class of constitutional error we called structural defects. These defy analysis by harmless - error standards because they affec[t ] the framework within which the trial proceeds, and are not simply an error in the trial process itself. Id. , at 309310 . 4 See also Neder v.

Nothing we have said today casts any doubt or places any qualification upon our previous holdings that limit the right to counsel of choice and recognize the authority of trial courts to establish criteria for admitting lawyers to argue before them . As the dissent too discusses , post , at 3 , the right to counsel of choice does not extend to defendants who require counsel to be appointed for them . See Wheat , 486 U. S. , at 159 ; Caplin & Drysdale , 491 U. S. , at 624 , 626 . Nor may a defendant insist on representation by a person who is not a member of the bar , or demand that a court honor his waiver of conflict - free representation . See Wheat , 486 U.

This is not a case about a courts power to enforce rules or adhere to practices that determine which attorneys may appear before it , or to make scheduling and other decisions that effectively exclude a defendants first choice of counsel . However broad a courts discretion may be , the Government has conceded that the District Court here erred when it denied respondent his choice of counsel .

The Sixth Amendment provides that [i]n all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right … to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence. We have previously held that an element of this right is the right of a defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him .

Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings , punish its members for disorderly behavior , and , with the concurrence of two thirds , expel a member .

But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States .

The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

S. 36 ( 2004 ) , saying that the Confrontation Clause commands , not that evidence be reliable , but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner : by testing in the crucible of cross - examination. Id. , at 61 .

The cases the Government relies on involve the right to the effective assistance of counsel , the violation of which generally requires a defendant to establish prejudice . See , e.g. , Strickland , supra , at 694 ; Mickens , supra , at 166 ; United States v. Cronic , 466 U. S. 648 ( 1984 ) . The earliest case generally cited for the proposition that the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel, McMann v. Richardson , 397 U. S. 759 , n. 14 ( 1970 ) , was based on the Due Process Clause rather than on the Sixth Amendment , see Powell , 287 U. S. , at 57 ( cited in e.g. , McMann , supra , at 771 , n. 14 ) . And even our recognition of the right to effective counsel within the Sixth Amendment was a consequence of our perception that representation by counsel is critical to the ability of the adversarial system to produce just results. Strickland , supra , at 685 . Having derived the right to effective representation from the purpose of ensuring a fair trial , we have , logically enough , also derived the limits of that right from that same purpose . See Mickens , supra , at 166 . The requirement that a defendant show prejudice in effective representation cases arises from the very nature of the specific element of the right to counsel at issue thereeffective ( not mistake - free ) representation . Counsel can not be ineffective unless his mistakes have harmed the defense ( or , at least , unless it is reasonably likely that they have ) . Thus , a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to effective representation is not complete until the defendant is prejudiced . See Strickland , supra , at 685 .	No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia , when in actual service in time of war or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation .	0

In Arizona v. Fulminante , 499 U. S. 279 ( 1991 ) , we divided constitutional errors into two classes . The first we called trial error, because the errors occurred during presentation of the case to the jury and their effect may be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether [ they were ] harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. , at 307308 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . These include most constitutional errors. Id. , at 306 . The second class of constitutional error we called structural defects. These defy analysis by harmless - error standards because they affec[t ] the framework within which the trial proceeds, and are not simply an error in the trial process itself. Id. , at 309310 . 4 See also Neder v. United States , 527 U. S. 1 , 79 ( 1999 ) . Such errors include the denial of counsel , see Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U.

Nothing we have said today casts any doubt or places any qualification upon our previous holdings that limit the right to counsel of choice and recognize the authority of trial courts to establish criteria for admitting lawyers to argue before them . As the dissent too discusses , post , at 3 , the right to counsel of choice does not extend to defendants who require counsel to be appointed for them . See Wheat , 486 U. S. , at 159 ; Caplin & Drysdale , 491 U. S. , at 624 , 626 .

The Government contends , however , that the Sixth Amendment violation is not complete unless the defendant can show that substitute counsel was ineffective within the meaning of Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 , 691696 ( 1984 ) i.e . , that substitute counsels performance was deficient and the defendant was prejudiced by it . In the alternative , the Government contends that the defendant must at least demonstrate that his counsel of choice would have pursued a different strategy that would have created a reasonable probability that … the result of the proceedings would have been different, i d . , at 694in other words , that he was prejudiced within the meaning of Strickland by the denial of his counsel of choice even if substitute counsels performance was not constitutionally deficient . 1 To support these propositions , the Government points to our prior cases , which note that the right to counsel has been accorded … not for its own sake , but for the effect it has on the ability of the accused to receive a fair trial. Mickens v. Taylor , 535 U. S. 162 , 166 ( 2002 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . A trial is not unfair and thus the Sixth Amendment is not violated , the Government reasons , unless a defendant has been prejudiced .

The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0
Stated as broadly as this , the Governments argument in effect reads the Sixth Amendment as a more detailed version of the Due Process Clauseand then proceeds to give no effect to the details . It is true enough that the purpose of the rights set forth in that Amendment is to ensure a fair trial ; but it does not follow that the rights can be disregarded so long as the trial is , on the whole , fair . What the Government urges upon us here is what was urged upon us ( successfully , at one time , see Ohio v. Roberts , 448 U. S. 56 ( 1980 ) ) with regard to the Sixth Amendments right of confrontationa line of reasoning that abstracts from the right to its purposes , and then eliminates the right. Maryland v. Craig , 497 U. S. 836 , 862 ( 1990 ) ( Scalia , J. , dissenting ) . Since , it was argued , the purpose of the Confrontation Clause was to ensure the reliability of evidence , so long as the testimonial hearsay bore indicia of reliability, the Confrontation Clause was not violated . See Roberts , supra , at 6566 . We rejected that argument ( and our prior cases that had accepted it ) in Crawford v. Washington , 541 U. S. 36 ( 2004 ) , saying that the Confrontation Clause commands , not that evidence be reliable , but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner : by testing in the crucible of cross - examination. Id. , at 61 .	Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other state . And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts , records , and proceedings shall be proved , and the effect thereof . The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states . A person charged in any state with treason , felony , or other crime , who shall flee from justice , and be found in another state , shall on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled , be delivered up , to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime . No person held to service or labor in one state , under the laws thereof , escaping into another , shall , in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due . New states may be admitted by the Congress into this union ; but no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state ; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states , or parts of states , without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress . The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States ; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States , or of any particular state . The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government , and shall protect each of them against invasion ; and on application of the legislature , or of the executive ( when the legislature can not be convened ) against domestic violence .	0
So also with the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice . It commands , not that a trial be fair , but that a particular guarantee of fairness be providedto wit , that the accused be defended by the counsel he believes to be best . The Constitution guarantees a fair trial through the Due Process Clauses , but it defines the basic elements of a fair trial largely through the several provisions of the Sixth Amendment , including the Counsel Clause. Strickland , supra , at 684685 . In sum , the right at stake here is the right to counsel of choice , not the right to a fair trial ; and that right was violated because the deprivation of counsel was erroneous . No additional showing of prejudice is required to make the violation complete. 2	Done in convention by the unanimous consent of the states present the seventeenth day of September in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven and of the independence of the United States of America the twelfth .

The cases the Government relies on involve the right to the effective assistance of counsel , the violation of which generally requires a defendant to establish prejudice . See , e.g. , Strickland , supra , at 694 ; Mickens , supra , at 166 ; United States v. Cronic , 466 U. S. 648 ( 1984 ) . The earliest case generally cited for the proposition that the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel, McMann v. Richardson , 397 U. S. 759 , n. 14 ( 1970 ) , was based on the Due Process Clause rather than on the Sixth Amendment , see Powell , 287 U. S. , at 57 ( cited in e.g. , McMann , supra , at 771 , n. 14 ) . And even our recognition of the right to effective counsel within the Sixth Amendment was a consequence of our perception that representation by counsel is critical to the ability of the adversarial system to produce just results. Strickland , supra , at 685 . Having derived the right to effective representation from the purpose of ensuring a fair trial , we have , logically enough , also derived the limits of that right from that same purpose . See Mickens , supra , at 166 . The requirement that a defendant show prejudice in effective representation cases arises from the very nature of the specific element of the right to counsel at issue thereeffective ( not mistake - free ) representation . Counsel can not be ineffective unless his mistakes have harmed the defense ( or , at least , unless it is reasonably likely that they have ) . Thus , a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to effective representation is not complete until the defendant is prejudiced . See Strickland , supra , at 685 .	The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government , and shall protect each of them against invasion ; and on application of the legislature , or of the executive ( when the legislature can not be convened ) against domestic violence .	0

The actual Enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States , and within every subsequent term of ten years , in such manner as they shall by law direct .

The right to select counsel of ones choice , by contrast , has never been derived from the Sixth Amendments purpose of ensuring a fair trial . 3 It has been regarded as the root meaning of the constitutional guarantee . See Wheat , 486 U. S. , at 159 ; Andersen v. Treat , 172 U. S. 24 ( 1898 ) . See generally W. Beaney , The Right to Counsel in American Courts 1824 , 2733 ( 1955 ) . Cf . Powell , supra , at 53 . Where the right to be assisted by counsel of ones choice is wrongly denied , therefore , it is unnecessary to conduct an ineffectiveness or prejudice inquiry to establish a Sixth Amendment violation . Deprivation of the right is complete when the defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants , regardless of the quality of the representation he received . To argue otherwise is to confuse the right to counsel of choicewhich is the right to a particular lawyer regardless of comparative effectivenesswith the right to effective counselwhich imposes a baseline requirement of competence on whatever lawyer is chosen or appointed .	All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives . The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states , and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature . No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty five years , and been seven years a citizen of the United States , and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen . Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union , according to their respective numbers , which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons , including those bound to service for a term of years , and excluding Indians not taxed , three fifths of all other Persons . The actual Enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States , and within every subsequent term of ten years , in such manner as they shall by law direct . The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand , but each state shall have at least one Representative ; and until such enumeration shall be made , the state of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three , Massachusetts eight , Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one , Connecticut five , New York six , New Jersey four , Pennsylvania eight , Delaware one , Maryland six , Virginia ten , North Carolina five , South Carolina five , and Georgia three . When vacancies happen in the Representation from any state , the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies . The House of Representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers ; and shall have the sole power of impeachment . The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state , chosen by the legislature thereof , for six years ; and each Senator shall have one vote . Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election , they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes . The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen by resignation , or otherwise , during the recess of the legislature of any state , the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature , which shall then fill such vacancies . No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years , and been nine years a citizen of the United States and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen . The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate , but shall have no vote , unless they be equally divided . The Senate shall choose their other officers , and also a President pro tempore , in the absence of the Vice President , or when he shall exercise the office of President of the United States . The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments . When sitting for that purpose , they shall be on oath or affirmation . When the President of the United States is tried , the Chief Justice shall preside : And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present . Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office , and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor , trust or profit under the United States : but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment , trial , judgment and punishment , according to law . The times , places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives , shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof ; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations , except as to the places of choosing Senators . The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year , and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December , unless they shall by law appoint a different day . Each House shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members , and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business ; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day , and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members , in such manner , and under such penalties as each House may provide . Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings , punish its members for disorderly behavior , and , with the concurrence of two thirds , expel a member . Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings , and from time to time publish the same , excepting such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy ; and the yeas and nays of the members of either House on any question shall , at the desire of one fifth of those present , be entered on the journal . Neither House , during the session of Congress , shall , without the consent of the other , adjourn for more than three days , nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting . The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services , to be ascertained by law , and paid out of the treasury of the United States . They shall in all cases , except treason , felony and breach of the peace , be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same ; and for any speech or debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other place . No Senator or Representative shall , during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time : and no person holding any office under the United States , shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office . All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills .

The right to select counsel of ones choice , by contrast , has never been derived from the Sixth Amendments purpose of ensuring a fair trial . 3 It has been regarded as the root meaning of the constitutional guarantee . See Wheat , 486 U. S. , at 159 ; Andersen v. Treat , 172 U. S. 24 ( 1898 ) . See generally W. Beaney , The Right to Counsel in American Courts 1824 , 2733 ( 1955 ) . Cf . Powell , supra , at 53 . Where the right to be assisted by counsel of ones choice is wrongly denied , therefore , it is unnecessary to conduct an ineffectiveness or prejudice inquiry to establish a Sixth Amendment violation . Deprivation of the right is complete when the defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants , regardless of the quality of the representation he received . To argue otherwise is to confuse the right to counsel of choicewhich is the right to a particular lawyer regardless of comparative effectivenesswith the right to effective counselwhich imposes a baseline requirement of competence on whatever lawyer is chosen or appointed .

The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

Having concluded , in light of the Governments concession of erroneous deprivation , that the trial court violated respondents Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice , we must consider whether this error is subject to review for harmlessness . In Arizona v. Fulminante , 499 U. S. 279 ( 1991 ) , we divided constitutional errors into two classes . The first we called trial error, because the errors occurred during presentation of the case to the jury and their effect may be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether [ they were ] harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. , at 307308 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . These include most constitutional errors. Id. , at 306 . The second class of constitutional error we called structural defects. These defy analysis by harmless - error standards because they affec[t ] the framework within which the trial proceeds, and are not simply an error in the trial process itself. Id. , at 309310 . 4 See also Neder v. United States , 527 U. S. 1 , 79 ( 1999 ) . Such errors include the denial of counsel , see Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U. S. 335 ( 1963 ) , the denial of the right of self - representation , see McKaskle v. Wiggins , 465 U. S. 168 , n. 8 ( 1984 ) , the denial of the right to public trial , see Waller v. Georgia , 467 U. S. 39 , 49 , n. 9 ( 1984 ) , and the denial of the right to trial by jury by the giving of a defective reasonable - doubt instruction , see Sullivan v. Louisiana , 508 U. S. 275 ( 1993 ) .	The ratification of the conventions of nine states , shall be sufficient for the establishment of this Constitution between the states so ratifying the same .	0

Nothing we have said today casts any doubt or places any qualification upon our previous holdings that limit the right to counsel of choice and recognize the authority of trial courts to establish criteria for admitting lawyers to argue before them . As the dissent too discusses , post , at 3 , the right to counsel of choice does not extend to defendants who require counsel to be appointed for them . See Wheat , 486 U. S. , at 159 ; Caplin & Drysdale , 491 U. S. , at 624 , 626 . Nor may a defendant insist on representation by a person who is not a member of the bar , or demand that a court honor his waiver of conflict - free representation . See Wheat , 486 U. S. , at 159160 . We have recognized a trial courts wide latitude in balancing the right to counsel of choice against the needs of fairness , i d . , at 163164 , and against the demands of its calendar , Morris v. Slappy , 461 U. S. 1 , 1112 ( 1983 ) . The court has , moreover , an independent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them. Wheat , supra , at 160 . None of these limitations on the right to choose ones counsel is relevant here . This is not a case about a courts power to enforce rules or adhere to practices that determine which attorneys may appear before it , or to make scheduling and other decisions that effectively exclude a defendants first choice of counsel . However broad a courts discretion may be , the Government has conceded that the District Court here erred when it denied respondent his choice of counsel . Accepting that premise , we hold that the error violated respondents Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice and that this violation is not subject to harmless - error analysis .	The times , places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives , shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof ; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations , except as to the places of choosing Senators . The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year , and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December , unless they shall by law appoint a different day .	0

The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason , but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood , or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted .	0
So also with the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice . It commands , not that a trial be fair , but that a particular guarantee of fairness be providedto wit , that the accused be defended by the counsel he believes to be best . The Constitution guarantees a fair trial through the Due Process Clauses , but it defines the basic elements of a fair trial largely through the several provisions of the Sixth Amendment , including the Counsel Clause. Strickland , supra , at 684685 . In sum , the right at stake here is the right to counsel of choice , not the right to a fair trial ; and that right was violated because the deprivation of counsel was erroneous . No additional showing of prejudice is required to make the violation complete. 2	The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states , and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature . No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty five years , and been seven years a citizen of the United States , and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen . Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union , according to their respective numbers , which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons , including those bound to service for a term of years , and excluding Indians not taxed , three fifths of all other Persons . The actual Enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States , and within every subsequent term of ten years , in such manner as they shall by law direct . The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand , but each state shall have at least one Representative ; and until such enumeration shall be made , the state of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three , Massachusetts eight , Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one , Connecticut five , New York six , New Jersey four , Pennsylvania eight , Delaware one , Maryland six , Virginia ten , North Carolina five , South Carolina five , and Georgia three . When vacancies happen in the Representation from any state , the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies . The House of Representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers ; and shall have the sole power of impeachment .	0
The cases the Government relies on involve the right to the effective assistance of counsel , the violation of which generally requires a defendant to establish prejudice . See , e.g. , Strickland , supra , at 694 ; Mickens , supra , at 166 ; United States v. Cronic , 466 U. S. 648 ( 1984 ) . The earliest case generally cited for the proposition that the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel, McMann v. Richardson , 397 U. S. 759 , n. 14 ( 1970 ) , was based on the Due Process Clause rather than on the Sixth Amendment , see Powell , 287 U. S. , at 57 ( cited in e.g. , McMann , supra , at 771 , n. 14 ) . And even our recognition of the right to effective counsel within the Sixth Amendment was a consequence of our perception that representation by counsel is critical to the ability of the adversarial system to produce just results. Strickland , supra , at 685 . Having derived the right to effective representation from the purpose of ensuring a fair trial , we have , logically enough , also derived the limits of that right from that same purpose . See Mickens , supra , at 166 . The requirement that a defendant show prejudice in effective representation cases arises from the very nature of the specific element of the right to counsel at issue thereeffective ( not mistake - free ) representation . Counsel can not be ineffective unless his mistakes have harmed the defense ( or , at least , unless it is reasonably likely that they have ) . Thus , a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to effective representation is not complete until the defendant is prejudiced . See Strickland , supra , at 685 .	The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services , to be ascertained by law , and paid out of the treasury of the United States . They shall in all cases , except treason , felony and breach of the peace , be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same ; and for any speech or debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other place . No Senator or Representative shall , during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time : and no person holding any office under the United States , shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office .	0
The right to select counsel of ones choice , by contrast , has never been derived from the Sixth Amendments purpose of ensuring a fair trial . 3 It has been regarded as the root meaning of the constitutional guarantee . See Wheat , 486 U. S. , at 159 ; Andersen v. Treat , 172 U. S. 24 ( 1898 ) . See generally W. Beaney , The Right to Counsel in American Courts 1824 , 2733 ( 1955 ) . Cf . Powell , supra , at 53 . Where the right to be assisted by counsel of ones choice is wrongly denied , therefore , it is unnecessary to conduct an ineffectiveness or prejudice inquiry to establish a Sixth Amendment violation . Deprivation of the right is complete when the defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants , regardless of the quality of the representation he received . To argue otherwise is to confuse the right to counsel of choicewhich is the right to a particular lawyer regardless of comparative effectivenesswith the right to effective counselwhich imposes a baseline requirement of competence on whatever lawyer is chosen or appointed .	Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other state . And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts , records , and proceedings shall be proved , and the effect thereof .	0

Having concluded , in light of the Governments concession of erroneous deprivation , that the trial court violated respondents Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice , we must consider whether this error is subject to review for harmlessness . In Arizona v. Fulminante , 499 U. S. 279 ( 1991 ) , we divided constitutional errors into two classes . The first we called trial error, because the errors occurred during presentation of the case to the jury and their effect may be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether [ they were ] harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. , at 307308 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . These include most constitutional errors. Id. , at 306 . The second class of constitutional error we called structural defects. These defy analysis by harmless - error standards because they affec[t ] the framework within which the trial proceeds, and are not simply an error in the trial process itself. Id. , at 309310 . 4 See also Neder v. United States , 527 U. S. 1 , 79 ( 1999 ) . Such errors include the denial of counsel , see Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U. S. 335 ( 1963 ) , the denial of the right of self - representation , see McKaskle v. Wiggins , 465 U. S. 168 , n. 8 ( 1984 ) , the denial of the right to public trial , see Waller v. Georgia , 467 U. S. 39 , 49 , n. 9 ( 1984 ) , and the denial of the right to trial by jury by the giving of a defective reasonable - doubt instruction , see Sullivan v. Louisiana , 508 U. S. 275 ( 1993 ) .	The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state , elected by the people thereof , for six years ; and each Senator shall have one vote . The electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislatures . When vacancies happen in the representation of any state in the Senate , the executive authority of such state shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies : Provided , that the legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct .

Nothing we have said today casts any doubt or places any qualification upon our previous holdings that limit the right to counsel of choice and recognize the authority of trial courts to establish criteria for admitting lawyers to argue before them . As the dissent too discusses , post , at 3 , the right to counsel of choice does not extend to defendants who require counsel to be appointed for them . See Wheat , 486 U. S. , at 159 ; Caplin & Drysdale , 491 U. S. , at 624 , 626 . Nor may a defendant insist on representation by a person who is not a member of the bar , or demand that a court honor his waiver of conflict - free representation . See Wheat , 486 U. S. , at 159160 . We have recognized a trial courts wide latitude in balancing the right to counsel of choice against the needs of fairness , i d . , at 163164 , and against the demands of its calendar , Morris v. Slappy , 461 U. S. 1 , 1112 ( 1983 ) . The court has , moreover , an independent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them. Wheat , supra , at 160 . None of these limitations on the right to choose ones counsel is relevant here . This is not a case about a courts power to enforce rules or adhere to practices that determine which attorneys may appear before it , or to make scheduling and other decisions that effectively exclude a defendants first choice of counsel . However broad a courts discretion may be , the Government has conceded that the District Court here erred when it denied respondent his choice of counsel .

The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them .

Under the majoritys holding , some defendants will be awarded new trials even though it is clear that the erroneous disqualification of their first - choice counsel did not prejudice them in the least . Suppose , for example , that a defendant is initially represented by an attorney who previously represented the defendant in civil matters and who has little criminal experience . Suppose that this attorney is erroneously disqualified and that the defendant is then able to secure the services of a nationally acclaimed and highly experienced criminal defense attorney who secures a surprisingly favorable result at trialfor instance , acquittal on most but not all counts . Under the majoritys holding , the trial courts erroneous ruling automatically means that the Sixth Amendment was violatedeven if the defendant makes no attempt to argue that the disqualified attorney would have done a better job . In fact , the defendant would still be entitled to a new trial on the counts of conviction even if the defendant publicly proclaimed after the verdict that the second attorney had provided better representation than any other attorney in the country could have possibly done .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	1

I disagree with the Courts conclusion that a criminal conviction must automatically be reversed whenever a trial court errs in applying its rules regarding pro hac vice admissions and as a result prevents a defendant from being represented at trial by the defendants first - choice attorney . Instead , a defendant should be required to make at least some showing that the trial courts erroneous ruling adversely affected the quality of assistance that the defendant received . In my view , the majoritys contrary holding is based on an incorrect interpretation of the Sixth Amendment and a misapplication of harmless - error principles . I respectfully dissent .	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

Because the Sixth Amendment focuses on the quality of the assistance that counsel of choice would have provided , I would hold that the erroneous disqualification of counsel does not violate the Sixth Amendment unless the ruling diminishes the quality of assistance that the defendant would have otherwise received . This would not require a defendant to show that the second - choice attorney was constitutionally ineffective within the meaning of Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 ( 1984 ) .

The consequences of the majoritys holding are particularly severe in the federal system and in other court systems that do not allow a defendant to take an interlocutory appeal when counsel is disqualified . See Flanagan v. United States , 465 U. S. 259 , 260 ( 1984 ) . Under such systems , appellate review typically occurs after the defendant has been tried and convicted . At that point , if an appellate court concludes that the trial judge made a marginally incorrect ruling in applying its own pro hac vice rules , the appellate court has no alternative but to order a new trialeven if there is not even any claim of prejudice . The Sixth Amendment does not require such results .	Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other state .

Because I believe that some showing of prejudice is required to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment , I would vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether there was prejudice . However , assuming for the sake of argument that no prejudice is required , I believe that such a violation , like most constitutional violations , is amenable to harmless - error review . Our statutes demand it , and our precedents do not bar it . I would then vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether the error was harmless in this case .	No law , varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives , shall take effect , until an election of Representatives shall have intervened .	0

The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America .

But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President .

I disagree with the Courts conclusion that a criminal conviction must automatically be reversed whenever a trial court errs in applying its rules regarding pro hac vice admissions and as a result prevents a defendant from being represented at trial by the defendants first - choice attorney . Instead , a defendant should be required to make at least some showing that the trial courts erroneous ruling adversely affected the quality of assistance that the defendant received . In my view , the majoritys contrary holding is based on an incorrect interpretation of the Sixth Amendment and a misapplication of harmless - error principles . I respectfully dissent .	In suits at common law , where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars , the right of trial by jury shall be preserved , and no fact tried by a jury , shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States , than according to the rules of the common law .	0

The majority makes a subtle but important mistake at the outset in its characterization of what the Sixth Amendment guarantees . The majority states that the Sixth Amendment protects the right of a defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. Ante , at 3 . What the Sixth Amendment actually protects , however , is the right to have the assistance that the defendants counsel of choice is able to provide . It follows that if the erroneous disqualification of a defendants counsel of choice does not impair the assistance that a defendant receives at trial , there is no violation of the Sixth Amendment . 1	A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed .	0

Because the Sixth Amendment focuses on the quality of the assistance that counsel of choice would have provided , I would hold that the erroneous disqualification of counsel does not violate the Sixth Amendment unless the ruling diminishes the quality of assistance that the defendant would have otherwise received . This would not require a defendant to show that the second - choice attorney was constitutionally ineffective within the meaning of Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 ( 1984 ) .

But even accepting , as the majority holds , that the erroneous disqualification of counsel of choice always violates the Sixth Amendment , it still would not follow that reversal is required in all cases . The Constitution , by its terms , does not mandate any particular remedy for violations of its own provisions . Instead , we are bound in this case by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a ) , which instructs federal courts to disregar[d] [a]ny error … which does not affect substantial rights. See also 28 U. S. C. § 2111 ; Chapman v. California , 386 U. S. 18 , 22 ( 1967 ) . The only exceptions we have recognized to this rule have been for a limited class of fundamental constitutional errors that defy analysis by harmless error standards.  Neder v. United States , 527 U. S. 1 , 7 ( 1999 ) ( quoting Arizona v. Fulminante , 499 U. S. 279 , 309 ( 1991 ) ) ; see also Chapman , supra , at 23 . Such errors … necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair [ and ] deprive defendants of basic protections without which a criminal trial can not reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence … and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.  Neder , supra , at 89 ( quoting Rose v.

The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President .

He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .

Because I believe that some showing of prejudice is required to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment , I would vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether there was prejudice . However , assuming for the sake of argument that no prejudice is required , I believe that such a violation , like most constitutional violations , is amenable to harmless - error review .

I disagree with the Courts conclusion that a criminal conviction must automatically be reversed whenever a trial court errs in applying its rules regarding pro hac vice admissions and as a result prevents a defendant from being represented at trial by the defendants first - choice attorney . Instead , a defendant should be required to make at least some showing that the trial courts erroneous ruling adversely affected the quality of assistance that the defendant received . In my view , the majoritys contrary holding is based on an incorrect interpretation of the Sixth Amendment and a misapplication of harmless - error principles . I respectfully dissent .

If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law .

The majority makes a subtle but important mistake at the outset in its characterization of what the Sixth Amendment guarantees . The majority states that the Sixth Amendment protects the right of a defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. Ante , at 3 . What the Sixth Amendment actually protects , however , is the right to have the assistance that the defendants counsel of choice is able to provide . It follows that if the erroneous disqualification of a defendants counsel of choice does not impair the assistance that a defendant receives at trial , there is no violation of the Sixth Amendment . 1	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	0

But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof .

The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen by resignation , or otherwise , during the recess of the legislature of any state , the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature , which shall then fill such vacancies .

The language of the Sixth Amendment supports this interpretation . The Assistance of Counsel Clause focuses on what a defendant is entitled to receive ( Assistance ) , rather than on the identity of the provider . The background of the adoption of the Sixth Amendment points in the same direction .

Because the Sixth Amendment focuses on the quality of the assistance that counsel of choice would have provided , I would hold that the erroneous disqualification of counsel does not violate the Sixth Amendment unless the ruling diminishes the quality of assistance that the defendant would have otherwise received . This would not require a defendant to show that the second - choice attorney was constitutionally ineffective within the meaning of Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 ( 1984 ) . Rather , the defendant would be entitled to a new trial if the defendant could show an identifiable difference in the quality of representation between the disqualified counsel and the attorney who represents the defendant at trial. Rodriguez v.

Under the majoritys holding , some defendants will be awarded new trials even though it is clear that the erroneous disqualification of their first - choice counsel did not prejudice them in the least . Suppose , for example , that a defendant is initially represented by an attorney who previously represented the defendant in civil matters and who has little criminal experience . Suppose that this attorney is erroneously disqualified and that the defendant is then able to secure the services of a nationally acclaimed and highly experienced criminal defense attorney who secures a surprisingly favorable result at trialfor instance , acquittal on most but not all counts . Under the majoritys holding , the trial courts erroneous ruling automatically means that the Sixth Amendment was violatedeven if the defendant makes no attempt to argue that the disqualified attorney would have done a better job . In fact , the defendant would still be entitled to a new trial on the counts of conviction even if the defendant publicly proclaimed after the verdict that the second attorney had provided better representation than any other attorney in the country could have possibly done .	The District constituting the seat of government of the United States shall appoint in such manner as the Congress may direct : A number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a state , but in no event more than the least populous state ; they shall be in addition to those appointed by the states , but they shall be considered , for the purposes of the election of President and Vice President , to be electors appointed by a state ; and they shall meet in the District and perform such duties as provided by the twelfth article of amendment .

The consequences of the majoritys holding are particularly severe in the federal system and in other court systems that do not allow a defendant to take an interlocutory appeal when counsel is disqualified . See Flanagan v. United States , 465 U. S. 259 , 260 ( 1984 ) . Under such systems , appellate review typically occurs after the defendant has been tried and convicted . At that point , if an appellate court concludes that the trial judge made a marginally incorrect ruling in applying its own pro hac vice rules , the appellate court has no alternative but to order a new trialeven if there is not even any claim of prejudice . The Sixth Amendment does not require such results .	Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the United States , or any place subject to their jurisdiction .

Because I believe that some showing of prejudice is required to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment , I would vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether there was prejudice . However , assuming for the sake of argument that no prejudice is required , I believe that such a violation , like most constitutional violations , is amenable to harmless - error review .

I disagree with the Courts conclusion that a criminal conviction must automatically be reversed whenever a trial court errs in applying its rules regarding pro hac vice admissions and as a result prevents a defendant from being represented at trial by the defendants first - choice attorney . Instead , a defendant should be required to make at least some showing that the trial courts erroneous ruling adversely affected the quality of assistance that the defendant received .

Because the Sixth Amendment focuses on the quality of the assistance that counsel of choice would have provided , I would hold that the erroneous disqualification of counsel does not violate the Sixth Amendment unless the ruling diminishes the quality of assistance that the defendant would have otherwise received .

The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

Under the majoritys holding , some defendants will be awarded new trials even though it is clear that the erroneous disqualification of their first - choice counsel did not prejudice them in the least .

The consequences of the majoritys holding are particularly severe in the federal system and in other court systems that do not allow a defendant to take an interlocutory appeal when counsel is disqualified . See Flanagan v. United States , 465 U. S. 259 , 260 ( 1984 ) . Under such systems , appellate review typically occurs after the defendant has been tried and convicted . At that point , if an appellate court concludes that the trial judge made a marginally incorrect ruling in applying its own pro hac vice rules , the appellate court has no alternative but to order a new trialeven if there is not even any claim of prejudice . The Sixth Amendment does not require such results .	The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services , to be ascertained by law , and paid out of the treasury of the United States . They shall in all cases , except treason , felony and breach of the peace , be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same ; and for any speech or debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other place .

Because I believe that some showing of prejudice is required to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment , I would vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether there was prejudice . However , assuming for the sake of argument that no prejudice is required , I believe that such a violation , like most constitutional violations , is amenable to harmless - error review .

I disagree with the Courts conclusion that a criminal conviction must automatically be reversed whenever a trial court errs in applying its rules regarding pro hac vice admissions and as a result prevents a defendant from being represented at trial by the defendants first - choice attorney . Instead , a defendant should be required to make at least some showing that the trial courts erroneous ruling adversely affected the quality of assistance that the defendant received .

The majority makes a subtle but important mistake at the outset in its characterization of what the Sixth Amendment guarantees . The majority states that the Sixth Amendment protects the right of a defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. Ante , at 3 . What the Sixth Amendment actually protects , however , is the right to have the assistance that the defendants counsel of choice is able to provide . It follows that if the erroneous disqualification of a defendants counsel of choice does not impair the assistance that a defendant receives at trial , there is no violation of the Sixth Amendment . 1	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

The Senators and Representatives before mentioned , and the members of the several state legislatures , and all executive and judicial officers , both of the United States and of the several states , shall be bound by oath or affirmation , to support this Constitution ; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States .	0

Because the Sixth Amendment focuses on the quality of the assistance that counsel of choice would have provided , I would hold that the erroneous disqualification of counsel does not violate the Sixth Amendment unless the ruling diminishes the quality of assistance that the defendant would have otherwise received . This would not require a defendant to show that the second - choice attorney was constitutionally ineffective within the meaning of Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 ( 1984 ) . Rather , the defendant would be entitled to a new trial if the defendant could show an identifiable difference in the quality of representation between the disqualified counsel and the attorney who represents the defendant at trial. Rodriguez v. Chandler , 382 F. 3d 670 , 675 ( CA7 2004 ) , cert . denied , 543 U. S. 1156 ( 2005 ) .

Under the majoritys holding , a defendant who is erroneously required to go to trial with a second - choice attorney is automatically entitled to a new trial even if this attorney performed brilliantly . By contrast , a defendant whose attorney was ineffective in the constitutional sense ( i.e. , made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed … by the Sixth Amendment, Strickland , 466 U. S. , at 687 ) can not obtain relief without showing prejudice .	The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session .	0

No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia , when in actual service in time of war or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation .	0
Under the majoritys holding , some defendants will be awarded new trials even though it is clear that the erroneous disqualification of their first - choice counsel did not prejudice them in the least . Suppose , for example , that a defendant is initially represented by an attorney who previously represented the defendant in civil matters and who has little criminal experience . Suppose that this attorney is erroneously disqualified and that the defendant is then able to secure the services of a nationally acclaimed and highly experienced criminal defense attorney who secures a surprisingly favorable result at trialfor instance , acquittal on most but not all counts . Under the majoritys holding , the trial courts erroneous ruling automatically means that the Sixth Amendment was violatedeven if the defendant makes no attempt to argue that the disqualified attorney would have done a better job . In fact , the defendant would still be entitled to a new trial on the counts of conviction even if the defendant publicly proclaimed after the verdict that the second attorney had provided better representation than any other attorney in the country could have possibly done .	No soldier shall , in time of peace be quartered in any house , without the consent of the owner , nor in time of war , but in a manner to be prescribed by law .	0

All debts contracted and engagements entered into , before the adoption of this Constitution , shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution , as under the Confederation . This Constitution , and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof ; and all treaties made , or which shall be made , under the authority of the United States , shall be the supreme law of the land ; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby , anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding . The Senators and Representatives before mentioned , and the members of the several state legislatures , and all executive and judicial officers , both of the United States and of the several states , shall be bound by oath or affirmation , to support this Constitution ; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States .	0
The consequences of the majoritys holding are particularly severe in the federal system and in other court systems that do not allow a defendant to take an interlocutory appeal when counsel is disqualified . See Flanagan v. United States , 465 U. S. 259 , 260 ( 1984 ) . Under such systems , appellate review typically occurs after the defendant has been tried and convicted . At that point , if an appellate court concludes that the trial judge made a marginally incorrect ruling in applying its own pro hac vice rules , the appellate court has no alternative but to order a new trialeven if there is not even any claim of prejudice . The Sixth Amendment does not require such results .	New states may be admitted by the Congress into this union ; but no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state ; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states , or parts of states , without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress . The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States ; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States , or of any particular state .	0
Because I believe that some showing of prejudice is required to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment , I would vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether there was prejudice . However , assuming for the sake of argument that no prejudice is required , I believe that such a violation , like most constitutional violations , is amenable to harmless - error review . Our statutes demand it , and our precedents do not bar it . I would then vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether the error was harmless in this case .	Each House shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members , and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business ; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day , and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members , in such manner , and under such penalties as each House may provide . Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings , punish its members for disorderly behavior , and , with the concurrence of two thirds , expel a member . Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings , and from time to time publish the same , excepting such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy ; and the yeas and nays of the members of either House on any question shall , at the desire of one fifth of those present , be entered on the journal . Neither House , during the session of Congress , shall , without the consent of the other , adjourn for more than three days , nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting .	0
I disagree with the Courts conclusion that a criminal conviction must automatically be reversed whenever a trial court errs in applying its rules regarding pro hac vice admissions and as a result prevents a defendant from being represented at trial by the defendants first - choice attorney . Instead , a defendant should be required to make at least some showing that the trial courts erroneous ruling adversely affected the quality of assistance that the defendant received . In my view , the majoritys contrary holding is based on an incorrect interpretation of the Sixth Amendment and a misapplication of harmless - error principles . I respectfully dissent .	The right of citizens of the United States , who are 18 years of age or older , to vote , shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of age .

The majority makes a subtle but important mistake at the outset in its characterization of what the Sixth Amendment guarantees . The majority states that the Sixth Amendment protects the right of a defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. Ante , at 3 . What the Sixth Amendment actually protects , however , is the right to have the assistance that the defendants counsel of choice is able to provide . It follows that if the erroneous disqualification of a defendants counsel of choice does not impair the assistance that a defendant receives at trial , there is no violation of the Sixth Amendment . 1	No state shall enter into any treaty , alliance , or confederation ; grant letters of marque and reprisal ; coin money ; emit bills of credit ; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts ; pass any bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or law impairing the obligation of contracts , or grant any title of nobility . No state shall , without the consent of the Congress , lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports , except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it 's inspection laws : and the net produce of all duties and imposts , laid by any state on imports or exports , shall be for the use of the treasury of the United States ; and all such laws shall be subject to the revision and control of the Congress . No state shall , without the consent of Congress , lay any duty of tonnage , keep troops , or ships of war in time of peace , enter into any agreement or compact with another state , or with a foreign power , or engage in war , unless actually invaded , or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay .	0

This approach is fully consistent with our prior decisions . We have never held that the erroneous disqualification of counsel violates the Sixth Amendment when there is no prejudice , and while we have stated in several cases that the Sixth Amendment protects a defendants right to counsel of choice , see Caplin & Drysdale , Chartered v.

Nor do our opinions in those cases refer to that question . It is therefore unreasonable to read our general statements regarding counsel of choice as addressing the issue of prejudice . 3	No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia , when in actual service in time of war or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation .	0

But even accepting , as the majority holds , that the erroneous disqualification of counsel of choice always violates the Sixth Amendment , it still would not follow that reversal is required in all cases .

The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

Under the majoritys holding , a defendant who is erroneously required to go to trial with a second - choice attorney is automatically entitled to a new trial even if this attorney performed brilliantly . By contrast , a defendant whose attorney was ineffective in the constitutional sense ( i.e. , made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed … by the Sixth Amendment, Strickland , 466 U. S. , at 687 ) can not obtain relief without showing prejudice .	New states may be admitted by the Congress into this union ; but no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state ; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states , or parts of states , without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress .

But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof .

Under the majoritys holding , some defendants will be awarded new trials even though it is clear that the erroneous disqualification of their first - choice counsel did not prejudice them in the least . Suppose , for example , that a defendant is initially represented by an attorney who previously represented the defendant in civil matters and who has little criminal experience . Suppose that this attorney is erroneously disqualified and that the defendant is then able to secure the services of a nationally acclaimed and highly experienced criminal defense attorney who secures a surprisingly favorable result at trialfor instance , acquittal on most but not all counts . Under the majoritys holding , the trial courts erroneous ruling automatically means that the Sixth Amendment was violatedeven if the defendant makes no attempt to argue that the disqualified attorney would have done a better job . In fact , the defendant would still be entitled to a new trial on the counts of conviction even if the defendant publicly proclaimed after the verdict that the second attorney had provided better representation than any other attorney in the country could have possibly done .	He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .	0

The consequences of the majoritys holding are particularly severe in the federal system and in other court systems that do not allow a defendant to take an interlocutory appeal when counsel is disqualified . See Flanagan v. United States , 465 U. S. 259 , 260 ( 1984 ) . Under such systems , appellate review typically occurs after the defendant has been tried and convicted . At that point , if an appellate court concludes that the trial judge made a marginally incorrect ruling in applying its own pro hac vice rules , the appellate court has no alternative but to order a new trialeven if there is not even any claim of prejudice . The Sixth Amendment does not require such results .	The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January , and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January , of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified ; and the terms of their successors shall then begin . The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year , and such meeting shall begin at noon on the 3d day of January , unless they shall by law appoint a different day .

If a President shall not have been chosen before the time fixed for the beginning of his term , or if the President elect shall have failed to qualify , then the Vice President elect shall act as President until a President shall have qualified ; and the Congress may by law provide for the case wherein neither a President elect nor a Vice President elect shall have qualified , declaring who shall then act as President , or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected , and such person shall act accordingly until a President or Vice President shall have qualified . The Congress may by law provide for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the House of Representatives may choose a President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them , and for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the Senate may choose a Vice President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them .

Because I believe that some showing of prejudice is required to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment , I would vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether there was prejudice . However , assuming for the sake of argument that no prejudice is required , I believe that such a violation , like most constitutional violations , is amenable to harmless - error review . Our statutes demand it , and our precedents do not bar it . I would then vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether the error was harmless in this case .	He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .	0
I disagree with the Courts conclusion that a criminal conviction must automatically be reversed whenever a trial court errs in applying its rules regarding pro hac vice admissions and as a result prevents a defendant from being represented at trial by the defendants first - choice attorney . Instead , a defendant should be required to make at least some showing that the trial courts erroneous ruling adversely affected the quality of assistance that the defendant received . In my view , the majoritys contrary holding is based on an incorrect interpretation of the Sixth Amendment and a misapplication of harmless - error principles . I respectfully dissent .	The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state , elected by the people thereof , for six years ; and each Senator shall have one vote . The electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislatures . When vacancies happen in the representation of any state in the Senate , the executive authority of such state shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies : Provided , that the legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct . This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution .	0

The majority makes a subtle but important mistake at the outset in its characterization of what the Sixth Amendment guarantees . The majority states that the Sixth Amendment protects the right of a defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. Ante , at 3 . What the Sixth Amendment actually protects , however , is the right to have the assistance that the defendants counsel of choice is able to provide . It follows that if the erroneous disqualification of a defendants counsel of choice does not impair the assistance that a defendant receives at trial , there is no violation of the Sixth Amendment . 1	The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude .

The language of the Sixth Amendment supports this interpretation .

Because the Sixth Amendment focuses on the quality of the assistance that counsel of choice would have provided , I would hold that the erroneous disqualification of counsel does not violate the Sixth Amendment unless the ruling diminishes the quality of assistance that the defendant would have otherwise received . This would not require a defendant to show that the second - choice attorney was constitutionally ineffective within the meaning of Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 ( 1984 ) . Rather , the defendant would be entitled to a new trial if the defendant could show an identifiable difference in the quality of representation between the disqualified counsel and the attorney who represents the defendant at trial. Rodriguez v.

But even accepting , as the majority holds , that the erroneous disqualification of counsel of choice always violates the Sixth Amendment , it still would not follow that reversal is required in all cases . The Constitution , by its terms , does not mandate any particular remedy for violations of its own provisions . Instead , we are bound in this case by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a ) , which instructs federal courts to disregar[d] [a]ny error … which does not affect substantial rights. See also 28 U.

Under the majoritys holding , a defendant who is erroneously required to go to trial with a second - choice attorney is automatically entitled to a new trial even if this attorney performed brilliantly .

If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law .

The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen by resignation , or otherwise , during the recess of the legislature of any state , the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature , which shall then fill such vacancies . No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years , and been nine years a citizen of the United States and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen .

The Senate shall choose their other officers , and also a President pro tempore , in the absence of the Vice President , or when he shall exercise the office of President of the United States . The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments . When sitting for that purpose , they shall be on oath or affirmation . When the President of the United States is tried , the Chief Justice shall preside : And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present .

Under the majoritys holding , a defendant who is erroneously required to go to trial with a second - choice attorney is automatically entitled to a new trial even if this attorney performed brilliantly . By contrast , a defendant whose attorney was ineffective in the constitutional sense ( i.e. , made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed … by the Sixth Amendment, Strickland , 466 U.

The right of citizens of the United States , who are 18 years of age or older , to vote , shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of age . The Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation .	0
Under the majoritys holding , some defendants will be awarded new trials even though it is clear that the erroneous disqualification of their first - choice counsel did not prejudice them in the least . Suppose , for example , that a defendant is initially represented by an attorney who previously represented the defendant in civil matters and who has little criminal experience . Suppose that this attorney is erroneously disqualified and that the defendant is then able to secure the services of a nationally acclaimed and highly experienced criminal defense attorney who secures a surprisingly favorable result at trialfor instance , acquittal on most but not all counts . Under the majoritys holding , the trial courts erroneous ruling automatically means that the Sixth Amendment was violatedeven if the defendant makes no attempt to argue that the disqualified attorney would have done a better job . In fact , the defendant would still be entitled to a new trial on the counts of conviction even if the defendant publicly proclaimed after the verdict that the second attorney had provided better representation than any other attorney in the country could have possibly done .	The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people .	0

The Congress , whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary , shall propose amendments to this Constitution , or , on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states , shall call a convention for proposing amendments , which , in either case , shall be valid to all intents and purposes , as part of this Constitution , when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states , or by conventions in three fourths thereof , as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress ; provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article ; and that no state , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate .	0
The consequences of the majoritys holding are particularly severe in the federal system and in other court systems that do not allow a defendant to take an interlocutory appeal when counsel is disqualified . See Flanagan v. United States , 465 U. S. 259 , 260 ( 1984 ) . Under such systems , appellate review typically occurs after the defendant has been tried and convicted . At that point , if an appellate court concludes that the trial judge made a marginally incorrect ruling in applying its own pro hac vice rules , the appellate court has no alternative but to order a new trialeven if there is not even any claim of prejudice . The Sixth Amendment does not require such results .	The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states . A person charged in any state with treason , felony , or other crime , who shall flee from justice , and be found in another state , shall on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled , be delivered up , to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime . No person held to service or labor in one state , under the laws thereof , escaping into another , shall , in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due .	0

Our statutes demand it , and our precedents do not bar it . I would then vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether the error was harmless in this case .

I disagree with the Courts conclusion that a criminal conviction must automatically be reversed whenever a trial court errs in applying its rules regarding pro hac vice admissions and as a result prevents a defendant from being represented at trial by the defendants first - choice attorney . Instead , a defendant should be required to make at least some showing that the trial courts erroneous ruling adversely affected the quality of assistance that the defendant received . In my view , the majoritys contrary holding is based on an incorrect interpretation of the Sixth Amendment and a misapplication of harmless - error principles . I respectfully dissent .

The majority makes a subtle but important mistake at the outset in its characterization of what the Sixth Amendment guarantees . The majority states that the Sixth Amendment protects the right of a defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. Ante , at 3 . What the Sixth Amendment actually protects , however , is the right to have the assistance that the defendants counsel of choice is able to provide . It follows that if the erroneous disqualification of a defendants counsel of choice does not impair the assistance that a defendant receives at trial , there is no violation of the Sixth Amendment . 1	All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives .	0
The language of the Sixth Amendment supports this interpretation . The Assistance of Counsel Clause focuses on what a defendant is entitled to receive ( Assistance ) , rather than on the identity of the provider . The background of the adoption of the Sixth Amendment points in the same direction . The specific evil against which the Assistance of Counsel Clause was aimed was the English common - law rule severely limiting a felony defendants ability to be assisted by counsel . United States v. Ash , 413 U. S. 300 , 306 ( 1973 ) . [T]he core purpose of the counsel guarantee was to assure Assistance at trial, i d . , at 309 , and thereby to assure fairness in the adversary criminal process, United States v. Morrison , 449 U. S. 361 , 364 ( 1981 ) . It was not the essential aim of the Amendment … to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be represented by the lawyer whom he prefers. Wheat v. United States , 486 U. S. 153 , 159 ( 1988 ) ; cf . Morris v. Slappy , 461 U. S. 1 , 14 ( 1983 ) ( [W]e reject the claim that the Sixth Amendment guarantees a meaningful relationship between an accused and his counsel ) .	The judicial power of the United States , shall be vested in one Supreme Court , and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish . The judges , both of the supreme and inferior courts , shall hold their offices during good behaviour , and shall , at stated times , receive for their services , a compensation , which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office . The judicial power shall extend to all cases , in law and equity , arising under this Constitution , the laws of the United States , and treaties made , or which shall be made , under their authority ;-- to all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls ;-- to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ;-- to controversies to which the United States shall be a party ;-- to controversies between two or more states ;-- between a state and citizens of another state ;-- between citizens of different states ;-- between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states , and between a state , or the citizens thereof , and foreign states , citizens or subjects . In all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , and those in which a state shall be party , the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction . In all the other cases before mentioned , the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction , both as to law and fact , with such exceptions , and under such regulations as the Congress shall make . The trial of all crimes , except in cases of impeachment , shall be by jury ; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed ; but when not committed within any state , the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed . Treason against the United States , shall consist only in levying war against them , or in adhering to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort . No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act , or on confession in open court .

Because the Sixth Amendment focuses on the quality of the assistance that counsel of choice would have provided , I would hold that the erroneous disqualification of counsel does not violate the Sixth Amendment unless the ruling diminishes the quality of assistance that the defendant would have otherwise received . This would not require a defendant to show that the second - choice attorney was constitutionally ineffective within the meaning of Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 ( 1984 ) . Rather , the defendant would be entitled to a new trial if the defendant could show an identifiable difference in the quality of representation between the disqualified counsel and the attorney who represents the defendant at trial. Rodriguez v. Chandler , 382 F. 3d 670 , 675 ( CA7 2004 ) , cert . denied , 543 U. S. 1156 ( 2005 ) .	The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states .

No person held to service or labor in one state , under the laws thereof , escaping into another , shall , in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due .	0
This approach is fully consistent with our prior decisions . We have never held that the erroneous disqualification of counsel violates the Sixth Amendment when there is no prejudice , and while we have stated in several cases that the Sixth Amendment protects a defendants right to counsel of choice , see Caplin & Drysdale , Chartered v. United States , 491 U. S. 617 , 624625 ( 1989 ) ; Wheat , supra , at 159 ; Powell v. Alabama , 287 U. S. 45 , 53 ( 1932 ) , we had no occasion in those cases to consider whether a violation of this right can be shown where there is no prejudice . Nor do our opinions in those cases refer to that question . It is therefore unreasonable to read our general statements regarding counsel of choice as addressing the issue of prejudice . 3	The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services , to be ascertained by law , and paid out of the treasury of the United States . They shall in all cases , except treason , felony and breach of the peace , be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same ; and for any speech or debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other place . No Senator or Representative shall , during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time : and no person holding any office under the United States , shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office .	0
But even accepting , as the majority holds , that the erroneous disqualification of counsel of choice always violates the Sixth Amendment , it still would not follow that reversal is required in all cases . The Constitution , by its terms , does not mandate any particular remedy for violations of its own provisions . Instead , we are bound in this case by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a ) , which instructs federal courts to disregar[d] [a]ny error … which does not affect substantial rights. See also 28 U. S. C. § 2111 ; Chapman v. California , 386 U. S. 18 , 22 ( 1967 ) . The only exceptions we have recognized to this rule have been for a limited class of fundamental constitutional errors that defy analysis by harmless error standards.  Neder v. United States , 527 U. S. 1 , 7 ( 1999 ) ( quoting Arizona v. Fulminante , 499 U. S. 279 , 309 ( 1991 ) ) ; see also Chapman , supra , at 23 . Such errors … necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair [ and ] deprive defendants of basic protections without which a criminal trial can not reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence … and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.  Neder , supra , at 89 ( quoting Rose v.

Under the majoritys holding , some defendants will be awarded new trials even though it is clear that the erroneous disqualification of their first - choice counsel did not prejudice them in the least . Suppose , for example , that a defendant is initially represented by an attorney who previously represented the defendant in civil matters and who has little criminal experience . Suppose that this attorney is erroneously disqualified and that the defendant is then able to secure the services of a nationally acclaimed and highly experienced criminal defense attorney who secures a surprisingly favorable result at trialfor instance , acquittal on most but not all counts . Under the majoritys holding , the trial courts erroneous ruling automatically means that the Sixth Amendment was violatedeven if the defendant makes no attempt to argue that the disqualified attorney would have done a better job . In fact , the defendant would still be entitled to a new trial on the counts of conviction even if the defendant publicly proclaimed after the verdict that the second attorney had provided better representation than any other attorney in the country could have possibly done .	All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives .	0
The consequences of the majoritys holding are particularly severe in the federal system and in other court systems that do not allow a defendant to take an interlocutory appeal when counsel is disqualified . See Flanagan v. United States , 465 U. S. 259 , 260 ( 1984 ) . Under such systems , appellate review typically occurs after the defendant has been tried and convicted . At that point , if an appellate court concludes that the trial judge made a marginally incorrect ruling in applying its own pro hac vice rules , the appellate court has no alternative but to order a new trialeven if there is not even any claim of prejudice . The Sixth Amendment does not require such results .	No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice , and no person who has held the office of President , or acted as President , for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once . But this article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this article was proposed by the Congress , and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President , or acting as President , during the term within which this article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term . This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three - fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states by the Congress .	0
Because I believe that some showing of prejudice is required to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment , I would vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether there was prejudice . However , assuming for the sake of argument that no prejudice is required , I believe that such a violation , like most constitutional violations , is amenable to harmless - error review . Our statutes demand it , and our precedents do not bar it . I would then vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether the error was harmless in this case .	The Congress , whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary , shall propose amendments to this Constitution , or , on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states , shall call a convention for proposing amendments , which , in either case , shall be valid to all intents and purposes , as part of this Constitution , when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states , or by conventions in three fourths thereof , as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress ; provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article ; and that no state , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate .	0

The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0
I disagree with the Courts conclusion that a criminal conviction must automatically be reversed whenever a trial court errs in applying its rules regarding pro hac vice admissions and as a result prevents a defendant from being represented at trial by the defendants first - choice attorney . Instead , a defendant should be required to make at least some showing that the trial courts erroneous ruling adversely affected the quality of assistance that the defendant received . In my view , the majoritys contrary holding is based on an incorrect interpretation of the Sixth Amendment and a misapplication of harmless - error principles . I respectfully dissent .	Treason against the United States , shall consist only in levying war against them , or in adhering to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort . No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act , or on confession in open court . The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason , but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood , or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted .	0

The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen by resignation , or otherwise , during the recess of the legislature of any state , the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature , which shall then fill such vacancies . No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years , and been nine years a citizen of the United States and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen . The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate , but shall have no vote , unless they be equally divided . The Senate shall choose their other officers , and also a President pro tempore , in the absence of the Vice President , or when he shall exercise the office of President of the United States . The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments . When sitting for that purpose , they shall be on oath or affirmation .

If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law .

Because the Sixth Amendment focuses on the quality of the assistance that counsel of choice would have provided , I would hold that the erroneous disqualification of counsel does not violate the Sixth Amendment unless the ruling diminishes the quality of assistance that the defendant would have otherwise received . This would not require a defendant to show that the second - choice attorney was constitutionally ineffective within the meaning of Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 ( 1984 ) . Rather , the defendant would be entitled to a new trial if the defendant could show an identifiable difference in the quality of representation between the disqualified counsel and the attorney who represents the defendant at trial. Rodriguez v. Chandler , 382 F. 3d 670 , 675 ( CA7 2004 ) , cert . denied , 543 U. S. 1156 ( 2005 ) .	The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises , to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States ; but all duties , imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States ; To borrow money on the credit of the United States ; To regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several states , and with the Indian tribes ; To establish a uniform rule of naturalization , and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States ; To coin money , regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin , and fix the standard of weights and measures ; To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States ; To establish post offices and post roads ; To promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries ; To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court ; To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas , and offenses against the law of nations ; To declare war , grant letters of marque and reprisal , and make rules concerning captures on land and water ; To raise and support armies , but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years ; To provide and maintain a navy ; To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces ; To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union , suppress insurrections and repel invasions ; To provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining , the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , reserving to the states respectively , the appointment of the officers , and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress ; To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten miles square ) as may , by cession of particular states , and the acceptance of Congress , become the seat of the government of the United States , and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be , for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , dockyards , and other needful buildings ;-- And To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof .	0
This approach is fully consistent with our prior decisions . We have never held that the erroneous disqualification of counsel violates the Sixth Amendment when there is no prejudice , and while we have stated in several cases that the Sixth Amendment protects a defendants right to counsel of choice , see Caplin & Drysdale , Chartered v. United States , 491 U. S. 617 , 624625 ( 1989 ) ; Wheat , supra , at 159 ; Powell v. Alabama , 287 U. S. 45 , 53 ( 1932 ) , we had no occasion in those cases to consider whether a violation of this right can be shown where there is no prejudice . Nor do our opinions in those cases refer to that question . It is therefore unreasonable to read our general statements regarding counsel of choice as addressing the issue of prejudice . 3	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	0
But even accepting , as the majority holds , that the erroneous disqualification of counsel of choice always violates the Sixth Amendment , it still would not follow that reversal is required in all cases . The Constitution , by its terms , does not mandate any particular remedy for violations of its own provisions . Instead , we are bound in this case by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a ) , which instructs federal courts to disregar[d] [a]ny error … which does not affect substantial rights. See also 28 U. S. C. § 2111 ; Chapman v. California , 386 U. S. 18 , 22 ( 1967 ) . The only exceptions we have recognized to this rule have been for a limited class of fundamental constitutional errors that defy analysis by harmless error standards.  Neder v. United States , 527 U. S. 1 , 7 ( 1999 ) ( quoting Arizona v. Fulminante , 499 U. S. 279 , 309 ( 1991 ) ) ; see also Chapman , supra , at 23 . Such errors … necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair [ and ] deprive defendants of basic protections without which a criminal trial can not reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence … and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.  Neder , supra , at 89 ( quoting Rose v. Clark , 478 U. S. 570 , 577578 ( 1986 ) ( second omission in original ) ) ; see also ante , at 9 ( listing such errors ) .

Under the majoritys holding , a defendant who is erroneously required to go to trial with a second - choice attorney is automatically entitled to a new trial even if this attorney performed brilliantly . By contrast , a defendant whose attorney was ineffective in the constitutional sense ( i.e. , made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed … by the Sixth Amendment, Strickland , 466 U. S. , at 687 ) can not obtain relief without showing prejudice .	After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture , sale , or transportation of intoxicating liquors within , the importation thereof into , or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited .

Under the majoritys holding , some defendants will be awarded new trials even though it is clear that the erroneous disqualification of their first - choice counsel did not prejudice them in the least . Suppose , for example , that a defendant is initially represented by an attorney who previously represented the defendant in civil matters and who has little criminal experience . Suppose that this attorney is erroneously disqualified and that the defendant is then able to secure the services of a nationally acclaimed and highly experienced criminal defense attorney who secures a surprisingly favorable result at trialfor instance , acquittal on most but not all counts . Under the majoritys holding , the trial courts erroneous ruling automatically means that the Sixth Amendment was violatedeven if the defendant makes no attempt to argue that the disqualified attorney would have done a better job . In fact , the defendant would still be entitled to a new trial on the counts of conviction even if the defendant publicly proclaimed after the verdict that the second attorney had provided better representation than any other attorney in the country could have possibly done .	Each House shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members , and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business ; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day , and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members , in such manner , and under such penalties as each House may provide .

The consequences of the majoritys holding are particularly severe in the federal system and in other court systems that do not allow a defendant to take an interlocutory appeal when counsel is disqualified . See Flanagan v. United States , 465 U. S. 259 , 260 ( 1984 ) . Under such systems , appellate review typically occurs after the defendant has been tried and convicted . At that point , if an appellate court concludes that the trial judge made a marginally incorrect ruling in applying its own pro hac vice rules , the appellate court has no alternative but to order a new trialeven if there is not even any claim of prejudice . The Sixth Amendment does not require such results .	The eighteenth article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed .

Because I believe that some showing of prejudice is required to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment , I would vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether there was prejudice .

The majority makes a subtle but important mistake at the outset in its characterization of what the Sixth Amendment guarantees . The majority states that the Sixth Amendment protects the right of a defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. Ante , at 3 . What the Sixth Amendment actually protects , however , is the right to have the assistance that the defendants counsel of choice is able to provide . It follows that if the erroneous disqualification of a defendants counsel of choice does not impair the assistance that a defendant receives at trial , there is no violation of the Sixth Amendment . 1	No law , varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives , shall take effect , until an election of Representatives shall have intervened .	0

What the Sixth Amendment actually protects , however , is the right to have the assistance that the defendants counsel of choice is able to provide . It follows that if the erroneous disqualification of a defendants counsel of choice does not impair the assistance that a defendant receives at trial , there is no violation of the Sixth Amendment . 1	Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other state . And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts , records , and proceedings shall be proved , and the effect thereof .	0

The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States ; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States , or of any particular state .	0
The language of the Sixth Amendment supports this interpretation . The Assistance of Counsel Clause focuses on what a defendant is entitled to receive ( Assistance ) , rather than on the identity of the provider . The background of the adoption of the Sixth Amendment points in the same direction . The specific evil against which the Assistance of Counsel Clause was aimed was the English common - law rule severely limiting a felony defendants ability to be assisted by counsel . United States v. Ash , 413 U. S. 300 , 306 ( 1973 ) . [T]he core purpose of the counsel guarantee was to assure Assistance at trial, i d . , at 309 , and thereby to assure fairness in the adversary criminal process, United States v. Morrison , 449 U. S. 361 , 364 ( 1981 ) . It was not the essential aim of the Amendment … to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be represented by the lawyer whom he prefers. Wheat v. United States , 486 U. S. 153 , 159 ( 1988 ) ; cf . Morris v. Slappy , 461 U. S. 1 , 14 ( 1983 ) ( [W]e reject the claim that the Sixth Amendment guarantees a meaningful relationship between an accused and his counsel ) .	The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state , elected by the people thereof , for six years ; and each Senator shall have one vote . The electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislatures . When vacancies happen in the representation of any state in the Senate , the executive authority of such state shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies : Provided , that the legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct . This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution .	0
Because the Sixth Amendment focuses on the quality of the assistance that counsel of choice would have provided , I would hold that the erroneous disqualification of counsel does not violate the Sixth Amendment unless the ruling diminishes the quality of assistance that the defendant would have otherwise received . This would not require a defendant to show that the second - choice attorney was constitutionally ineffective within the meaning of Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 ( 1984 ) . Rather , the defendant would be entitled to a new trial if the defendant could show an identifiable difference in the quality of representation between the disqualified counsel and the attorney who represents the defendant at trial. Rodriguez v. Chandler , 382 F. 3d 670 , 675 ( CA7 2004 ) , cert . denied , 543 U. S. 1156 ( 2005 ) .	The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services , to be ascertained by law , and paid out of the treasury of the United States . They shall in all cases , except treason , felony and breach of the peace , be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same ; and for any speech or debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other place . No Senator or Representative shall , during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time : and no person holding any office under the United States , shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office .	0
This approach is fully consistent with our prior decisions . We have never held that the erroneous disqualification of counsel violates the Sixth Amendment when there is no prejudice , and while we have stated in several cases that the Sixth Amendment protects a defendants right to counsel of choice , see Caplin & Drysdale , Chartered v. United States , 491 U. S. 617 , 624625 ( 1989 ) ; Wheat , supra , at 159 ; Powell v. Alabama , 287 U. S. 45 , 53 ( 1932 ) , we had no occasion in those cases to consider whether a violation of this right can be shown where there is no prejudice . Nor do our opinions in those cases refer to that question . It is therefore unreasonable to read our general statements regarding counsel of choice as addressing the issue of prejudice . 3	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each state , excluding Indians not taxed . But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof . But Congress may by a vote of two - thirds of each House , remove such disability . The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law , including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion , shall not be questioned . But neither the United States nor any state shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States , or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave ; but all such debts , obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void . The Congress shall have power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article .	0
But even accepting , as the majority holds , that the erroneous disqualification of counsel of choice always violates the Sixth Amendment , it still would not follow that reversal is required in all cases . The Constitution , by its terms , does not mandate any particular remedy for violations of its own provisions . Instead , we are bound in this case by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a ) , which instructs federal courts to disregar[d] [a]ny error … which does not affect substantial rights. See also 28 U. S. C. § 2111 ; Chapman v. California , 386 U. S. 18 , 22 ( 1967 ) . The only exceptions we have recognized to this rule have been for a limited class of fundamental constitutional errors that defy analysis by harmless error standards.  Neder v. United States , 527 U. S. 1 , 7 ( 1999 ) ( quoting Arizona v. Fulminante , 499 U. S. 279 , 309 ( 1991 ) ) ; see also Chapman , supra , at 23 . Such errors … necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair [ and ] deprive defendants of basic protections without which a criminal trial can not reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence … and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.  Neder , supra , at 89 ( quoting Rose v. Clark , 478 U. S. 570 , 577578 ( 1986 ) ( second omission in original ) ) ; see also ante , at 9 ( listing such errors ) .	The times , places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives , shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof ; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations , except as to the places of choosing Senators . The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year , and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December , unless they shall by law appoint a different day .	0

Under the majoritys holding , a defendant who is erroneously required to go to trial with a second - choice attorney is automatically entitled to a new trial even if this attorney performed brilliantly .

The consequences of the majoritys holding are particularly severe in the federal system and in other court systems that do not allow a defendant to take an interlocutory appeal when counsel is disqualified .

Because I believe that some showing of prejudice is required to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment , I would vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether there was prejudice .

United States , 486 U. S. 153 , 159 ( 1988 ) ; cf . Morris v. Slappy , 461 U.

Because the Sixth Amendment focuses on the quality of the assistance that counsel of choice would have provided , I would hold that the erroneous disqualification of counsel does not violate the Sixth Amendment unless the ruling diminishes the quality of assistance that the defendant would have otherwise received . This would not require a defendant to show that the second - choice attorney was constitutionally ineffective within the meaning of Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 ( 1984 ) . Rather , the defendant would be entitled to a new trial if the defendant could show an identifiable difference in the quality of representation between the disqualified counsel and the attorney who represents the defendant at trial. Rodriguez v. Chandler , 382 F. 3d 670 , 675 ( CA7 2004 ) , cert . denied , 543 U. S. 1156 ( 2005 ) .

This approach is fully consistent with our prior decisions . We have never held that the erroneous disqualification of counsel violates the Sixth Amendment when there is no prejudice , and while we have stated in several cases that the Sixth Amendment protects a defendants right to counsel of choice , see Caplin & Drysdale , Chartered v. United States , 491 U. S. 617 , 624625 ( 1989 ) ; Wheat , supra , at 159 ; Powell v. Alabama , 287 U. S. 45 , 53 ( 1932 ) , we had no occasion in those cases to consider whether a violation of this right can be shown where there is no prejudice . Nor do our opinions in those cases refer to that question . It is therefore unreasonable to read our general statements regarding counsel of choice as addressing the issue of prejudice . 3	Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other state . And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts , records , and proceedings shall be proved , and the effect thereof . The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states . A person charged in any state with treason , felony , or other crime , who shall flee from justice , and be found in another state , shall on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled , be delivered up , to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime . No person held to service or labor in one state , under the laws thereof , escaping into another , shall , in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due . New states may be admitted by the Congress into this union ; but no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state ; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states , or parts of states , without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress . The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States ; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States , or of any particular state . The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government , and shall protect each of them against invasion ; and on application of the legislature , or of the executive ( when the legislature can not be convened ) against domestic violence .	0
But even accepting , as the majority holds , that the erroneous disqualification of counsel of choice always violates the Sixth Amendment , it still would not follow that reversal is required in all cases . The Constitution , by its terms , does not mandate any particular remedy for violations of its own provisions . Instead , we are bound in this case by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a ) , which instructs federal courts to disregar[d] [a]ny error … which does not affect substantial rights. See also 28 U. S. C. § 2111 ; Chapman v. California , 386 U. S. 18 , 22 ( 1967 ) . The only exceptions we have recognized to this rule have been for a limited class of fundamental constitutional errors that defy analysis by harmless error standards.  Neder v. United States , 527 U. S. 1 , 7 ( 1999 ) ( quoting Arizona v. Fulminante , 499 U. S. 279 , 309 ( 1991 ) ) ; see also Chapman , supra , at 23 . Such errors … necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair [ and ] deprive defendants of basic protections without which a criminal trial can not reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence … and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.  Neder , supra , at 89 ( quoting Rose v. Clark , 478 U. S. 570 , 577578 ( 1986 ) ( second omission in original ) ) ; see also ante , at 9 ( listing such errors ) .

All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives . The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states , and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature . No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty five years , and been seven years a citizen of the United States , and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen . Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union , according to their respective numbers , which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons , including those bound to service for a term of years , and excluding Indians not taxed , three fifths of all other Persons . The actual Enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States , and within every subsequent term of ten years , in such manner as they shall by law direct .

When vacancies happen in the Representation from any state , the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies . The House of Representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers ; and shall have the sole power of impeachment . The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state , chosen by the legislature thereof , for six years ; and each Senator shall have one vote . Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election , they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes . The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen by resignation , or otherwise , during the recess of the legislature of any state , the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature , which shall then fill such vacancies . No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years , and been nine years a citizen of the United States and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen . The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate , but shall have no vote , unless they be equally divided . The Senate shall choose their other officers , and also a President pro tempore , in the absence of the Vice President , or when he shall exercise the office of President of the United States . The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments . When sitting for that purpose , they shall be on oath or affirmation . When the President of the United States is tried , the Chief Justice shall preside : And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present . Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office , and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor , trust or profit under the United States : but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment , trial , judgment and punishment , according to law . The times , places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives , shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof ; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations , except as to the places of choosing Senators . The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year , and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December , unless they shall by law appoint a different day . Each House shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members , and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business ; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day , and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members , in such manner , and under such penalties as each House may provide . Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings , punish its members for disorderly behavior , and , with the concurrence of two thirds , expel a member . Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings , and from time to time publish the same , excepting such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy ; and the yeas and nays of the members of either House on any question shall , at the desire of one fifth of those present , be entered on the journal . Neither House , during the session of Congress , shall , without the consent of the other , adjourn for more than three days , nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting . The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services , to be ascertained by law , and paid out of the treasury of the United States . They shall in all cases , except treason , felony and breach of the peace , be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same ; and for any speech or debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other place . No Senator or Representative shall , during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time : and no person holding any office under the United States , shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office . All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it become a law , be presented to the President of the United States ; if he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it . If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law . But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays , and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively . If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall have been presented to him , the same shall be a law , in like manner as if he had signed it , unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return , in which case it shall not be a law . Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill .

Under the majoritys holding , a defendant who is erroneously required to go to trial with a second - choice attorney is automatically entitled to a new trial even if this attorney performed brilliantly . By contrast , a defendant whose attorney was ineffective in the constitutional sense ( i.e. , made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed … by the Sixth Amendment, Strickland , 466 U. S. , at 687 ) can not obtain relief without showing prejudice .

Under the majoritys holding , some defendants will be awarded new trials even though it is clear that the erroneous disqualification of their first - choice counsel did not prejudice them in the least . Suppose , for example , that a defendant is initially represented by an attorney who previously represented the defendant in civil matters and who has little criminal experience .

In fact , the defendant would still be entitled to a new trial on the counts of conviction even if the defendant publicly proclaimed after the verdict that the second attorney had provided better representation than any other attorney in the country could have possibly done .

The consequences of the majoritys holding are particularly severe in the federal system and in other court systems that do not allow a defendant to take an interlocutory appeal when counsel is disqualified . See Flanagan v. United States , 465 U. S. 259 , 260 ( 1984 ) . Under such systems , appellate review typically occurs after the defendant has been tried and convicted . At that point , if an appellate court concludes that the trial judge made a marginally incorrect ruling in applying its own pro hac vice rules , the appellate court has no alternative but to order a new trialeven if there is not even any claim of prejudice . The Sixth Amendment does not require such results .	He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .	0

Because I believe that some showing of prejudice is required to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment , I would vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether there was prejudice . However , assuming for the sake of argument that no prejudice is required , I believe that such a violation , like most constitutional violations , is amenable to harmless - error review . Our statutes demand it , and our precedents do not bar it . I would then vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether the error was harmless in this case .

The right to a fair trial , guaranteed to state criminal defendants by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment , imposes on States certain duties consistent with their sovereign obligation to ensure that justice shall be done  in all criminal prosecutions .

S. 83 ( 1963 ) , we held that when a State suppresses evidence favorable to an accused that is material to guilt or to punishment , the State violates the defendants right to due process , irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution. Id. , at 87 .

The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States .

Almost 50 years ago , this Court declared that citizens do not surrender their First Amendment rights by accepting public employment . Rather , the First Amendment protection of a public employee ’s speech depends on a careful balance “ between the interests of the [ employee ] , as a citizen , in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State , as an employer , in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees . ” Pickering v. Board of Ed . of Township High School Dist . 205 , Will Cty . , 391 U. S. 563 , 568 ( 1968 ) . In Pickering , the Court struck the balance in favor of the public employee , extending First Amendment protection to a teacher who was fired after writing a letter to the editor of a local newspaper criticizing the school board that employed him . Today , we consider whether the First Amendment similarly protects a public employee who provided truthful sworn testimony , compelled by sub - poena , outside the course of his ordinary job responsibilities .

The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate .

The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

There is no evidence , for example , that Lane ’s testimony at Schmitz’ trials was false or erroneous or that Lane unnecessarily disclosed any sensitive , confidential , or privileged information while testifying . 5 In these circumstances , we conclude that Lane ’s speech is entitled to protection under the First Amendment . The Eleventh Circuit erred in holding otherwise and dismissing Lane ’s claim of retaliation on that basis .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	1

Respondent Franks argues that even if Lane ’s testimony is protected under the First Amendment , the claims against him in his individual capacity should be dismissed on the basis of qualified immunity . We agree .	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

Lane argues that two other Eleventh Circuit precedents put Franks on notice that his conduct violated the First Amendment : Martinez v. Opa - Locka , 971 F. 2d 708 ( 1992 ) ( per curiam ) , and Tindal v. Montgomery Cty . Comm’n , 32 F. 3d 1535 ( 1994 ) . Martinez involved a public employee ’s subpoenaed testimony before the Opa - Locka City Commission regarding her employer ’s procurement practices . 971 F. 2d , at 710 . The Eleventh Circuit held that her speech was protected , reasoning that it addressed a matter of public concern and that her interest in speaking freely was not outweighed by her employer ’s interest in providing government services . Id. , at 712 . It held , further , that the relevant constitutional rules were so clearly established at the time that qualified immunity did not apply . Id. , at 713 . Tindal , decided two years after Martinez , involved a public employee ’s subpoenaed testimony in her co - worker ’s sexual harassment lawsuit . 32 F. 3d , at 1537–1538 . The court again ruled in favor of the em - ployee . It held that the employee ’s speech touched upona public concern and that her employer had not offered any evidence that the speech hindered operations . Id.,at 1539–1540 .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	1

Morris , Martinez , and Tindal represent the landscape of Eleventh Circuit precedent the parties rely on for qualified immunity purposes . If Martinez and Tindal were controlling in the Eleventh Circuit in 2009 , we would agree with Lane that Franks could not reasonably have believed that it was lawful to fire Lane in retaliation for his testimony . But both cases must be read together with Morris , which reasoned — in declining to afford First Amendment protection — that the plaintiff ’s decision to testify was motivated solely by his desire to comply with a subpoena . The same could be said of Lane ’s decision to testify . Franks was thus entitled to rely on Morris when he fired Lane . 6	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	1

Lane argues that Morris is inapplicable because it distinguished Martinez , suggesting that Martinez survived Morris . See Morris , 142 F. 3d , at 1382–1383 . But this debate over whether Martinez or Morris applies to Lane ’s claim only highlights the dispositive point : At the time of Lane ’s termination , Eleventh Circuit precedent did not provide clear notice that subpoenaed testimony concerning information acquired through public employment is speech of a citizen entitled to First Amendment protection . At best , Lane can demonstrate only a discrepancy in Eleventh Circuit precedent , which is insufficient to defeat the defense of qualified immunity .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	1

And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0
Finally , Lane argues that decisions of the Third and Seventh Circuits put Franks on notice that his firing of Lane was unconstitutional . See Reilly , 532 F. 3d , at 231 ( CA3 ) ( truthful testimony in court is citizen speech protected by the First Amendment ) ; Morales v. Jones , 494 F. 3d 590 , 598 ( CA7 2007 ) ( similar ) . But , as the court below acknowledged , those precedents were in direct conflict with Eleventh Circuit precedent . See 523 Fed . Appx . , at 712 , n. 3 .	The electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for President and Vice - President , one of whom , at least , shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves ; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President , and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice - President , and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President , and of all persons voted for as Vice - President , and of the number of votes for each , which lists they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate ;-- The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted ;-- the person having the greatest number of votes for President , shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if no person have such majority , then from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President , the House of Representatives shall choose immediately , by ballot , the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by states , the representation from each state having one vote ; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two - thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . And if the House of Representatives shall not choose a President whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them , before the fourth day of March next following , then the Vice - President shall act as President , as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President . The person having the greatest number of votes as Vice - President , shall be the Vice - President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed , and if no person have a majority , then from the two highest numbers on the list , the Senate shall choose the Vice - President ; a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two - thirds of the whole number of Senators , and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice . But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice - President of the United States .	0

Lane ’s speech is entitled to First Amendment protection , but because respondent Franks is entitled to qualified immunity , we affirm the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit as to the claims against Franks in his individual capacity . Our decision does not resolve , however , the claims against Burrow — initially brought against Franks when he served as President of CACC — in her official capacity . Although the District Court dismissed those claims for prospective relief as barred by the Eleventh Amendment , the Eleventh Circuit declined to consider that question on appeal , see 523 Fed . Appx . , at 711 ( “ Because Lane has failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation , we do not decide about Franks’ defense of sovereign immunity ” ) , and the parties have not asked us to consider it now .

This case presents the discrete question whether a public employee speaks “ as a citizen on a matter of public concern , ” Garcetti v. Ceballos , 547 U.

Respondent paraplegics filed this action for damages and equitable relief , alleging that Tennessee and a number of its counties had denied them physical access to that States courts in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ( ADA ) , which provides : [N]o qualified individual with a disability shall , by reason of such disability , be excluded from participation or denied the benefits of the services , programs or activities of a public entity, 42 U. S. C. § 12132 . After the District Court denied the States motion to dismiss on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds , the Sixth Circuit held the appeal in abeyance pending Board of Trustees of Univ . of Ala. v. Garrett , 531 U. S. 356 . This Court later ruled in Garrett that the Eleventh Amendment bars private money damages actions for state violations of ADA Title I , which prohibits employment discrimination against the disabled . The en banc Sixth Circuit then issued its Popovich decision , in which it interpreted Garrett to bar private ADA suits against States based on equal protection principles , but not those relying on due process , and therefore permitted a Title II damages action to proceed despite the States immunity claim . Thereafter , a Sixth Circuit panel affirmed the dismissal denial in this case , explaining that respondents claims were not barred because they were based on due process principles . In response to a rehearing petition arguing that Popovich did not control because respondents complaint did not allege due process violations , the panel filed an amended opinion , explaining that due process protects the right of access to the courts , and that the evidence before Congress when it enacted Title II established , inter alia , that physical barriers in courthouses and courtrooms have had the effect of denying disabled people the opportunity for such access .	The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state , or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state .	1

( 1 ) The Boerne inquirys first step requires identification of the constitutional rights Congress sought to enforce when it enacted Title II . Garrett , 531 U. S. , at 365 . Like Title I , Title II seeks to enforce the Fourteenth Amendments prohibition on irrational disability discrimination , Garrett , 531 U. S. , at 366 .

Whether Title II validly enforces such constitutional rights is a question that must be judged with reference to the historical experience which it reflects. E.g. , South Carolina v.

Congress enacted Title II against a backdrop of pervasive unequal treatment of persons with disabilities in the administration of state services and programs , including systematic deprivations of fundamental rights . The historical experience that Title II reflects is also documented in the decisions of this and other courts , which have identified unconstitutional treatment of disabled persons by state agencies in a variety of public programs and services . With respect to the particular services at issue , Congress learned that many individuals , in many States , were being excluded from courthouses and court proceedings by reason of their disabilities . A Civil Rights Commission report before Congress showed that some 76 % of public services and programs housed in state - owned buildings were inaccessible to and unusable by such persons . Congress also heard testimony from those persons describing the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses . And its appointed task force heard numerous examples of their exclusion from state judicial services and programs , including failure to make courtrooms accessible to witnesses with physical disabilities .

In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

Accordingly , Title II can only be understood as a congressional attempt to rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment law laid down by this Court, rather than a legitimate effort to remedy or prevent state violations of that Amendment . Garrett , supra , at 374 . 9	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	0
The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts . This conclusion gains even more support when Title IIs nonexistent record of constitutional violations is compared with legislation that we have sustained as valid § 5 enforcement legislation .

Thus , as with Title I in Garrett , the Patent Remedy Act in Florida Prepaid , the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 in Kimel , and the RFRA in City of Boerne , all of which we invalidated as attempts to substantively redefine the Fourteenth Amendment , it is unlikely that many of the [ state actions ] affected by [ Title II ] ha[ve ] any likelihood of being unconstitutional. City of Boerne , supra , at 532 . Viewed as a whole , then , there is little doubt that Title II of the ADA does not validly abrogate state sovereign immunity . 10	All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives .	0
The majority concludes that Title IIs massive overbreadth can be cured by considering the statute only as it applies to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of judicial services. Ante , at 20 ( citing United States v. Raines , 362 U. S. 17 , 26 ( 1960 ) ) . I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the § 5 context . While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case , the proper inquiry under City of Boerne and its progeny is somewhat different . In applying the congruence - and - proportionality test , we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment . This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy .	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each state , excluding Indians not taxed . But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof . But Congress may by a vote of two - thirds of each House , remove such disability . The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law , including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion , shall not be questioned . But neither the United States nor any state shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States , or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave ; but all such debts , obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void . The Congress shall have power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article .	1

In Board of Trustees of Univ . of Ala. v. Garrett , 531 U.

Today , the Court concludes that Title II of that Act , § § 1213112165 , does validly abrogate that immunity , at least insofar as it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts. Ante , at 19 .

In Garrett , we conducted the three - step inquiry first enunciated in City of Boerne to determine whether Title I of the ADA satisfied the congruence - and - proportionality test .

Even if it were proper to consider this broader category of evidence , much of it does not concern unconstitutional action by the States . The bulk of the Courts evidence concerns discrimination by nonstate governments , rather than the States themselves . 2 We have repeatedly held that such evidence is irrelevant to the inquiry whether Congress has validly abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity , a privilege enjoyed only by the sovereign States .

The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts .

The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment .

The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0
In Board of Trustees of Univ . of Ala. v. Garrett , 531 U. S. 356 ( 2001 ) , we held that Congress did not validly abrogate States Eleventh Amendment immunity when it enacted Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ( ADA ) , 42 U. S. C. § § 1211112117 . Today , the Court concludes that Title II of that Act , § § 1213112165 , does validly abrogate that immunity , at least insofar as it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts. Ante , at 19 . Because todays decision is irreconcilable with Garrett and the well - established principles it embodies , I dissent .	The times , places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives , shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof ; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations , except as to the places of choosing Senators . The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year , and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December , unless they shall by law appoint a different day .	0
The Eleventh Amendment bars private lawsuits in federal court against an unconsenting State . E.g. , Nevada Dept . of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U. S. 721 , 726 ( 2003 ) ; Garrett , supra , at 363 ; Kimel v. Florida Bd . of Regents , 528 U. S. 62 , 73 ( 2000 ) . Congress may overcome States sovereign immunity and authorize such suits only if it unmistakably expresses its intent to do so , and only if it acts pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Hibbs , supra , at 726 . While the Court correctly holds that Congress satisfied the first prerequisite , ante , at 6 , I disagree with its conclusion that Title II is valid § 5 enforcement legislation .	Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted .	0

In Garrett , we conducted the three - step inquiry first enunciated in City of Boerne to determine whether Title I of the ADA satisfied the congruence - and - proportionality test . A faithful application of that test to Title II reveals that it too  substantively redefine[s],  rather than permissibly enforces , the rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment . Hibbs , supra , at 728 .	He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .	0
Even if it were proper to consider this broader category of evidence , much of it does not concern unconstitutional action by the States . The bulk of the Courts evidence concerns discrimination by nonstate governments , rather than the States themselves . 2 We have repeatedly held that such evidence is irrelevant to the inquiry whether Congress has validly abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity , a privilege enjoyed only by the sovereign States . Garrett , supra , at 368369 ; Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed . Expense Bd . v. College Savings Bank , 527 U. S. 627 , 640 ( 1999 ) ; Kimel , 528 U. S. , at 89 . Moreover , the majority today cites the same congressional task force evidence we rejected in Garrett . Ante , at 15 ( citing Garrett , supra , at 379 ( Breyer , J. , dissenting ) , and 531 U. S. , at 391424 ( App . C to opinion of Breyer , J. , dissenting ) ( chronicling instances of unequal treatment in the administration of public programs ) ) . As in Garrett , this unexamined , anecdotal evidence does not suffice . 531 U. S. , at 370 . Most of the brief anecdotes do not involve States at all , and those that do are not sufficiently detailed to determine whether the instances of unequal treatment were irrational , and thus unconstitutional under our decision in Cleburne . Garrett , supra , at 370371 . Therefore , even outside the access to the courts context , the Court identifies few , if any , constitutional violations perpetrated by the States against disabled persons . 3	Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted .	0
The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts . This conclusion gains even more support when Title IIs nonexistent record of constitutional violations is compared with legislation that we have sustained as valid § 5 enforcement legislation . See , e.g. , Hibbs , 538 U. S. , at 729732 ( tracing the extensive legislative record documenting States gender discrimination in employment leave policies ) ; South Carolina v. Katzenbach , 383 U. S. 301 , 312313 ( 1966 ) ( same with respect to racial discrimination in voting rights ) . Accordingly , Title II can only be understood as a congressional attempt to rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment law laid down by this Court, rather than a legitimate effort to remedy or prevent state violations of that Amendment . Garrett , supra , at 374 . 9	No law , varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives , shall take effect , until an election of Representatives shall have intervened .	0

No person held to service or labor in one state , under the laws thereof , escaping into another , shall , in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due .

Despite subjecting States to this expansive liability, the broad terms of Title II d[o ] nothing to limit the coverage of the Act to cases involving arguable constitutional violations. Florida Prepaid , 527 U.

But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them .

In Board of Trustees of Univ . of Ala. v. Garrett , 531 U.

C. § § 1211112117 . Today , the Court concludes that Title II of that Act , § § 1213112165 , does validly abrogate that immunity , at least insofar as it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts. Ante , at 19 . Because todays decision is irreconcilable with Garrett and the well - established principles it embodies , I dissent .	All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it become a law , be presented to the President of the United States ; if he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it . If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law . But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays , and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively . If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall have been presented to him , the same shall be a law , in like manner as if he had signed it , unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return , in which case it shall not be a law . Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill .	0

The Eleventh Amendment bars private lawsuits in federal court against an unconsenting State . E.g. , Nevada Dept . of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U.

The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0
Even if it were proper to consider this broader category of evidence , much of it does not concern unconstitutional action by the States .

I fear that the Courts adoption of an as - applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft § 5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations . Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute , such as Title II , may be enforced against the States . All the while , States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their Eleventh Amendment rights . The majoritys as - applied approach simply can not be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary .

In Board of Trustees of Univ . of Ala. v. Garrett , 531 U.

C. § § 1211112117 . Today , the Court concludes that Title II of that Act , § § 1213112165 , does validly abrogate that immunity , at least insofar as it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts. Ante , at 19 . Because todays decision is irreconcilable with Garrett and the well - established principles it embodies , I dissent .	The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises , to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States ; but all duties , imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States ; To borrow money on the credit of the United States ; To regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several states , and with the Indian tribes ; To establish a uniform rule of naturalization , and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States ; To coin money , regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin , and fix the standard of weights and measures ; To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States ; To establish post offices and post roads ; To promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries ; To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court ; To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas , and offenses against the law of nations ; To declare war , grant letters of marque and reprisal , and make rules concerning captures on land and water ; To raise and support armies , but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years ; To provide and maintain a navy ; To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces ; To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union , suppress insurrections and repel invasions ; To provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining , the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , reserving to the states respectively , the appointment of the officers , and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress ; To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten miles square ) as may , by cession of particular states , and the acceptance of Congress , become the seat of the government of the United States , and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be , for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , dockyards , and other needful buildings ;-- And To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof .	0

Even if it were proper to consider this broader category of evidence , much of it does not concern unconstitutional action by the States . The bulk of the Courts evidence concerns discrimination by nonstate governments , rather than the States themselves . 2 We have repeatedly held that such evidence is irrelevant to the inquiry whether Congress has validly abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity , a privilege enjoyed only by the sovereign States .

Therefore , even outside the access to the courts context , the Court identifies few , if any , constitutional violations perpetrated by the States against disabled persons . 3	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0

Therefore , even outside the access to the courts context , the Court identifies few , if any , constitutional violations perpetrated by the States against disabled persons . 3	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	0
The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts . This conclusion gains even more support when Title IIs nonexistent record of constitutional violations is compared with legislation that we have sustained as valid § 5 enforcement legislation . See , e.g. , Hibbs , 538 U. S. , at 729732 ( tracing the extensive legislative record documenting States gender discrimination in employment leave policies ) ; South Carolina v. Katzenbach , 383 U. S. 301 , 312313 ( 1966 ) ( same with respect to racial discrimination in voting rights ) . Accordingly , Title II can only be understood as a congressional attempt to rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment law laid down by this Court, rather than a legitimate effort to remedy or prevent state violations of that Amendment . Garrett , supra , at 374 . 9	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector .

Thus , as with Title I in Garrett , the Patent Remedy Act in Florida Prepaid , the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 in Kimel , and the RFRA in City of Boerne , all of which we invalidated as attempts to substantively redefine the Fourteenth Amendment , it is unlikely that many of the [ state actions ] affected by [ Title II ] ha[ve ] any likelihood of being unconstitutional. City of Boerne , supra , at 532 . Viewed as a whole , then , there is little doubt that Title II of the ADA does not validly abrogate state sovereign immunity . 10	No state shall enter into any treaty , alliance , or confederation ; grant letters of marque and reprisal ; coin money ; emit bills of credit ; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts ; pass any bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or law impairing the obligation of contracts , or grant any title of nobility . No state shall , without the consent of the Congress , lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports , except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it 's inspection laws : and the net produce of all duties and imposts , laid by any state on imports or exports , shall be for the use of the treasury of the United States ; and all such laws shall be subject to the revision and control of the Congress . No state shall , without the consent of Congress , lay any duty of tonnage , keep troops , or ships of war in time of peace , enter into any agreement or compact with another state , or with a foreign power , or engage in war , unless actually invaded , or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay .	0
The majority concludes that Title IIs massive overbreadth can be cured by considering the statute only as it applies to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of judicial services. Ante , at 20 ( citing United States v. Raines , 362 U. S. 17 , 26 ( 1960 ) ) . I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the § 5 context . While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case , the proper inquiry under City of Boerne and its progeny is somewhat different . In applying the congruence - and - proportionality test , we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment . This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy .	The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states , and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature . No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty five years , and been seven years a citizen of the United States , and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen . Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union , according to their respective numbers , which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons , including those bound to service for a term of years , and excluding Indians not taxed , three fifths of all other Persons . The actual Enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States , and within every subsequent term of ten years , in such manner as they shall by law direct . The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand , but each state shall have at least one Representative ; and until such enumeration shall be made , the state of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three , Massachusetts eight , Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one , Connecticut five , New York six , New Jersey four , Pennsylvania eight , Delaware one , Maryland six , Virginia ten , North Carolina five , South Carolina five , and Georgia three . When vacancies happen in the Representation from any state , the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies . The House of Representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers ; and shall have the sole power of impeachment .	0

The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session .	0
I fear that the Courts adoption of an as - applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft § 5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations . Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute , such as Title II , may be enforced against the States . All the while , States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their Eleventh Amendment rights . The majoritys as - applied approach simply can not be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary .	No state shall enter into any treaty , alliance , or confederation ; grant letters of marque and reprisal ; coin money ; emit bills of credit ; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts ; pass any bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or law impairing the obligation of contracts , or grant any title of nobility .

In Board of Trustees of Univ . of Ala. v. Garrett , 531 U. S. 356 ( 2001 ) , we held that Congress did not validly abrogate States Eleventh Amendment immunity when it enacted Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ( ADA ) , 42 U. S. C. § § 1211112117 . Today , the Court concludes that Title II of that Act , § § 1213112165 , does validly abrogate that immunity , at least insofar as it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts. Ante , at 19 . Because todays decision is irreconcilable with Garrett and the well - established principles it embodies , I dissent .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	0
The Eleventh Amendment bars private lawsuits in federal court against an unconsenting State . E.g. , Nevada Dept . of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U. S. 721 , 726 ( 2003 ) ; Garrett , supra , at 363 ; Kimel v. Florida Bd . of Regents , 528 U. S. 62 , 73 ( 2000 ) . Congress may overcome States sovereign immunity and authorize such suits only if it unmistakably expresses its intent to do so , and only if it acts pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Hibbs , supra , at 726 . While the Court correctly holds that Congress satisfied the first prerequisite , ante , at 6 , I disagree with its conclusion that Title II is valid § 5 enforcement legislation .	The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state , elected by the people thereof , for six years ; and each Senator shall have one vote . The electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislatures . When vacancies happen in the representation of any state in the Senate , the executive authority of such state shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies : Provided , that the legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct . This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution .	0

In Garrett , we conducted the three - step inquiry first enunciated in City of Boerne to determine whether Title I of the ADA satisfied the congruence - and - proportionality test .

Even if it were proper to consider this broader category of evidence , much of it does not concern unconstitutional action by the States .

The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts . This conclusion gains even more support when Title IIs nonexistent record of constitutional violations is compared with legislation that we have sustained as valid § 5 enforcement legislation . See , e.g. , Hibbs , 538 U. S. , at 729732 ( tracing the extensive legislative record documenting States gender discrimination in employment leave policies ) ; South Carolina v. Katzenbach , 383 U. S. 301 , 312313 ( 1966 ) ( same with respect to racial discrimination in voting rights ) . Accordingly , Title II can only be understood as a congressional attempt to rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment law laid down by this Court, rather than a legitimate effort to remedy or prevent state violations of that Amendment .

Despite subjecting States to this expansive liability, the broad terms of Title II d[o ] nothing to limit the coverage of the Act to cases involving arguable constitutional violations. Florida Prepaid , 527 U. S. , at 646 . By requiring special accommodation and the elimination of programs that have a disparate impact on the disabled , Title II prohibits far more state conduct than does the equal protection ban on irrational discrimination . We invalidated Title Is similar requirements in Garrett , observing that [i]f special accommodations for the disabled are to be required , they have to come from positive law and not through the Equal Protection Clause. 531 U.

Despite subjecting States to this expansive liability, the broad terms of Title II d[o ] nothing to limit the coverage of the Act to cases involving arguable constitutional violations. Florida Prepaid , 527 U. S. , at 646 . By requiring special accommodation and the elimination of programs that have a disparate impact on the disabled , Title II prohibits far more state conduct than does the equal protection ban on irrational discrimination . We invalidated Title Is similar requirements in Garrett , observing that [i]f special accommodations for the disabled are to be required , they have to come from positive law and not through the Equal Protection Clause. 531 U.

Kimel , 528 U. S. , at 88 .	All debts contracted and engagements entered into , before the adoption of this Constitution , shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution , as under the Confederation . This Constitution , and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof ; and all treaties made , or which shall be made , under the authority of the United States , shall be the supreme law of the land ; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby , anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding . The Senators and Representatives before mentioned , and the members of the several state legislatures , and all executive and judicial officers , both of the United States and of the several states , shall be bound by oath or affirmation , to support this Constitution ; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States .	0
The majority , however , claims that Title II also vindicates fundamental rights protected by the Due Process Clausein addition to access to the courtsthat are subject to heightened Fourteenth Amendment scrutiny . Ante , at 11 ( citing Dunn v. Blumstein , 405 U. S. 330 , 336337 ( 1972 ) ( voting ) ; Shapiro v. Thompson , 394 U. S. 618 , 634 ( 1969 ) ( right to move to a new jurisdiction ) ; Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel . Williamson , 316 U. S. 535 , 541 ( 1942 ) ( marriage and procreation ) ) . But Title II is not tailored to provide prophylactic protection of these rights ; instead , it applies to any service , program , or activity provided by any entity . Its provisions affect transportation , health , education , and recreation programs , among many others , all of which are accorded only rational - basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause . A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state - owned amusement park or sports stadium , for example , bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights . Thus , as with Title I in Garrett , the Patent Remedy Act in Florida Prepaid , the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 in Kimel , and the RFRA in City of Boerne , all of which we invalidated as attempts to substantively redefine the Fourteenth Amendment , it is unlikely that many of the [ state actions ] affected by [ Title II ] ha[ve ] any likelihood of being unconstitutional. City of Boerne , supra , at 532 .

This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy .	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

I fear that the Courts adoption of an as - applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft § 5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations . Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute , such as Title II , may be enforced against the States . All the while , States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their Eleventh Amendment rights . The majoritys as - applied approach simply can not be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary .	No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia , when in actual service in time of war or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation .	0

In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation , the Vice President shall become President .

Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide , transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office , the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President .

Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue , assembling within forty - eight hours for that purpose if not in session . If the Congress , within twenty - one days after receipt of the latter written declaration , or , if Congress is not in session , within twenty - one days after Congress is required to assemble , determines by two - thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office , the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President ; otherwise , the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office .	0
In Board of Trustees of Univ . of Ala. v. Garrett , 531 U.

C. § § 1211112117 . Today , the Court concludes that Title II of that Act , § § 1213112165 , does validly abrogate that immunity , at least insofar as it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts. Ante , at 19 . Because todays decision is irreconcilable with Garrett and the well - established principles it embodies , I dissent .

In Garrett , we conducted the three - step inquiry first enunciated in City of Boerne to determine whether Title I of the ADA satisfied the congruence - and - proportionality test . A faithful application of that test to Title II reveals that it too  substantively redefine[s],  rather than permissibly enforces , the rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment .

The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President , for electors for President or Vice President , or for Senator or Representative in Congress , shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax .

The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states . A person charged in any state with treason , felony , or other crime , who shall flee from justice , and be found in another state , shall on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled , be delivered up , to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime .

Even if it were proper to consider this broader category of evidence , much of it does not concern unconstitutional action by the States . The bulk of the Courts evidence concerns discrimination by nonstate governments , rather than the States themselves . 2 We have repeatedly held that such evidence is irrelevant to the inquiry whether Congress has validly abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity , a privilege enjoyed only by the sovereign States .

Therefore , even outside the access to the courts context , the Court identifies few , if any , constitutional violations perpetrated by the States against disabled persons . 3	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each state , excluding Indians not taxed . But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof .

Despite subjecting States to this expansive liability, the broad terms of Title II d[o ] nothing to limit the coverage of the Act to cases involving arguable constitutional violations. Florida Prepaid , 527 U.

The majority , however , claims that Title II also vindicates fundamental rights protected by the Due Process Clausein addition to access to the courtsthat are subject to heightened Fourteenth Amendment scrutiny . Ante , at 11 ( citing Dunn v. Blumstein , 405 U. S. 330 , 336337 ( 1972 ) ( voting ) ; Shapiro v. Thompson , 394 U. S. 618 , 634 ( 1969 ) ( right to move to a new jurisdiction ) ; Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel . Williamson , 316 U. S. 535 , 541 ( 1942 ) ( marriage and procreation ) ) . But Title II is not tailored to provide prophylactic protection of these rights ; instead , it applies to any service , program , or activity provided by any entity . Its provisions affect transportation , health , education , and recreation programs , among many others , all of which are accorded only rational - basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause . A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state - owned amusement park or sports stadium , for example , bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights . Thus , as with Title I in Garrett , the Patent Remedy Act in Florida Prepaid , the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 in Kimel , and the RFRA in City of Boerne , all of which we invalidated as attempts to substantively redefine the Fourteenth Amendment , it is unlikely that many of the [ state actions ] affected by [ Title II ] ha[ve ] any likelihood of being unconstitutional. City of Boerne , supra , at 532 .

The majority concludes that Title IIs massive overbreadth can be cured by considering the statute only as it applies to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of judicial services. Ante , at 20 ( citing United States v. Raines , 362 U. S. 17 , 26 ( 1960 ) ) . I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the § 5 context . While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case , the proper inquiry under City of Boerne and its progeny is somewhat different . In applying the congruence - and - proportionality test , we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment . This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy .

I fear that the Courts adoption of an as - applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft § 5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations . Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute , such as Title II , may be enforced against the States . All the while , States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their Eleventh Amendment rights . The majoritys as - applied approach simply can not be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary .	The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states . A person charged in any state with treason , felony , or other crime , who shall flee from justice , and be found in another state , shall on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled , be delivered up , to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime .

In Board of Trustees of Univ . of Ala. v. Garrett , 531 U.

Today , the Court concludes that Title II of that Act , § § 1213112165 , does validly abrogate that immunity , at least insofar as it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts. Ante , at 19 .

The Eleventh Amendment bars private lawsuits in federal court against an unconsenting State . E.g. , Nevada Dept . of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U.

Congress may overcome States sovereign immunity and authorize such suits only if it unmistakably expresses its intent to do so , and only if it acts pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Hibbs , supra , at 726 . While the Court correctly holds that Congress satisfied the first prerequisite , ante , at 6 , I disagree with its conclusion that Title II is valid § 5 enforcement legislation .

Garrett , supra , at 370371 . Therefore , even outside the access to the courts context , the Court identifies few , if any , constitutional violations perpetrated by the States against disabled persons . 3	The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state , chosen by the legislature thereof , for six years ; and each Senator shall have one vote . Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election , they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes . The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen by resignation , or otherwise , during the recess of the legislature of any state , the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature , which shall then fill such vacancies . No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years , and been nine years a citizen of the United States and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen . The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate , but shall have no vote , unless they be equally divided . The Senate shall choose their other officers , and also a President pro tempore , in the absence of the Vice President , or when he shall exercise the office of President of the United States . The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments . When sitting for that purpose , they shall be on oath or affirmation . When the President of the United States is tried , the Chief Justice shall preside : And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present . Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office , and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor , trust or profit under the United States : but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment , trial , judgment and punishment , according to law .	0
Even if it were proper to consider this broader category of evidence , much of it does not concern unconstitutional action by the States . The bulk of the Courts evidence concerns discrimination by nonstate governments , rather than the States themselves . 2 We have repeatedly held that such evidence is irrelevant to the inquiry whether Congress has validly abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity , a privilege enjoyed only by the sovereign States . Garrett , supra , at 368369 ; Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed . Expense Bd . v. College Savings Bank , 527 U. S. 627 , 640 ( 1999 ) ; Kimel , 528 U. S. , at 89 .

Garrett , supra , at 370371 . Therefore , even outside the access to the courts context , the Court identifies few , if any , constitutional violations perpetrated by the States against disabled persons . 3	All debts contracted and engagements entered into , before the adoption of this Constitution , shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution , as under the Confederation . This Constitution , and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof ; and all treaties made , or which shall be made , under the authority of the United States , shall be the supreme law of the land ; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby , anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding . The Senators and Representatives before mentioned , and the members of the several state legislatures , and all executive and judicial officers , both of the United States and of the several states , shall be bound by oath or affirmation , to support this Constitution ; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States .	0
The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts . This conclusion gains even more support when Title IIs nonexistent record of constitutional violations is compared with legislation that we have sustained as valid § 5 enforcement legislation . See , e.g. , Hibbs , 538 U. S. , at 729732 ( tracing the extensive legislative record documenting States gender discrimination in employment leave policies ) ; South Carolina v. Katzenbach , 383 U. S. 301 , 312313 ( 1966 ) ( same with respect to racial discrimination in voting rights ) . Accordingly , Title II can only be understood as a congressional attempt to rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment law laid down by this Court, rather than a legitimate effort to remedy or prevent state violations of that Amendment . Garrett , supra , at 374 . 9	The electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for President and Vice - President , one of whom , at least , shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves ; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President , and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice - President , and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President , and of all persons voted for as Vice - President , and of the number of votes for each , which lists they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate ;-- The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted ;-- the person having the greatest number of votes for President , shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if no person have such majority , then from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President , the House of Representatives shall choose immediately , by ballot , the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by states , the representation from each state having one vote ; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two - thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . And if the House of Representatives shall not choose a President whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them , before the fourth day of March next following , then the Vice - President shall act as President , as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President . The person having the greatest number of votes as Vice - President , shall be the Vice - President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed , and if no person have a majority , then from the two highest numbers on the list , the Senate shall choose the Vice - President ; a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two - thirds of the whole number of Senators , and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice . But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice - President of the United States .	0
Despite subjecting States to this expansive liability, the broad terms of Title II d[o ] nothing to limit the coverage of the Act to cases involving arguable constitutional violations. Florida Prepaid , 527 U.

In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	0
The majority , however , claims that Title II also vindicates fundamental rights protected by the Due Process Clausein addition to access to the courtsthat are subject to heightened Fourteenth Amendment scrutiny . Ante , at 11 ( citing Dunn v. Blumstein , 405 U. S. 330 , 336337 ( 1972 ) ( voting ) ; Shapiro v. Thompson , 394 U. S. 618 , 634 ( 1969 ) ( right to move to a new jurisdiction ) ; Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel . Williamson , 316 U. S. 535 , 541 ( 1942 ) ( marriage and procreation ) ) . But Title II is not tailored to provide prophylactic protection of these rights ; instead , it applies to any service , program , or activity provided by any entity . Its provisions affect transportation , health , education , and recreation programs , among many others , all of which are accorded only rational - basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause . A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state - owned amusement park or sports stadium , for example , bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights . Thus , as with Title I in Garrett , the Patent Remedy Act in Florida Prepaid , the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 in Kimel , and the RFRA in City of Boerne , all of which we invalidated as attempts to substantively redefine the Fourteenth Amendment , it is unlikely that many of the [ state actions ] affected by [ Title II ] ha[ve ] any likelihood of being unconstitutional. City of Boerne , supra , at 532 . Viewed as a whole , then , there is little doubt that Title II of the ADA does not validly abrogate state sovereign immunity . 10	The judicial power shall extend to all cases , in law and equity , arising under this Constitution , the laws of the United States , and treaties made , or which shall be made , under their authority ;-- to all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls ;-- to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ;-- to controversies to which the United States shall be a party ;-- to controversies between two or more states ;-- between a state and citizens of another state ;-- between citizens of different states ;-- between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states , and between a state , or the citizens thereof , and foreign states , citizens or subjects . In all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , and those in which a state shall be party , the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction . In all the other cases before mentioned , the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction , both as to law and fact , with such exceptions , and under such regulations as the Congress shall make . The trial of all crimes , except in cases of impeachment , shall be by jury ; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed ; but when not committed within any state , the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed .	0
The majority concludes that Title IIs massive overbreadth can be cured by considering the statute only as it applies to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of judicial services. Ante , at 20 ( citing United States v. Raines , 362 U. S. 17 , 26 ( 1960 ) ) . I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the § 5 context . While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case , the proper inquiry under City of Boerne and its progeny is somewhat different . In applying the congruence - and - proportionality test , we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment . This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	0

I fear that the Courts adoption of an as - applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft § 5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations . Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute , such as Title II , may be enforced against the States . All the while , States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their Eleventh Amendment rights . The majoritys as - applied approach simply can not be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary .	All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it become a law , be presented to the President of the United States ; if he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it . If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law . But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays , and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively . If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall have been presented to him , the same shall be a law , in like manner as if he had signed it , unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return , in which case it shall not be a law . Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill .	0
In Board of Trustees of Univ . of Ala. v. Garrett , 531 U.

In Garrett , we conducted the three - step inquiry first enunciated in City of Boerne to determine whether Title I of the ADA satisfied the congruence - and - proportionality test . A faithful application of that test to Title II reveals that it too  substantively redefine[s],  rather than permissibly enforces , the rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment . Hibbs , supra , at 728 .	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0
Even if it were proper to consider this broader category of evidence , much of it does not concern unconstitutional action by the States .

Garrett , supra , at 370371 . Therefore , even outside the access to the courts context , the Court identifies few , if any , constitutional violations perpetrated by the States against disabled persons . 3	Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the United States , or any place subject to their jurisdiction .

Even if it were proper to consider this broader category of evidence , much of it does not concern unconstitutional action by the States . The bulk of the Courts evidence concerns discrimination by nonstate governments , rather than the States themselves . 2 We have repeatedly held that such evidence is irrelevant to the inquiry whether Congress has validly abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity , a privilege enjoyed only by the sovereign States . Garrett , supra , at 368369 ; Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed . Expense Bd . v. College Savings Bank , 527 U. S. 627 , 640 ( 1999 ) ; Kimel , 528 U. S. , at 89 . Moreover , the majority today cites the same congressional task force evidence we rejected in Garrett . Ante , at 15 ( citing Garrett , supra , at 379 ( Breyer , J. , dissenting ) , and 531 U. S. , at 391424 ( App . C to opinion of Breyer , J. , dissenting ) ( chronicling instances of unequal treatment in the administration of public programs ) ) . As in Garrett , this unexamined , anecdotal evidence does not suffice . 531 U. S. , at 370 . Most of the brief anecdotes do not involve States at all , and those that do are not sufficiently detailed to determine whether the instances of unequal treatment were irrational , and thus unconstitutional under our decision in Cleburne . Garrett , supra , at 370371 . Therefore , even outside the access to the courts context , the Court identifies few , if any , constitutional violations perpetrated by the States against disabled persons . 3	The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people .	0
The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts . This conclusion gains even more support when Title IIs nonexistent record of constitutional violations is compared with legislation that we have sustained as valid § 5 enforcement legislation . See , e.g. , Hibbs , 538 U. S. , at 729732 ( tracing the extensive legislative record documenting States gender discrimination in employment leave policies ) ; South Carolina v. Katzenbach , 383 U. S. 301 , 312313 ( 1966 ) ( same with respect to racial discrimination in voting rights ) . Accordingly , Title II can only be understood as a congressional attempt to rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment law laid down by this Court, rather than a legitimate effort to remedy or prevent state violations of that Amendment . Garrett , supra , at 374 . 9	The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states , and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature . No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty five years , and been seven years a citizen of the United States , and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen . Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union , according to their respective numbers , which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons , including those bound to service for a term of years , and excluding Indians not taxed , three fifths of all other Persons . The actual Enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States , and within every subsequent term of ten years , in such manner as they shall by law direct . The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand , but each state shall have at least one Representative ; and until such enumeration shall be made , the state of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three , Massachusetts eight , Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one , Connecticut five , New York six , New Jersey four , Pennsylvania eight , Delaware one , Maryland six , Virginia ten , North Carolina five , South Carolina five , and Georgia three . When vacancies happen in the Representation from any state , the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies . The House of Representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers ; and shall have the sole power of impeachment .	0

Despite subjecting States to this expansive liability, the broad terms of Title II d[o ] nothing to limit the coverage of the Act to cases involving arguable constitutional violations. Florida Prepaid , 527 U. S. , at 646 . By requiring special accommodation and the elimination of programs that have a disparate impact on the disabled , Title II prohibits far more state conduct than does the equal protection ban on irrational discrimination . We invalidated Title Is similar requirements in Garrett , observing that [i]f special accommodations for the disabled are to be required , they have to come from positive law and not through the Equal Protection Clause. 531 U. S. , at 368 ; i d . , at 372373 ( contrasting Title Is reasonable accommodation and disparate impact provisions with the Fourteenth Amendments requirements ) . Title II fails for the same reason . Like Title I , Title II may be laudable public policy , but it can not be seriously disputed that it is also an attempt to legislatively redefine the States legal obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment . Kimel , 528 U. S. , at 88 .	No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia , when in actual service in time of war or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation .	0
The majority , however , claims that Title II also vindicates fundamental rights protected by the Due Process Clausein addition to access to the courtsthat are subject to heightened Fourteenth Amendment scrutiny . Ante , at 11 ( citing Dunn v. Blumstein , 405 U. S. 330 , 336337 ( 1972 ) ( voting ) ; Shapiro v. Thompson , 394 U. S. 618 , 634 ( 1969 ) ( right to move to a new jurisdiction ) ; Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel . Williamson , 316 U. S. 535 , 541 ( 1942 ) ( marriage and procreation ) ) . But Title II is not tailored to provide prophylactic protection of these rights ; instead , it applies to any service , program , or activity provided by any entity . Its provisions affect transportation , health , education , and recreation programs , among many others , all of which are accorded only rational - basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause . A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state - owned amusement park or sports stadium , for example , bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights . Thus , as with Title I in Garrett , the Patent Remedy Act in Florida Prepaid , the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 in Kimel , and the RFRA in City of Boerne , all of which we invalidated as attempts to substantively redefine the Fourteenth Amendment , it is unlikely that many of the [ state actions ] affected by [ Title II ] ha[ve ] any likelihood of being unconstitutional. City of Boerne , supra , at 532 . Viewed as a whole , then , there is little doubt that Title II of the ADA does not validly abrogate state sovereign immunity . 10	No law , varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives , shall take effect , until an election of Representatives shall have intervened .	0

The majority concludes that Title IIs massive overbreadth can be cured by considering the statute only as it applies to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of judicial services. Ante , at 20 ( citing United States v. Raines , 362 U. S. 17 , 26 ( 1960 ) ) . I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the § 5 context . While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case , the proper inquiry under City of Boerne and its progeny is somewhat different . In applying the congruence - and - proportionality test , we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment .

I fear that the Courts adoption of an as - applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft § 5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations . Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute , such as Title II , may be enforced against the States . All the while , States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their Eleventh Amendment rights . The majoritys as - applied approach simply can not be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary .	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0
