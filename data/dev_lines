Imprisoned by the State of Colorado and alleging violations of his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment , William Erickson , the petitioner in this Court , filed suit against prison officials in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado . He alleged that a liver condition resulting from hepatitis C required a treatment program that officials had commenced but then wrongfully terminated , with life - threatening consequences . Deeming these allegations , and others to be noted , to be conclusory, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the District Courts dismissal of petitioners complaint . 198Fed .

Petitioner was incarcerated in the Limon Correctional Facility in Limon , Colorado , where respondents Barry Pardus and Dr. Anita Bloor were working as prison officials . After Dr. Bloor removed petitioner from the hepatitis C treatment he had been receiving , petitioner sued under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 , complaining , inter alia , that Dr. Bloor had violated his Eighth Amendment rights by demonstrating deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs . See , e.g. , Estelle v. Gamble , 429 U. S. 97 , 104105 ( 1976 ) ( [D]eliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain . . . proscribed by the Eighth Amendment, and this includes indifference . . . manifested by prison doctors in their response to the prisoners needs or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed ( footnotes and internal quotation marks omitted ) ) ; see also Helling v. McKinney , 509 U. S. 25 , 3537 ( 1993 ) .	Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted .	35
Petitioner based his claim on the following allegations , which we assume to be true for purposes of review here : Officials at Colorados Department of Corrections ( Department ) diagnosed petitioner as requiring treatment for hepatitis C. After completing the necessary classes and otherwise complying with the protocols set forth by the Department , petitioner began treatment for the disease . The treatment , which would take a year to complete , involved weekly self - injections of medication by use of a syringe . Soon after petitioner began this treatment , prison officials were unable to account for one of the syringes made available to petitioner ( and other prisoners ) for medical purposes . Upon searching , they found it in a communal trash can , modified in a manner suggestive of use for injection of illegal drugs . Prisoner Complaint in Civ . Action No . 05CV00405LTBMJW ( D. Colo. ) , p. 3 ( hereinafter Petitioners Complaint ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Prison officials , disbelieving petitioners claim not to have taken the syringe , found that his conduct constituted a violation of the Colorado Code of Penal Discipline for possession of drug paraphernalia . Letter from Anthony A. DeCesaro to William Erickson ( Sept. 30 , 2004 ) , attached to Petitioners Complaint . This conduct , according to the officials , led to the reasonable inference that petitioner had intended to use drugs , so the officials removed petitioner from his hepatitis C treatment . Ibid . The successful treatment of Hepatitis C is incumbent upon the individual remaining drug and alcohol free to give the liver a better chance of recovery, they indicated , ibid . , an explanation they later offered to defend against petitioners allegations of cruel and unusual punishment , see Defendants Motion to Dismiss in Civ . Action No . 05CV00405LTBMJW , p. 10 . Assuming that a person in the course of this treatment takes illicit drugs , the prisons protocol mandates a waiting period of one year followed by a mandatory drug education class lasting six months .

Three months after filing his complaint , and well before the District Court entered a judgment against him , petitioner filed a Motion for Expedited Review Due to Imminent Danger , in Civ . Action No . 05B405 ( MJW ) ( D. Colo. ) . Indicating it was undisputed that he had hepatitis C , that he met the Departments standards for treatment of the disease , and that furtherance of this disease can cause irreversible damage to [ his ] liver and possible death, petitioner alleged that numerous inmates in his prison community had died of the disease and that he was in imminent danger himself due to [ the Departments ] refusal to treat him. Ibid . He had identified similar allegations in an earlier filing , explaining that his liver is suffering irreversible damage due to the decision to remove him from treatment and that he will suffer irreparable damage if his disease goes untreated. Plaintiffs Objections to the Magistrates Recommendations in Civ .

Respondents answered these filings with a motion to dismiss . The Magistrate Judge recommended , as relevant , that the District Court dismiss the complaint on the ground it failed to allege Dr. Bloors actions had caused petitioner substantial harm. Recommendation on Defendants Motion To Dismiss , p. 12 . The District Court issued a short order indicating its agreement with the Magistrate Judge and dismissing the complaint .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court of Appeals affirmed . It quoted extensively from the Magistrate Judges discussion of substantial harm before holding that petitioner had made only conclusory allegations to the effect that he has suffered a cognizable independent harm as a result of his removal from the [ hepatitis C ] treatment program. 198 Fed . Appx . , at 698 . Acknowledging decisions by courts that have found Eighth Amendment violations when delays in medical treatment have involved life - threatening situations and instances in which it is apparent that delay would exacerbate the prisoners medical problems ( and that have , moreover , indicated the Eighth Amendment protects against future harm to an inmate ) , i d . , at 697 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) , the court nevertheless found petitioners complaint deficient : Petitioner had , according to the court , failed to allege that as a result of the discontinuance of the treatment itself shortly after it began or the interruption of treatment for approximately eighteen months he suffered any harm , let alone substantial harm , [ other ] than what he already faced from the Hepatitis C itself, i d . , at 698 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . Having reached this conclusion , the court saw no need to address whether the complaint alleged facts sufficient to support a finding that Dr. Bloor had made her decisions with a sufficiently culpable state of mind. Id. , at 697 , 698 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .	Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted .	35
It may in the final analysis be shown that the District Court was correct to grant respondents motion to dismiss . That is not the issue here , however . It was error for the Court of Appeals to conclude that the allegations in question , concerning harm caused petitioner by the termination of his medication , were too conclusory to establish for pleading purposes that petitioner had suffered a cognizable independent harm as a result of his removal from the hepatitis C treatment program .

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2 ) requires only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief. Specific facts are not necessary ; the statement need only  give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.  Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

The complaint stated that Dr. Bloors decision to remove petitioner from his prescribed hepatitis C medication was endangering [ his ] life. Petitioners Complaint 2 .

The Court of Appeals departure from the liberal pleading standards set forth by Rule 8(a)(2 ) is even more pronounced in this particular case because petitioner has been proceeding , from the litigations outset , without counsel . A document filed pro se is to be liberally construed, Estelle , 429 U.

( a ) Patronage dismissals severely restrict political belief and association , which constitute the core of those activities protected by the First Amendment , and government may not , without seriously inhibiting First Amendment rights , force a public employee to relinquish his right to political association as the price of holding a public job .

( c ) The inefficiency resulting from wholesale replacement of public employees on a change of administration belies the argument that employees not of the same political persuasion as the controlling party will not be motivated to work effectively ; nor is it clear that patronage appointees are more qualified than those they replace .

In December 1970 , the Sheriff of Cook County , a Republican , was replaced by Richard Elrod , a Democrat . At that time , respondents , all Republicans , were employees of the Cook County Sheriff 's Office . They were non - civil - service employees and , therefore , not covered by any statute , ordinance , or regulation protecting them from arbitrary discharge . One respondent , John Burns , was Chief Deputy of the Process Division and supervised all departments of the Sheriff 's Office working on the seventh floor of the building housing that office . Frank Vargas was a bailiff and security guard at the Juvenile Court of Cook County . Fred L. Buckley was employed as a process server in the office .

It has been the practice of the Sheriff of Cook County , when he assumes office from a Sheriff of a different political party , to replace non - civil - service employees of the Sheriffs ' Office with members of his own party when the existing employees lack or fail to obtain requisite support from , or fail to affiliate with , that party . Consequently , subsequent to Sheriff Elrod 's assumption of office , respondents , with the exception of Buckley , were discharged from their employment solely because they did not support and were not members of the Democratic Party and had failed to obtain the sponsorship of one of its leaders . Buckley is in imminent danger of being discharged solely for the same reasons .

A question presented to this Court for decision is properly deemed political when its resolution is committed by the Constitution to a branch of the Federal Government other than this Court . Baker v. Carr , 369 U.S. 186 , 217 , 82 S.Ct . 691 , 710 , 7 L.Ed.2d 663 ( 1962 ) . Thus , " it is the relationship between the judiciary and the coordinate branches of the Federal Government , and not the federal judiciary 's relationship to the States , which gives rise to the ' political question . ' " Id. , 369 U.S. at 210 , 82 S.Ct . at 706 . That matters related to a State 's , or even the Federal Government 's , elective process are implicated by this Court 's resolution of a question is not sufficient to justify our withholding decision of the question . In particular , in this case , ware asked only to determine whether the politically motivated discharge of employees of the Cook County Sheriff 's Office comports with the limitations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments . This involves solely a question of constitutional interpretation , a function ultimately the responsibility of this Court . Id. , 369 U.S. at 211 , 82 S.Ct . at 706 . See Powell v. McCormack , 395 U.S. 486 , 518 - 549 , 89 S.Ct . 1944 , 1962 - 1978 , 23 L.Ed.2d 491 ( 1969 ) . Petitioners do not , and could not , argue that a decision as to the constitutionality of the Sheriff 's practices should be left to Congress or the President . The political - question doctrine , therefore , is no obstacle to judicial review in this case . See Williams v. Rhodes , 393 U.S. 23 , 28 , 89 S.Ct . 5 , 9 , 21 L.Ed.2d 24 ( 1968 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Petitioners also object that our review of this case will offend the principle of separation of powers , for the executive 's responsibility to insure that the laws be faithfully executed requires the power of appointment or removal at will , unimpaired by any judicial oversight . They cite Myers v. United States , 272 U.S. 52 , 47 S.Ct . 21 , 71 L.Ed . 160 ( 1926 ) , in support of their argument . The short answer to this argument is that the separation - of - powers principle , like the political - question doctrine , has no applicability to the federal judiciary 's relationship to the States . The matter in Myers itself was limited to the permissibility of restraints imposed by Congress on the President concerning the removal of the executive officers . More fundamentally , however , the answer to petitioners ' objection is that there can be no impairment of executive power , whether on the state or federal level , where actions pursuant to that power are impermissible under the Constitution . Where there is no power , there can be no impairment of power . And our determination of the limits on state executive power contained in the Constitution is in proper keeping with our primary responsibility of interpreting that document . It is to such a determination that we now turn .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Cook County Sheriff 's practice of dismissing employees on a partisan basis is but one form of the general practice of political patronage . 2 The practice also includes placing loyal supporters in government jobs that may or may not have been made available by political discharges . Nonofficeholders may be the beneficiaries of lucrative government contracts for highway construction , buildings , and supplies . Favored wards may receive improved public services . Members of the judiciary may even engage in the practice through the appointment of receiverships , trusteeships , and refereeships . Although political patronage comprises a broad range of activities , we are here concerned only with the constitutionality of dismissing public employees for partisan reasons .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Patronage practice is not new to American politics . It has existed at the federal level at least since the Presidency of Thomas Jefferson , 3 although its popularization and legitimation primarily occurred later , in the Presidency of Andrew Jackson . 4 The practice is not unique to American politics . It has been used in many European countries , 5 and in darker times , it played a significant role in the Nazi rise to power in Germany and other totalitarian states . 6 More recent times have witnessed a strong decline in its use , particularly with respect to public employment . Indeed , only a few decades after Andrew Jackson 's administration , strong discontent with the corruption and inefficiency of the patronage system of public employment eventuated in the Pendleton Act , 7 the foundation of modern civil service . And on the state and local levels , merit systems have increasingly displaced the practice . 8 This trend led the Court to observe in CSC v. National Association of Letter Carriers , 413 U.S. 548 , 564 , 93 S.Ct . 2880 , 2889 , 37 L.Ed.2d 796 ( 1973 ) , that " the judgment of Congress , the Executive , and the country appears to have been that partisan political activities by federal employees must be limited if the Government is to operate effectively and fairly , elections are to play their proper part in representative government , and employees themselves are to be sufficiently free from improper influences . "	@@empty@@	unmatched
The decline of patronage employment is not , of course relevant to the question of its constitutionality . It is the practice itself , not the magnitude of its occurrence , the constitutionality of which must be determined . Nor for that matter does any unacceptability of the practice signified by its decline indicate its unconstitutionality . Our inquiry does not begin with the judgment of history , though the actual operation of a practice viewed in retrospect may help to assess its workings with respect to constitutional limitations . Compare Brown v. Board of Education , 347 U.S. 483 , 74 S.Ct . 686 , 98 L.Ed . 873 ( 1954 ) , with Plessy v. Ferguson , 163 U.S. 537 , 16 S.Ct . 1138 , 41 L.Ed . 256 ( 1896 ) . Rather , inquiry must commence with identification of the constitutional limitations implicated by a challenged governmental practice . 9	@@empty@@	unmatched
The cost of the practice of patronage is the restraint it places on freedoms of belief and association . In order to maintain their jobs , respondents were required to pledge their political allegiance to the Democratic Party , work for the election of other candidates of the Democratic Party , contribute a portion of their wages to the Party , or obtain the sponsorship of a member of the Party , usually at the price of one of the first three alternatives . Regardless of the incumbent party 's identity , Democratic or otherwise , the consequences for association and belief are the same . An individual who is a member of the out - party maintains affiliation with his own party at the risk of losing his job . He works for the election of his party 's candidates and espouses its policies at the same risk . The financial and campaign assistance that he is induced to provide to another party furthers the advancement of that party 's policies to the detriment of his party 's views and ultimately his own beliefs , and any assessment of his salary is tantamount to coerced belief . See Buckley v. Valeo , 424 U.S. 1 , 19 , 96 S.Ct . 612 , 634 - 635 , 46 L.Ed.2d 659 ( 1976 ) . Even a pledge of allegiance to another party , however ostensible , only serves to compromise the individual 's true beliefs . Since the average public employee is hardly in the financial position to support his party and another , or to lend his time to two parties , the individual 's ability to act according to his beliefs and to associate with others of his political persuasion is constrained , and support for his party is diminished .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is not only belief and association which are restricted where political patronage is the practice . The free functioning of the electoral process also suffers . Conditioning public employment on partisan support prevents support of competing political interests . Existing employees are deterred from such support , as well as the multitude seeking jobs . As government employment , state or federal , becomes more pervasive , the greater the dependence on it becomes , and therefore the greater becomes the power to starve political opposition by commanding partisan support , financial and otherwise . Patronage thus tips the electoral process in favor of the incumbent party , and where the practice 's scope is substantial relative to the size of the electorate , the impact on the process can be significant .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Our concern with the impact of patronage on political believe and association does not occur in the abstract , for political belief and association constitute the core of those activities protected by the First Amendment . 10 Regardless of the nature of the inducement , whether it be by the denial of public employment or , as in Board of Education v. Barnette , 319 U.S. 624 , 63 S.Ct . 1178 , 87 L.Ed . 1628 ( 1943 ) , by the influence of a teacher over students , " ( i)f there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation , it is that no official , high or petty , can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics , nationalism , religion , or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein . " Id. , 319 U.S. , at 642 , 63 S.Ct . , at 1187 . And , though freedom of belief is central , " ( t)he First Amendme protects political association as well as political expression . " Buckley v. Valeo , supra , 424 U.S. at 11 , 96 S.Ct . at 632 . " There can no longer be any doubt that freedom to associate with others for the common advancement of political beliefs and ideas is a form of ' orderly group activity ' protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments . NAACP v. Button , 371 U.S. 415 , 430 , 83 S.Ct . 328 , 336 , 9 L.Ed.2d 405 ; Bates v. Little Rock , 361 U.S. 516 , 522 - 523 , 80 S.Ct . 412 , 416 - 417 , 4 L.Ed.2d 480 ; NAACP v.

Particularly pertinent to the constitutionality of the practice of patronage dismissals are Keyishian v. Board of Regents , 385 U.S. 589 , 87 S.Ct . 675 , 17 L.Ed.2d 629 ( 1967 ) , and Perry v.

In Keyishian , the Court invalidated New York statutes barring employment merely on the basis of membership in " subversive " organizations . Keyishian squarely held that political association alone could not , consistently with the First Amendment , constitute an adequate ground for denying public employment . 12 In Perry , the Court broadly rejected thealidity of limitations on First Amendment rights as a condition to the receipt of a governmental benefit , stating that the government " may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests especially , his interest in freedom of speech . For if the government could deny a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations , his exercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited . This would allow the government to ' produce a result which ( it ) could not command directly . ' Speiser v. Randall , 357 U.S. 513 , 526 , 78 S.Ct . 1332 , 1342 , 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 .

Patronage practice falls squarely within the prohibitions of Keyishian and Perry . Under that practice , public employees hold their jobs on the condition that they provide , in some acceptable manner , support for the favored political party . The threat of dismissal for failure to provide that support unquestionably inhibits protected belief and association , and dismissal for failure to provide support only penalizes its exercise . The belief and association which government may not ordain directly are achieved by indirection . 13 And regardless of how evenhandedly these restraints may operate in the long run , after political office has changed hands several times , protected interests are still infringed and thus the violation remains .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Although the practice of patronage dismissals clearly infringes First Amendment interests , our inquiry is not at an end , for the prohibition on encroachment of First Amendment protections is not an absolute . Restraints are permitted for appropriate reasons . Keyishian and Perry , however , not only serve to establish a presumptive prohibition on infringement , but also serve to dispose of one suggested by petitioners ' reference to this Court 's affirmance by an equally divided court in Bailey v. Richardson , 341 U.S. 918 , 71 S.Ct . 669 , 95 L.Ed . 1352 ( 1951 ) , aff'g 86 U.S.App . D.C. 248 , 182 F.2d 46 ( 1950 ) . 14 That is the notion that because there is no right to a government benefit , such as public employment , the benefit may be denied for any reason . Perry , however , emphasized that " for at least a quarter - century , this Court has made clear that even though a person has no ' right ' to a valuable governmental benefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons , there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely . " 408 U.S. , at 597 , 92 S.Ct . , at 2697 . Perry and Keyishian properly recognizene such impermissible reason : The denial of a public benefit may not be used by the government for the purpose of creating an incentive enabling it to achieve what it may not command directly . " ' The theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions , regardless of how unreasonable , has been uniformly rejected . ' " Keyishian v. Board of Regents , 385 U.S. , at 605 - 606 , 87 S.Ct . , at 685 .

While the right - privilege distinction furnishes no ground on which to justify patronage , petitioners raise several other justifications requiring consideration . Before examining those justifications , however , it is necessary to have in mind the standards according to which their sufficiency is to be measured . It is firmly established that a significant impairment of First Amendment rights must survive exacting scrutiny . Buckley v. Valeo , 424 U.S. , at 64 - 65 , 96 S.Ct . , at 656 ; NAACP v. Alabama , 357 U.S. 449 , 460 - 461 , 78 S.Ct . 1163 , 1170 - 1171 , 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 ( 1958 ) . " This type of scrutiny is necessary even if any deterrent effect on the exercise of First Amendment rights arises , not through direct government action , but indirectly as an unintended but inevitable result of the government 's conduct . . . . " Buckley v. Valeo , supra , 424 U.S. , at 65 , 96 S.Ct . , at 656 . Thus encroachment " can not be justified upon a mere showing of a legitimate state interest . " Kusper v. Pontikes , 414 U.S. , at 58 , 94 S.Ct . , at 308 . The interest advanced must be paramount , one of vital importance , and the burden is on the government to show the existence of such an interest . Buckley v. Valeo , supra , 424 U.S. , at 94 , 96 S.Ct . , at 670 ; Williams v. Rhodes , 393 U.S. , at 31 - 33 , 89 S.Ct . , at 10 - 11 ; NAACP v. Button , 371 U.S. 415 , 438 , 444 , 83 S.Ct . 328 , 340 , 343 , 9 L.Ed.2d 405 ( 1963 ) ; Bates v. Little Rock , 361 U.S. 516 , 524 , 80 S.Ct . 412 , 417 , 4 L.Ed.2d 480 ( 1960 ) ; NAACP v. Alabama , supra , 357 U.S. , at 464 - 466 , 78 S.Ct . , at 1172 - 1173 ; Thomas v. Collins , 323 U.S. 516 , 530 , 65 S.Ct . 315 , 322 , 89 L.Ed . 430 ( 1945 ) . In the instant case , care must be taken not to confuse the interest of partisan organizations with governmental interests . Only the latter will suffice . Moreover , it is not enough that the means chosen in furtherance of the interest be rationally related to that end . Sherbert v. Verner , supra , 374 U.S. at 406 , 83 S.Ct . at 1795 . The gain to the subordinating interest provided by the means must outweigh the incurred loss of protected rights , see United Public Workers v. Mitchell , 330 U.S. , at 96 , 67 S.Ct . , at 567 , 16 and the government must " emplo(y ) means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgnt . . . . " Buckley v. Valeo , supra , 424 U.S. , at 25 , 96 S.Ct . , at 638 . " ( A ) State may not choose means that unnecessarily restrict constitutionally protected liberty . ' Precision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms . ' If the State has open to it a less drastic way of satisfying its legitimate interests , it may not choose a legislative scheme that broadly stifles the exercise of fundamental personal liberties . " Kusper v. Pontikes , supra , 414 U.S. , at 59 , 94 S.Ct . , at 308 ( citations omitted ) . See United States v. Robel , 389 U.S. 258 , 88 S.Ct . 419 , 19 L.Ed.2d 508 ( 1967 ) ; Shelton v. Tucker , 364 U.S. 479 , 81 S.Ct . 247 , 5 L.Ed.2d 231 ( 1960 ) . In short , if conditioning the retention of public employment on the employee 's support of the in - party is to survive constitutional challenge , it must further some vital government end by a means that is least restrictive of freedom of belief and association in achieving that end , and the benefit gained must outweigh the loss of constitutionally protected rights . 17	@@empty@@	unmatched
One interest which has been offered in justification of patronage is the need to insure effective government and the efficiency of public employees . It is argued that employees of political persuasions not the same as that of the party in control of public office will not have the incentive to work effectively and may even be motivated to subvert the incumbent administration 's efforts to govern effectively . We are not persuaded . The inefficiency resulting from the wholesale replacement of large numbers of public employees every time political office changes hands belies this justification . And the prospect of dismissal after an election in which the incumbent party has lost is only a disincentive to good work . 18 Further , it is not clear that dismissal in order to make room for a patronage appointment will result in replacement by a person more qualified to do the job since appointment often occurs in exchange for the delivery of votes , or otheparty service , not job capability . More fundamentally , however , the argument does not succeed because it is doubtful that the mere difference of political persuasion motivates poor performance ; nor do we think it legitimately may be used as a basis for imputing such behavior . The Court has consistently recognized that mere political association is an inadequate basis for imputing disposition to ill - willed conduct . See Keyishian v. Board of Regents , 385 U.S. , at 606 - 608 , 87 S.Ct . , at 685 - 686 ; Elfbrandt v. Russell , 384 U.S. 11 , 19 , 86 S.Ct . 1238 , 1242 , 16 L.Ed.2d 321 ( 1966 ) ; Wieman v. Updegraff , 344 U.S. , at 190 - 191 , 73 S.Ct . , at 218 . 19 Though those cases involved affiliation with the Communist Party , we do not " consider these ( respondents ' ) interest in freely associating with members of the ( Republican ) Party less worthy of protection than ( other ) employees ' interest in associating with Communists or former Communists . " Illinois State Employees Union v. Lewis , 473 F.2d , at 570 . At all events , less drastic means for insuring government effectiveness and employee efficiency are available to the State . Specifically , employees may always be discharged for good cause , such as insubordination or poor job performance , when those bases in fact exist .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Even if the first argument that patronage serves effectiveness and efficiency be rejected , it still may be argued that patronage serves those interests by giving the employees of an incumbent party the incentive to perform well in order to insure their party 's incumbency and thereby their jobs . Patronage , according to the argument , thus makes employees highly accountable to the public . But the ability of officials more directly accountable to the electorate to discharge employees for cause and the availability of merit systems , growth in the use of which has been quite significant , convince us that means less intrusive than patronage still exist for achieving accountability in the public work force and , thereby , effective and efficient government . The greater effectiveness of patronage over these less drastic means , if any , is at best marginal , a gain outweighed by the absence of intrusion on protected interests under the alternatives .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The lack of any justification for patronage dismissals as a means of furthering government effectiveness and efficiency distinguishes this case from CSC v. Letter Carriers , 413 U.S. 548 , 93 S.Ct . 2880 , 37 L.Ed.2d 796 ( 1973 ) , and United Public Workers v. Mitchell , 330 U.S. 75 , 67 S.Ct . 556 , 91 L.Ed . 754 ( 1949 ) . In both of those cases , legislative restraints on political management and campaigning by public employees were upheld despite their encroachment on First Amendment rights because , inter alia , they did serve in a necessary manner to foster and protect efficient and effective government . 20 Interestingly , the activities that were restrained by the legislation involved in those cases e characteristic of patronage practices . As the Court observed in Mitchell , " The conviction that an actively partisan governmental personnel threatens good administration has deepened since ( 1882 ) . Congress recognizes danger to the service in that political rather than official effort may earn advancement and to the public in that governmental favor may be channeled through political connections . " 330 U.S. at 97 - 98 , 67 S.Ct . at 568 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A second interest advanced in support of patronage is the need for political loyalty of employees , not to the end that effectiveness and efficiency be insured , but to the end that representative government not be undercut by tactics obstructing the implementation of policies of the new administration , policies presumably sanctioned by the electorate . The justification is not without force , but is nevertheless inadequate to validate patronage wholesale . Limiting patronage dismissals to policymaking positions is sufficient to achieve this governmental end . Nonpolicymaking individuals usually have only limited responsibility and are therefore not in a position to thwart the goals of the in - party .	@@empty@@	unmatched
No clear line can be drawn between policymaking and nonpolicymaking positions . While nonpolicymaking individuals usually have limited responsibility , that is not to say that one with a number of responsibilities is necessarily in a policymaking position . The nature of the responsibilities is critical . Employee supervisors , for example , may have many responsibilities , but those responsibilities may have only limited and well - defined objectives . An employee with responsibilities that are not well defined or are of broad scope more likely functions in a policymaking position . In determining whether an employee occupies a policymaking position , consideration ould also be given to whether the employee acts as an adviser or formulates plans for the implementation of broad goals . Thus , the political loyalty " justification is a matter of proof , or at least argument , directed at particular kinds of jobs . " Illinois State Employees Union v. Lewis , 473 F.2d , at 574 . Since , as we have noted , it is the government 's burden to demonstrate an overriding interest in order to validate an encroachment on protected interests , the burden of establishing this justification as to any particular respondent will rest on the petitioners on remand , cases of doubt being resolved in favor of the particular respondent .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is argued that a third interest supporting patronage dismissals is the preservation of the democratic process . According to petitioners , " ' we have contrived no system for the support of party that does not place considerable reliance on patronage . The party organization makes a democratic government work and charges a price for its services . ' " 21 The argument is thus premised on the centrality of partisan politics to the democratic process .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Preservation of the democratic process is certainly an interest protection of which may in some instances justify limitations on First Amendment freedoms . See Buckley v. Valeo , 424 U.S. 1 , 96 S.Ct . 612 , 46 L.Ed.2d 659 ( 1976 ) ; CSC v. Letter Carriers , supra ; Williams v. Rhodes , 393 U.S. 23 , 89 S.Ct . 5 , 21 L.Ed.2d 24 ( 1968 ) ; United Public Workers v. Mitchell , supra . But however important preservation of the two - party system or any system involving a fixed number of parties may or may not be , 22 Williams v. Rhodes , supra , 393 U.S. at 32 , 89 S.Ct . at 11 , we are not persuaded that the elimination of patronage practice or , as is specifically involved here , the interdiction of patronage dismissals , will bring about the demise of party politics . Political parties existed in the absence of active patronage practice prior to the administration of Andrew Jackson , and they have survived substantial reduction in their patronage power through the establishment of merit systems . 23	@@empty@@	unmatched
Patronage dismissals thus are not the least restrictive alternative to achieving the contribution they may make to the democratic process . 24 The process functions as well without the practice , perhaps even better , for patronage dismissals clearly also retard that process . Patronage can result in the entrenchment of one or a few parties to the exclusion of others . And most indisputably , as we recognized at the outset , patronage is a very effective impediment to the associational and speech freedoms which are essential to a meaningful system of democratic government . Thus , if patronage contributes at all to the elective process , that contribution is diminished by the practice 's impairment of the same . Indeed , unlike the gain to representative government provided by the Hatch Act in CSC V. Letter Carriers , supra , and United Public Workers v. Mitchell , supra , the gain to representative government provided by the practice of patronage , if any , would be insufficient to justify its sacrifice of First Amendment rights . 25	@@empty@@	unmatched
To be sure , Letter Carriers and Mitchell upheld Hatch Act restraints sacrificing political campaigning and management , activities themselves protected by the First Amendment . But in those cases it was the Court 's judgment that congressional subordination of those activities was permissible to safeguard the core interests of individual belief and association . 26 Subordination of some First Amendment activity was permissible to protect other such activity . Today , we hold that subordination of other First Amendment activity , that is , patronage dismissals , not only is permissible , but also is mandated by the First Amendment . And since patronage dismissals fall within the category of political campaigning and management , this conclusion irresistibly flows from Mitchell and Letter Carriers . For if the First Amendment did not place individual belief and association above political campaigning and management , at least in the setting of public employment , the restraints on those latter activities could not have been judged permissible in Mitchell and Letter Carriers . 27	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is apparent that at bottom we are required to engage in the resolution of conflicting interests under the First Amendment . The constitutional adjudication called for by this task is well within our province . 28 The illuminating source to which we turn in performing the task is the system of government the First Amendment was intended protect , a democratic system whose proper functioning is indispensably dependent on the unfettered judgment of each citizen on matters of political concern . Our decision in obedience to the guidance of that source does not outlaw political parties or political campaigning and management . Parties are free to exist and their concomitant activities are free to continue . We require only that the rights of every citizen to believe as he will and to act and associate according to his beliefs be free to continue as well .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In summary , patronage dismissals severely restrict political belief and association . Though there is a vital need for government efficiency and effectiveness , such dismissals are on balance not the least restrictive means for fostering that end . There is also a need to insure that policies which the electorate has sanctioned are effectively implemented . That interest can be fully satisfied by limiting patronage dismissals to policymaking positions . Finally , patronage dismissals can not be justified by their contribution to the proper functioning of our democratic process through their assistance to partisan politics since political parties are nurtured by other , less intrusive and equally effective methods . More fundamentally , however , any contribution of patronage dismissals to the democratic process does not suffice to override their severe encroachment on First Amendment freedoms . We hold , therefore , that the practice of patronage dismissals is unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments , and that respondents thus stated a valid claim for relief .	@@empty@@	unmatched
There remains the question whether the issuance of a preliminary injunction was properly directed by the Court of Appeals . The District Court predicated its denial of respondents ' motion for a preliminary injunction on its finding that the allegations in their complaints and affidavits did not constitute a sufficient showing of irreparable injury and that respondents had an adequate remedy at law . The Court of Appeals held , however : " Inasmuch as this case involves First Amendment rights of association which must be carefully guarded against infringement by public office holders , we judge that injunctive relief is clearly appropriate in these cases . " 509 F.2d , at 1136 . We agree .	@@empty@@	unmatched
At the time a preliminary injunction was sought in the District Court , one of the respondents was only threatened with discharge . In addition , many of the members of the class respondents were seeking to have certified prior to the dismissal of their complaint were threatened with discharge or had agreed to provide support for the Democratic Party in order to avoid discharge . It is clear therefore that First Amendment interests were either threatened or in fact being impaired at the time relief was sought . The loss of First Amendment freedoms , for even minimal periods of time , unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury . See New York Times Co. v. United States , 403 U.S. 713 , 91 S.Ct . 2140 , 29 L.Ed.2d 822 ( 1971 ) . 29 Since such injury was both threatened and occurring at the time of respondents ' motion and since respondents sufficiently demonstrated a probability of success on the merits , the Court of Appeals might properly have held that the District Court abused its discretion in denying preliminary injunctive relief . See Bantam Books , Inc. v. Sullivan , 372 U.S. 58 , 67 , 83 S.Ct . 631 , 637 , 9 L.Ed.2d 584 ( 1963 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Only last week , in National League of Cities v.

Constant inroads on the powers of the States to manage their own affairs can not fail to complicate our system and centralize more power in Washington . For the reasons Mr. Justice POWELL persuasively adduces , the First Amendment neither requires nor justifies such inroads in this case . In view , the issue is not so much whether the patronage system is " good " or " bad , " as the plurality characterizes the problem , but whether the choice of its use in the management of the very government of each State was not , in the words of the Tenth Amendment , " reserved to the States . . . or to the people .

Congress long ago , as a matter of policy , opted for a federal career service with a small number of purely political appointments in the executive branch , and many governmental departments have a limited number of positions in which the persons appointed have no tenure but serve at the pleasure of the cabinet officer or agency chief , who in turn serves at the pleasure of the President . See , E. g. , Leonard v. Douglas , 116 U.S.App . D.C. 136 , 321 F.2d 749 ( 1963 ) . The considerations leading to these legislative conclusions are for me not open to judicial scrutiny under the guise of a First Amendment claim , any more than is the right of a newly elected Representative or Senator , for example , to have a staff made up of persons who share his political philosophy and affiliation and are loyal to him .

As the plurality opinion recognizes , patronage practices of the sort under consideration here have a long history in America . 1 Although an extensive recounting of that history is not necessary , I think it important to survey it more fully than does the plurality opinion . 2 The observation that patronage iemployment received its primary popularization and legitimation during Jackson 's Presidency , Ante , at 353 , understates the historical antecedents of the practice , which stretch back to Washington 's presidency .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Partisan politics , as we now know them , did not assume a prominent role in national politics immediately after the adoption of the Constitution . Nonetheless , Washington tended to confine appointments even of customs officials and postmasters to Federalists , as opposed to anti - Federalists . As the role of parties expanded , partisan considerations quickly influenced employment decisions . John Adams removed some Republicans from minor posts , and Jefferson , the first President to succeed a President of an opposing party , made significant patronage use of the appointment and removal powers . The administrations of Madison , Monroe , and John Quincy Adams provided no occasion for conspicuous patronage practice in employment , as each succeeded a copartisan . Jackson , of course , used patronage extensively when he became the first President since Jefferson to succeed an antagonistic administration .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It thus appears that patronage employment practices emerged on the national level at an early date , and that they were conspicuous during Jackson 's Presidency largely because of their necessary dormancy during the long succession of Republican Presidents . During that period , however , patronage in hiring was practiced widely in the States , especially in New York and Pennsylvania . This afforded a theoretical and popular legitimacy to patronage , helping to lay the groundwork for acceptance of Jackson 's actions on the national level .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It irecognized that patronage in employment played a significant role in democratizing American politics . See , E. g. , C. Fish , The Civil Service and the Patronage 156 - 157 ( 1905 ) ; Sorauf , Patronage and Party , 3 Midwest J. Pol . Sci . 115 - 116 ( 1959 ) . Before patronage practices developed fully , an " aristocratic " class dominated political affairs , a tendency that persisted in areas where patronage did not become prevalent . C. Fish , Supra , at 157 . Patronage practices broadened the base of political participation by providing incentives to take part in the process , thereby increasing the volume of political discourse in society . Patronage also strengthened parties , and hence encouraged the development of institutional responsibility to the electorate on a permanent basis . Parties became " instrument(s ) through which discipline and responsibility may be achieved within the Leviathan . " Sorauf , Supra , at 115 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In many situations patronage employment practices also entailed costs to government efficiency . These costs led eventually to reforms placing most federal and state civil service employment on a nonpatronage basis . But the course of such reform is of limited relevance to the task of constitutional adjudication in this case . It is pertinent to note , however , that a perceived impingement on employees ' political beliefs by the patronage system was not a significant impetus to such reform . Most advocates of reform were concerned primarily with the corruption and inefficiency that patronage was thought to induce in civil service and the power that patronage practices were thought to give the " professional " politicians who relied on them . D. Rosenbloom , Federal Service and the Constitution 70 - 74 ( 1971 ) . Moreover , it generally was thought that elimination of these evils required the imposition both of a merit system and of restrictions on First Amendment activities by government employees . Id. , at 76 - 77 , 82 - 86 ; see , e. g. , CSC v. Letter Carriers , 413 U.S. 548 , 93 S.Ct . 2880 , 37 L.Ed.2d 796 ( 1973 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It might well be possible to dispose of this case on the ground that it implicates no First Amendment right of the respondents , and therefore that they have failed to state a cause of action . They are employees seeking to avoid discharge not citizens desiring an opportunity to be hired by the county without regard to their political affiliation or loyalty . Respondents ' complaint acknowledges the longstanding existence of the patronage system they now challenge :	@@empty@@	unmatched
" For many years past and continuing to this time it has been the practice of the elected Sheriff of Cook County , when he assumes office from a Sheriff of a different political party , to replace all or substantially all of the non - civil service employees of the Sheriff 's office who did not ( a ) Pledge their political allegiance to the political party of the incoming Sheriff ; ( and/or meet other specified political requirements ) . . . . " App . p. 3 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We thus have complaining employees who apparently accepted patronage jobs knowingly and willingly , while fully familiar with the " tenure " practices long prevailing in the Sheriff 's Office . Such employees have Benefited from their political beliefs and activities ; they have not been penalized for them . In these circumstances , I am inclined to agree with the holding of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in American Federation of State Employees v. Shapp , 443 Pa. 527 , 280 A.2d 375 ( 1971 ) , that beneficiaries of a patronage system may not be heard to challenge it when it comes their turn to be replaced . See also Nunnery v.

The plurality opinion virtually ignores this issue in an apparent rush to constitutional adjudication . It also may be that the pleadings present an inadequate record on which to decide this matter . 3 In any event , I am forced to turn to the question addressed by the plurality , even though a full development of the evidence or more carefully drawn pleadings may have justified a disposition on the ground that these respondents can not challenge the patronage hiring practices . 4	@@empty@@	unmatched
The question is whether it is consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments for a State to offer some employment conditioned , explicitly or implicitly , on partisan political affiliation and on the political fortunes of the incumbent officeholder . This is to be determined , as the plurality opinion agrees , by whether patronage hiring practices sufficiently advance important state interests to justify the consequent burdening of First Amendment interests . Buckley v. Valeo , 424 U.S. 1 , 25 , 96 S.Ct . 612 , 637 - 638 , 46 L.Ed.2d 659 ( 1976 ) ; Ante , at 360 - 363 . It is difficult to disagree with the view , as an abstract proposition , that government employment ordinarily should not be conditioned upon one 's political beliefs or activities . But we deal here with a highly practical and rather fundamental element of our political system , not the theoretical abstractions of a political science seminar . In concluding that patronage hiring practices are unconstitutional , the plurality seriously underestimates the strength of the government interest especially at the local level in allowing some patronage hiring practices , and it exaggerates the perceived burden on First Amendment rights . 5	@@empty@@	unmatched
* As indicated above , patronage hiring practices have contributed to American democracy by stimulating political activity and by strengthening parties , thereby helping to make government accountable . 6 It can not be questioned seriously that these contributions promote important state interests .

Without analysis , however , the plurality opinion disparages the contribution of patronage hiring practices in advancing these state interests . It merely asserts that such practices cause the " free functioning of the electoral process ( to suffer ) , " Ante , at 356 , and that " we are not persuaded that the elimination of . . . patronage dismissals , will bring about the demise of party politics . " Ante , at 369 . One can not avoid the impression , however , that even a threatened demise of parties would not trouble the plurality . In my view , this thinking reflects a disturbing insensitivity to the political realities relevant to the disposition of this case . 7	@@empty@@	unmatched
The complaining parties are or were employees of the Sheriff . In many communities , the sheriff 's duties are as routine as process serving , and his election attracts little or no general public interest . In the States , and especially in the thousands of local communities , there are large numbers of elective offices , and many are as relatively obscure as that of the local sheriff or constable . Despite the importance of elective offices to the ongoing work of local governments , election campaigns for lesser offices in particular usually attract little attention from the media , with consequent disinterest and absence of intelligent participation on the part of the public . Unless the candidates for these offices are able to dispense the traditional patronage that has accrued to the offices , they also are unlikely to attract donations of time or money from voluntary groups . In short , the resource pools that fuel the intensity of political interest and debate in " important " elections frequently " could care less " about who fills the offices deemed to be relatively unimportant . Long experience teaches that at this local level traditional patronage practices contribute significantly to the democratic process . The candidates for these offices derive their support at the precinct level , and their modest funding for publicity , from cadres of friends and political associates who hope to benefit if their " man " is elected . 8 The activities of the latter are often the principal source of political information for the voting public . The " robust " political discourse that the plurality opinion properly emphasizes is furthered not restricted by the time - honored system .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Patronage hiring practices also enable party organizations to persist and function at the local level . Such organizations become visible to the electorate at large only at election time , but the dull periods between elections require ongoing activities : precinct organizations must be maintained ; new voters registered ; and minor political " chores " performed for citizens who otherwise may have no practical means of access to officeholders . In some communities , party organizations and clubs also render helpful social services .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is naive to think that these types of political activities are motivated at these levels by some academic interest in " democracy " or other public service impulse . For the most part , as every politician knows , the hope of some reward generates a major portion of the local political activity supporting parties . It is difficult to overestimate the contributions to our system by the major political parties , fortunately limited in number compared to the fractionalization that has made the continued existence of democratic government doubtful in some other countries . Parties generally are stable , high - profile , and permanent institutions . When the names on a long ballot are meaningless to the average voter , party affiliation affords a guidepost by which voters may rationalize a myriad of political choices . Cf . Buckley v. Valeo , 424 U.S. , at 66 - 68 , 96 S.Ct . , at 657 - 658 . Voters can and do hold parties to long - term accountability , and it is not too much to say that , in their absence , responsive and responsible performance in low - profile offices , particularly , is difficult to maintain .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is against decades of experience to the contrary , then , that the plurality opinion concludes that patronage hiring practices interfere with the " free functioning of the electoral process . " Ante , at 356 . This ad hoc judicial judgment runs counter to the judgments of the representatives of the people in state and local governments , representatives who have chosen , in most instances , to retain some patronage practices in combination with a merit - oriented civil service . One would think that elected representatives of the people are better equipped than we to weigh the need for some continuation of patronage practices in light of the interests above identified , 9 and particularly in view of local conditions . 10 See CSC v. Letter Carriers , 413 U.S. , at 564 , 93 S.Ct . , at 2889 - 2890 ; United Public Workers v. Mitchell , 330 U.S. 75 , 99 , 67 S.Ct . 556 , 569 , 91 L.Ed . 754 ( 1947 ) . Against this background , the assertion in the plurality opinion that " ( p)atronage dismissals . . . are not the least restrictive alternative to achieving ( any ) contribution they may make to the democratic process " is unconvincing , especially since no alternative to some continuation of patronage practices is suggested . Ante , at 369 ( footnote omitted ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
I thus conclude that patronage hiring practices sufficiently serve important state interests , including some interests sought to be advanced by the First Amendment , to justify a tolerable intrusion on the First Amendment interests of employees or potential employees .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The plurality opinion asserts that patronage hiring practices contravene the fundamental principle that " ' no official , high or petty , can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics , nationalism , religion , or other matters of opinion . . . . ' " West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette , 319 U.S. 624 , 642 , 63 S.Ct . 1178 , 1187 , 87 L.Ed . 1628 ( 1943 ) . But such practices simply can not be so construed . This case differs materially from previous cases involving the imposition of political conditions on employment , see , E. g. , Garner v. Los Angeles Board , 341 U.S. 716 , 71 S.Ct . 909 , 95 L.Ed . 1317 ( 1951 ) , cases where there was an attempt to exclude " a minority group . . . odious to the majority . " Id. , at 725 , 71 S.Ct . , at 915 ( Frankfurter , J. , concurring in part and dissenting in part ) . In that context there was a danger that governmental action was directed toward the elimination of political beliefs by penalizing adherents to them . But patronage hiring practices have been consistent historically with vigorous ideological competition in the political " marketplace . " And even after one becomes a beneficiary , the system leaves significant room for individual political expression . Employees , regardless of affiliation , may vote freely 11 and express themselves on some political issues . See Perry v. Sindermann , 408 U.S. 593 , 92 S.Ct . 2694 , 33 L.Ed.2d 570 ( 1972 ) ; Pickering v. Board of Education , 391 U.S. 563 , 88 S.Ct . 1731 , 20 L.Ed.2d 811 ( 1968 ) . The principal intrusion of patronage hiring practices on First Amendment interests thus arises from the coercion on associational choices that may be created by one 's desire initially to obtain employment . This intrusion , while not insignificant , must be measured in light of the limited role of patronage hiring in most government employment . The pressure to abandon one 's beliefs and associations to obtain government employment especially employment of such uncertain duration does not seem to me to assume impermissible proportions in light of the interests to be served .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On the assumption that we must reach the constitutional issue at the behest of respondents , I would hold that a state or local government may elect to condition employment on the political affiliation of a prospective employee and on the political fortunes of the hiring incumbent . History and long - prevailing practice across the country support the view that patronage hiring practices make a sufficiently substantial contribution to the practical functioning of our democratic system to support their relatively modest intrusion on First Amendment interests . The judgment today unnecessarily constitutionalizes another element of American life an element certainly not without its faults but one which generations have accepted on balance as having merit . 12 We should have heeded , instead , the admonition of Mr. Justice Holmes that " ( i)f a thing has been practised for two hundred years by common consent , it will need a strong case for the Fourteenth Amendment to affect it . . .

On Feb. 28 , 1879 , Robert Garrett and others filed their bill in the court below against the City of Memphis , Tennessee , setting forth that they are the owners and holders of overdue and unpaid bonds and coupons and other evidences of her indebtedness to the amount of more than $ 100,000 , upon much of which indebtedness they have secured judgments and writs of mandamus to compel the collection thereof , but that , owing to the malfeasance , misfeasance , and incompetency of her officers charged with the collection of taxes , a large proportion of those assessed and levied for many years past , and amounting to at least $ 2,500,000 , are uncollected and unpaid , by reason of which she is insolvent ; that her persistent failure to collect them is a fraud upon her creditors ; that during each of the years 1875 , 1876 , 1877 , and 1878 a large levy of taxes was made in obedience to writs of mandamus , but that by reason of her failure during each of those years to collect more than three - fifths of the amount thereof , and also of the taxes assessed and levied for general purposes , a large amount represented by the judgments remains unpaid ; that the special levies so made , in which the complainants have a large interest , constitute a trust fund for the payment of their judgments which can only be used for that purpose , and that the city 's neglect and failure to press the collection thereof is a fraud upon them , against which a court of equity will relieve ; that , outside of the power of a court to appoint a receiver to take charge of the assets of the city and collect the taxes so levied , it is , by an act of the legislature of Tennessee passed March 19 , 1877 , entitled ' An Act to enable municipal corporations having more than thirty - five thousand inhabitants to settle their indebtedness , ' being chapter 71 of the acts of 1877 , provided that upon the application of any person or persons who are the holders of any past - due and unpaid bonds , coupons , or other indebtedness , not less in amount than $ 100,000 , of any municipal corporation having more than thirty - five thousand inhabitants , it shalll be the duty of the Court of Chancery to appoint a receiver for such corporation ; that the city 's indebtedness , represented by judgments and otherwise , amounts to over $ 850,000 , and that her population exceeds thirty - five thousand persons .

Moores , former tax - collector of the city , and Joseph Uhl , clerk of the Circuit Court of Shelby County , Tennessee , all residents and citizens of that county,were made defendants . The bill , after reaffirming the averments of the original bill , charges , among other things , that the complainants , as creditors of the corporation and having valid debts against it , are not and can not be deprived of the vested rights secured to them by previous legislation ; that said chapters 10 and 11 of the acts of 1879 , so far as they attempt to impair those rights or divert the assets of the corporation from the reach or control of its creditors , are unconstitutional and void . The bill , after charging that upon the passage of said chapters 10 and 11 the mayor and other officers of the city who were charged by law with the collection of taxes , and who held the same in trust to be applied in satisfaction of the complainants ' debts , abandoned their offices and trusts and left the latter unexecuted ; that before the repeal of the charter of the city there was in the hands of certain of the defendants a large amount belonging to the special trust and mandamus funds ; and that all the property of the city , real and personal , including past - due and unpaid taxes , constitutes assets for the benefit of her creditors which should be brought in and marshalled for the payment of her debts,prays that it may be taken and considered as a general creditor 's bill for all who may come in within a time to be limited , and that a receiver be appointed and empowered and directed to take charge of all the tax books and papers of the city , and her records and books of every description , together with all the tax - books , bills and accounts for all taxes theretofore levied by her for all purposes which have not been collected and are yet due and unpaid ; that he be empowered to collect the same by distress warrants , or in any manner deemed expedient by the court , and bring or prosecute any suit or suits in any court for the collection of the same ; that , until the rights of all persons be determined , he be instructed and required to keep separate accounts of each class of taxes collected as appear on the various tax - books of the city ; that he be empowered to take charge of all money now on hand which has been collected from any source for taxes , rents , or otherwise ; that all parties be required to pay the said funds to him , of which he shall keep separate accounts , and pay the same out to the parties entitled under the order of the court ; that he be directed to take charge of all the real estate of the city of whatever description and wherever situated in which she has any interest , equitable or legal ; that he take possession of all the personal property of every kind belonging to the city at the time of her dissolution , but that , for the time being and until the rights of parties shall have been determined and some arrangements be made , the fire - engines , hose and horses , and paraphernalia of the fire department be not interfered with so as to destroy or impair its efficiency ; that when the assets are collected they be disbursed under the order of the court to the parties to whom they belong in law , or as the different parties are entitled ; that he be empowered to sell any part of said assets from time to time , or all of the same , together with such further powers and instructions as may from time to time be necessary to bring other parties before the court ; that , if the present assets are not sufficient to pay all the debts , assessments be made upon all the corporators and property in the city for any claims that may remain unpaid of said debts , whether due or not , and that judgments be rendered against said parties for amounts found due ; that such accounts be taken to ascertain the amounts of debts as may be deemed expedient , and complainants ' debts paid .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Thereupon the complainants , April 10 , 1879 , filed in the consolidated causes an amended and supplemental bill , to which Meriwether , William F. Hardin , Joseph R. Williams , and John B. Hill were , in addition to the persons mentioned in the original and amended bills , made defendants . This bill , after stating the filing of the original and amended bills by the various complainants , alleging the contents thereof , the failure of the defendants to either plead , answer , or demur thereto , the appointment of Latham as receiver , the execution of his bond , and his entry upon the duties of that office , and charging that said Meriwether , as receiver and back - tax collector , is interfering with said Latham as receiver of the court , and is impeding him in the collection of back taxes , and discouraging and preventing payments to him ; that the defendants , Hardin , Williams , and Hill , who are citizens of and residents in the city of Memphis , although indebted to it for taxes long overdue and unpaid , refuse to pay them to said Latham as receiver , prays that an injunction may issue restraining said Meriwether , his agents and attorneys , and each of them , from demanding , taking possesson of , recovering , collecting or attempting to collect , or in any way interfering with the assets and property , real , personal , or mixed , or choses in action , of the city of Memphis , including the debts due to her , taxes of every description heretofore assessed and levied by or for her , and the evidences of such assets , property , debts , and taxes , consisting of deeds , bonds , bills , notes , accounts , books of assessment , tax - books and other books , and writings of every description , having reference to such property , assets , debts , taxes , or any part thereof ; and from instituting or prosecuting any suits or actions of any kind whatever in any court against the said Latham , as such receiver as aforesaid , or against any other person or persons , for the recovery of any part of the assets or property , debts , taxes aforesaid , or any tax - books , assessment - books , or other books or writings of any kind having connection therewith or reference thereto or to any part thereof ; and from doing any act or thing , and from making or publishing in any manner whatsoever any declaration or notice , printed , written , or verbal , asserting or tending to assert that the right to the property or custody or control of the said assets or debts or taxes of the city of Memphis , or property of any kind thereof , or to collect or receive the same , is rightfully in him , the said Meriwether , or is not in the said Latham , as such receiver , or tending to persuade or advise , prevent , hinder , or deter the persons owing debts or taxes to the city of Memphis from paying the same to the said Latham , as such receiver ; that an account may be taken as to the amount of taxes or debts due from each and every of the said defendants , Hardin , Williams , and Hill , and the particular lot or lots of land upon which the said taxes were assessed and levied , and upon which they constitute a lien , and the amount due and owing by them to the city of Memphis on account of past - due taxes or on any other account ; that the complainants may be subrogated to all the rights , claims , and liens of the said city of Memphis against the said defendants severally ; and that the lien which the said defendant , the city of Memphis , held or holds against or on the several lots and parcels of land aforesaid , on account of said taxes assessed and levied thereon , may be declared and fixed by decree for the benefit of the complainants and other creditors in like attitude , and that personal decrees be also rendered against each of said defendants for the amount found due from them on the taking of the said accounts for the benefit of complainants ; and that unless said defendants shall severally pay into the registry of this court by a day fixed the amounts so found due from them on the claims aforesaid , that then the court decree that said several parcels or lots of land be sold to satisfy the amounts so found due on account of each as liens thereon , and in order that all equity of redemption or repurchase shall be cut off and for ever barred ; that the said lots be sold on a credit of seven months , and barring all right of redemption , and the proceeds when realized be applied to the payment of the complainants ' claims herein , and other creditors in like attitude who may come in and be made parties hereto .	@@empty@@	unmatched

The presiding judge being of opinion that the demurrers were not well taken , they were overruled , whereupon , the defendants electing to abide thereby , the court , May 28 , 1879 , decreed that the complainants , and the other creditors who had made themselves parties under the leave of the court , and such others as might so make themselves parties , do have and recover of and from the city of Memphis the several debts due them respectively , the amounts of which would be fixed by the court , and that all the assets and property of every description theretofore belonging to the city of Memphis , or so much thereof as may be necessary for the purpose , including taxes heretofore assessed and remaining unpaid and due the city , be applied to the payment of such debts ; to which end said Latham , as receiver , was directed to retain possession of all the assets and property , books , papers , and writings , placed in his hands to be disposed of only as the court might order in the progress of the suit , and that he collect the said assets and property in the manner directed by the former orders for the payment of the said debts . The court further decreed that the defendant , Minor Meriwether , as receiver and tax - collector , be perpetually enjoined from taking possession of , collecting , or attempting to collect , suing for , or in any way interfering with , said assets , property books , papers , and writings , so in the possession of or to be collected by said Latham as such receiver ; that all the property within the limits of the territory of the city of Memphis is liable and may be subjected to the payment of all the debts aforesaid owing by said city , and that such liability shall be enforced thereafter from time to time in such manner as the court might order and direct ; that Latham , the receiver aforesaid , recover of the defendant Williams the sum of $ 6,843.46 , of the defendant Hardin the sum of $ 954.85 , and of the defendant Hill the sum of $ 6,638.38 , being the amount of taxes due by them respectively to the city of Memphis ; that executions issue on the said several decrees , the right being reserved to enforce all liens that might exist on any and all property for the payment of the said sums or any part thereof .	@@empty@@	unmatched

MR . CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE announced the conclusions reached by the court as follows:	@@empty@@	unmatched
1 . Property held for public uses , such as public buildings , streets , squares , parks , promenades , wharves , landing - places , fire - engines , hose and hose - carriages , engine - houses , engineering instruments , and generally everything held for governmental purposes , can not be subjected to the payment of the debts of the city . Its public character forbids such an appropriation . Upon the repeal of the charter of the city , such property passed under the immediate control of the State , the power once delegated to the city in that behalf having been withdrawn .	@@empty@@	unmatched
2 . The private property of individuals within the limits of the territory of the city can not be subjected to the payment of the debts of the city , except through taxation . The doctrine of some of the States , that such property can be reached directly on execution against the municipality , has not been generally accepted .	@@empty@@	unmatched
3 . The power of taxation is legislative , and can not be exercised otherwise than under the authority of the legislature .	@@empty@@	unmatched
4 . Taxes levied according to law before the repeal of the charter , other than such as were levied in obedience to the special requirement of contracts entered into under the authority of law , and such as were levied under judicial direction for the payment of judgments recovered against the city , can not be collected through the instrumentality of a court of chancery at the instance of the creditors of the city . Such taxes can only be collected under authority from the legislature . If no such authority exists , the remedy is by appeal to the legislature , which alone can grant relief . Whether taxes levied in obedience to contract obligations , or under judicial direction , can be collected through a receiver appointed by a court of chancery , if there be no public officer charged with authority from the legislature to perform that duty , is not decided , as the case does not require it .	@@empty@@	unmatched
5 . The receiver and back - tax collector appointed under the authority of the act of March 13 , 1879 , is a public officer , clothed with authority from the legislature for the collection of the taxes levied before the repeal of the charter . The funds collected by him from taxes levied under judicial direction can not be appropriated to any other uses than those for which they were raised . He , as well as any other agent of the State charged with the duty of their collection , can be compelled by appropriate judicial orders to proceed with the collection of such taxes by sale of property or by suit or in any other way authorized by law , and to apply the proceeds upon the judgments .	@@empty@@	unmatched
6 . The bills in this case can not be amended so as to obtain relief against the receiver and back - tax collector , without making an entirely new suit . They were not framed with a view to any such purpose .	@@empty@@	unmatched

8 . The cause is remanded , with instructions to dismiss the bills , without prejudice .

Mr. Justice Miller , Mr. Justice Bradley , and myself concur in the judgment rendered , but , as the judgment is not accompanied by a statement of the reasons on which it is founded , I proceed to state those which have controlled us .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In January , 1879 , the city of Memphis , in the State of Tennessee , was financially in a bad condition . She had been for many years a municipal corporation , and was invested with the ordinary powers of such bodies to make contracts and incur obligations for municipal purposes , and to levy and collect taxes to meet her expenditures . Her authorities were also at different times specially empowered by the legislature of the State to subscribe for stock in railroad corporations , to aid in the construction of lines of railway leading to and from the city , and to issue interest - bearing bonds for the amount subscribed ; also to issue bonds of like character to raise the means to erect water - works , construct pavements , and make ' any public improvements ' that might be necessary , and to acquire property for the public use of the city . Indeed , the powers conferred at various times upon the authorities to undertake public works , and engage in enterprises for the benefit of the city , were as large as the supposed necessities of a municipality with great expectations of future growth could suggest ; and these powers appear to have been exercised with a liberality proportionate to the expectations . Texas were levied to meet the consequent expenditures of the city and the interest on her bonds , but these were not always enforced with the readiness with which the obligations were incurred .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The record shows that for several years preceding 1879 not more than three - fifths of the annual taxes were collected . Whether this arose from the viciousness of the system of taxation adopted , or the inefficiency of the officers of collection , is immaterial . Probably it arose partly from both causes . The natural result followed : the revenues received became insufficient to meet the just claims of creditors ; obligations were not paid as they matured ; coupons for interest on bonds were not provided for ; the city was in default for much of the principal and all of the interest of her indebtedness : she was insolvent . Suits were soon commenced against her by creditors : some in the Federal courts , some in the State courts ; and fron the Federal courts in several cases a mandamus was issued to the authorities of the city to levy a special tax for the payment of judgments recovered . With taxes uncollected , debts maturing , and both principal and interest unprovided for ; with numerous suits commenced and more threatened ; with credit gone and the property of her citizens already subjected to burdens difficult to be borne , the city was in a condition out of which she was almost helpless to extricate herself .	@@empty@@	unmatched
While the city was thus burdened with debts and pursued by creditors , the State interfered ; and on the 29th of January , 1879 , repealed the charter of the city , took the immediate control and custody of her public property , and afterwards assumed the collection of the taxes levied , and their application to the payment of her indebtedness .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The repealing act was in terms general , and applied to all municipal corporations in the State having thirty - five thousand inhabitants at the date of its passage , to be ascertained by the governor , and declared by his proclamation . The city of Memphis had that number of inhabitants ; and it was so proclaimed by the governor . The act not only repealed the charters of all such corporations , with their amendments , but declared that all municipal offices , held under them , were abolished ; that the population within their territorial limits were resolved back into the body of the State ; that all power of taxation in any form previously invested in their authorities was withdrawn and reserved to the legislature ; and that the public buildings , squares , promenades , wharves , streets , alleys , parks , fire - engines , hose and carriages , engine - houses , engineer instruments , and all other property , real and personal , previously used for municipal purposes , were transferred to the custody and control of the State , to remain public property as previously it always had been .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On the same day with the passage of the repealing act , the legislature passed another act to establish taxing districts in the State , and to provide the means for their local government . It declared that the several communities embraced in the territorial limits of the repealed corporations , and of such other corporations as might surrender their charters under the act , were created taxing districts in order to provide the means of local government for their peace , safety , and general welfare ; that the necessary taxes for the support of the governments thus established should be imposed directly by the General Assembly , and not otherwise ; that in administering the affairs and providing the means of local government the following agencies and instrumentalities were established , namely , a board of fire and police commissioners ; a committee on ordinances or local laws , to be known as the legislative council of the taxing district ; a board of health , and a board of public works ; and it prescribed in detail the duties and powers of these local agencies . The act prohibited the commissioners from issuing any bonds , notes , scrip , or other evidences of indebtedness , or from contracting for work , material , or services in excess of the amount levied for them for that year ; and declared that no property , real or personal , held by them for public use should ever be subject to execution , attachment , or seizure under any legal process for any debt created by them ; that all taxes due , or moneys in the hands of the county trustee , or on deposit , should be exempt from seizure under attachment , execution , garnishment , or other legal process . It also declared that no writ of mandamus or other process should lie to compel them or other governing agencies to levy any taxes , and that neither the commissioners , nor trustee , nor the local government should be held to pay or be liable for any debt creatged by the extinct corporations , and that none of the taxes collected under the act should ever be used for the payment of any of said debts . The act also declared that all the property previously used by the corporations for purposes of government was transferred to the custody and control of the board of commissioners of the taxing districts , to remain public property for the uses to which it had previously been applied , and that all indebtedness for taxes or otherwise , whether in litigation or not , due to the extinct municipalities , should vest in and become the property of the State , to be disposed of for the settlement of their debts as should thereafter be provided by law .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On the 13th of March following such provision was made . By an act passed by the legislature on that day , the governor was directed to appoint an officer for municipal corporations , whose charters had been repealed under the first act mentioned , or might be subsequently surrendered , to be known as a receiver and back - tax collector . It required him to take possession of all books , papers , and documents pertaining to the assessment and collection of taxes , which had been levied at the time of the repeal of the charters . It ordered him to file a bill in the Chancery Court of the county in which the corporation was situated , in the name of the State , in behalf of all creditors against all its delinquent tax - payers , and provided that taxes assessed prior to 1875 might be settled in the valid indebtedness of the extinct municipality , whether due or not , and that the receiver should receive evidences of such indebtedness at certain designated rates . It also prohibited him from coercing payment of a greater sum than one - fifth of the taxes in arrears annually , so as to distribute the whole through five equal annual instalments , commencing from his appointment and qualification . It authorized the Chancery Court to enforce all liens upon property for the payment of taxes , and to order all sales necessary for their collection ; and to settle and adjust all equities , priorities , and liens ; and to give to the defendants and creditors all the relief which might be given if there were as many separate suits as there were creditors and delinquent tax - payers . It provided that the taxes as collected should be paid into the State treasury , and be paid out to parties entitled to receive them , as adjudged by the Chancery Court , upon the warrant of the receiver , countersigned by the Chancellor . It required the receiver , in paying the money collected into the treasury , to distinguish the sources whence it was derived , showing the amount from each special and general tax , so that they might be kept separate , and be paid out to creditors according to the priority , lien , or equity determined . The act was accompanied with a proviso that it should not interfere with any vested rights entitling parties to a speedy collection . On the passage of the repealing act there was a large amount of uncollected taxes , which had been levied upon property in the city of Memphis , such as taxes to pay certain specified creditors under writs of mandamus , a special tax to pay interest upon bonds , a special sinking - fund tax , a school tax , a wharfage tax , a tax upon merchants to pay police and firemen , a tax to pay interest upon bonds issued to certain railroads , and a tax for general purposes of government . Under the provisions of the act of March 13 , the defendant , Minor Meriwether , was appointed by the governor receiver and back - tax collector of that city . He accepted the appointment , and proceeded at once to the performance of his duties .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The day previous to the passage of the act repealing the charter of Memphis , and probably in anticipation of the contemplated legislation of the State , Robert Garrett and others , creditors of the corporation , filed a bill against the city , alleging in substance that the city owed them over $ 100,000 , upon much of which they had recovered judgments and obtained writs of mandamus to compel the levy of taxes for their payment ; that various writs of mandamus had been issued against the city for over $ 850,000 ; that through the malfeasance and incompetency of its officials only about three - fifths of the taxes imposed had been collected , and that this practice had run through a series of years , resulting in delinquent taxes of about $ 2,500,000 ; that the taxes levied , pursuant to the writs of mandamus issued , constituted a trust fund which could only be used for the same , and , although requested to press the collection , had neglected to do so , and quested to press the collection , had neglected to do so , and that this neglect was a fraud on the complainants relievable in a court of equity .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It also set up that the legislature , by an act of the 19th of March , 1877 , had authorized the Chancery Court of the State to appoint a receiver to take charge of the affairs of the city , upon application of creditors owning demands against her exceeding $ 100,000 , when it was made to appear that writs of mandamus had been issued against her to enforce debts against the city amounting to over $ 850,000 ; and averring that the court had jurisdiction , both upon general principles of jurisprudence and by authority of that act , the bill prayed the appointment of a receiver to take charge of the assets of the city , including its tax - books and bills for unpaid taxes , and to collect the taxes levied , for the purpose of paying the judgments .	@@empty@@	unmatched
After the repealing act was passed , the complainants filed a supplementary bill setting up the passage of the act , alleging its invalidity , and repeating its prayer for the appointment of a receiver .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Subsequently several other parties instituted like suits against the city . All the suits were , in February , 1879 , consolidated into one without objection , and by amendment to it , in April following , Meriwether , the receiver appointed by the governor , was made a defendant , as also sundry parties upon whose property taxes had been levied . With the consolidation a receiver of the assets and property of the city was appointed to hold and dispose of the same under the direction of the court ; and he immediately qualified , and proceeded to take possession , so far as practicable , of the property and assets , and to exercise the powers with which he was invested .	@@empty@@	unmatched
To the bill as consolidated and amended a demurrer was interposed by the defendants , upon which several questions arose , on which the judges of the Circuit Court were divided in opinion . The prevailing opinion of the presiding judge being against the demurrer , it was overruled , and the defendants electing to stand upon it , judgment final was rendered in favor of the complainants , from which the defendants have appealed to this court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The receiver appointed by the court was invested with larger powers than probably any officer of a court was ever before intrusted with . He was required to demand , receive , and take possession of all the assets and property of the city of Memphis , including real and personal property , and debts due to it and taxes which had been previously levied , except the taxes appearing on the tax - books for the year 1878 , for which special provision was made ; and except , also , the public highways of the city , the public squares , the public landings and wharves , the hospital , and certain property used in connection with it , and property of the fire , engineer , and police departments , and the taxes levied for the support of the public schools , which excepted articles he was not to take possession of or interfere with until the further order of the court . It does not appear that the court entertained any doubt that it could at some future time place all this public property in the hands of its receiver , as its subsequent decree shows . The receiver was also required to take possession of all the tax - books of the city on which unpaid taxes were charged , except the tax - books for the year 1878 ; and also all the safes , books , papers , desks , office furniture , and other property belonging to the offices of mayor , comptroller , register , treasurer , tax - collector , inspector , and city attorney , necessary to the discharge of his duties as receiver , and of the buildings in which the general council of the city had previously assembled , and the property in and belonging to such buildings not previously excepted , and keep them subject to the order of the court ; and parties having possession or control of such property , or any part of it , were required to surrender the same to him on demand .	@@empty@@	unmatched
By the order appointing the receiver , the trustee of Shelby County , within which the city of Memphis is situated , was required to pay over to him all the moneys he had on hand collected for taxes levied by the city for the year 1878 , except such as were levied for the support of public schools . The former treasurer of the city was also required , with the like exception , to turn over to the receiver , on demand , all the money in his hands or on deposit in the German National Bank , received for the city . The mayor of the city was also to pay over to him any money , and deliver to him any property , belonging to the city , and the papers and vouchers necessary for the discharge of the receiver 's duties ; and the clerk of the county of Shelby was also to pay over any moneys received by him on account of the redemption of property sold for taxes due the city . The receiver was also required to lease the property of which he might have possession from month to month , and to collect the rents and hold the same subject to the order of the court ; and , if he found it necessary , he was authorized to bring actions at law or suits in equity against parties indebted to the city , or for any tax or taxes appearing on the tax - books , and to enforce any specific liens on the property , real or personal , for the payment of such taxes ; and to employ as many clerks and assistants as he might deem necessary ; to make use of the buildings and offices in the city hall , and of such safes , desks , tables , chairs , and other furniture and property of the city he might need ; to buy and pay for necessary books , stationery , fuel , and lights , and whatever else might be necessary to fit his office or offices for use to enable him to discharge his duties ; to insure any property , real or personal , which might come into his hands , when he thought prudent to do so ; to employ one or more attorneys , if necessary , to conduct the prosecution of defence of suits that he might find necessary to bring or defend under the authority conferred by him . Other powers were also vested in the receiver , but what has already been said is enough to show the extraordinary character of those conferred and of the duties imposed upon him . He was , in fact , invested with the administration of the financial affairs of the city , so far as might be necessary for the collection of taxes and debts and disposing of the property of the city to pay the claims of creditors . Executive and administrative functions were invested in him which , it has not been supposed , could adequately be performed by the same person in any government of a city properly conducted .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The decree adjudged that the complainants in the several suits , and other creditors who had made themselves parties by leave of the court , or who might thereafter make themselves parties , should recover from the city the several debts due them respectively , the amounts to be thereafter fixed by the court , and that all the assets and property of the city , ' of every description , ' or so much thereof as might be necessary for that purpose , including taxes previously assessed and remaining unpaid and due the city , should be applied to the payment of their debts . The decree also adjudged that the receiver should retain possession of all the assets and property , books , papers , and writings previously placed in his hands to be disposed of as the court might order in the progress of the suit , and that he proceed to collect the assets and property in the manner directed by previous orders for the payment of the debts . It also enjoined the defendant , Minor Meriwether , the receiver and back - tax collector appointed by the governor of the State , from taking possession of , collecting , or attempting to collect , suing for , or in any way interfering with , the assets and property , books , papers , and writings in the possession of the receiver of the court . And the decree further adjudged that all the property within the limits of the territory of the city of Memphis was liable and might be subjected to the payment of all the debts of the city , and that such liability would be enforced thereafter , from time to time , in such manner as the court might direct .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This decree is manifestly erroneous in its main provisions . It proceeds upon the theory that the property of every description held by the municipality at the time of its extinction , whether held in its own right or for public uses , including also in that designation its uncollected taxes , were chargeable with the payment of its debts , and constituted a trust fund , of which the Circuit Court would take possession and enforce the trust ; and that the private property of the inhabitants of the city was also liable , and could be subjected by the Circuit Court to the payment of its debts . In both particulars the theory is radically wrong .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The right of the State to repeal the charter of Memphis can not be questioned . Municipal corporations are mere instrumentalities of the State for the more convenient administration of local government . Their powers are such as the legislature may confer , and these may be enlarged , abridged , or entirely withdrawn at its pleasure . This is learing , found in all adjudications on the subject of municipal bodies and repeated by text - writers . There is no contract between the State and the public that the charter of a city shall not be at all times subject to legislative control . All persons who deal with such bodies are conclusively presumed to act upon knowledge of the power of the legislature . There is no such thing as a vested right held by any individual in the grant of legislative power to them . United States v. Railroad Co. , Commissioners v. Lucas , Treasurer , 93 U. S. 108 ; People v. Morris , 13 Wend . ( N. Y. ) 325 ; Philadelphia v. Fox , 64 Pa. St. 169 ; Montpelier v. East Montpelier , 29 Vt . 12 ; Angell & Ames , Corp. ( 10th ed . ) , sect . 31 ; Dill . Mun . Corp. , sect . 30 ; Cooley , Const . Lim . 192 , 193 . By the repeal the legislative powers previously possessed by the corporation of Memphis reverted to the State . A portion of them the State immediately vested in the new government of the taxing district , with many restrictions on the creation of indebtedness . A portion of them the State retained ; it reserved to the legislature all power of taxation . It thus provided against future claims from the improvidence or recklessness of the new government . The power of the State to make this change of local government is incontrovertible . Its subsequent provision for the collection of the taxes of the corporation levied before the repeal of its charter , and the appropriation of the proceeds to the payment of its debts , remove from the measure any imputation that it was designed to enable the city to escape from its just liabilities .	@@empty@@	unmatched
But while the charter of a municipal corporation may be repealed at the pleasure of the legislature , where there is no inhibition to its action in the Constitution of the State , the lawful contracts of the corporation , made whilst it was in existence , may be subsequently enforced against property held by it , in its own right , as hereafter described , at the time of the repeal . In this respect its position is not materially different from that of a private individual , whose property must , upon his decease , go to the satisfaction of his debts before those who succeed to his rights can share in its distribution . The language used by us in the case of Broughton v. Pensacola on this subject is quoted by counsel , under the impression that it tends to sustain the position of the complainants . We there said:	@@empty@@	unmatched
' The ancient doctrine that , upon the repeal of a private corporation , its debts were extinguished , and its real property reverted to its grantors , and its personal property vested in the State , has been so far modified by modern adjudications that a court of equity will now lay hold of the property of a dissolved corporation , and administer it for the benefit of its creditors and stockholders . The obligation of contracts , made whilst the corporation was in existence , survives its dissolution , and the contracts may be enforced by a court of equity , so far as to subject , for their satisfaction , any property possessed by the corporation at the time . In the view of equity , its property constitutes a trust fund , pledged to the payment of the debts of creditors and stockholders ; and if a municipal corporation , upon the surrender or extinction in other ways of its charter , is possessed of any property , a court of equity will equally take possession of it for the benefit of the creditors of the corporation . ' 93 U. S. 266 , 268 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We approve of the doctrine stated in this citation . It expresses what we believe to be sound law . It means that whatever property a municipal corporation holds subject to the payment of its debts , will , after its dissolution , be so administered and applied by a court of equity . It does not undertake to determine what is to be deemed the property of a municipal corporation , which , after the extinction of its charter , is thus applicable . In the case from which it is taken , the bill alleged that the city of Pensacola , upon the surrender of its charter , did not possess any property , and , of course , the question here raised could not have been before the court . The question there was as to the continuation of the city 's liability under a new organization .	@@empty@@	unmatched
What , then , is the property of a municipal corporation , which , upon its dissolution , a court of equity will lay hold of and apply to the payment of its debts ? We answer , first , that it is not property held by the corporation in trust for a private charity , for in such property the corporation possesses no interest for its own uses ; and , secondly , that it is not property held in trust for the public , for of such property the corporation is the mere agent of the State . In its streets , wharves , cemeteries , hospitals , court - houses , and other public buildings , the corporation has no proprietary rights distinct from the trust for the public . It holds them for public use , and to no other use can they be appropriated without special legislative sanction . It would be a perversion of that trust to apply them to other uses . The courts can have nothing to do with them , unless appealed to on behalf of the public to prevent their diversion from the public use . The dissolution of the charter does not divest the trust so as to subject property of this kind to a liability from which it was previously exempt . Upon the dissolution , the property passes under the immediate control of the State , the agency of the corporation then ceasing . 2 Dillon , Mun . Corp. , sects . 445 , 446 ; Schaffer v. Cadwallader , 36 Pa. St. 126 ; City of Davenport v. Peoria Marine & Fire Insurance Co. , 17 Iowa , 276 ; Askins v. Commonwealth , 1 Duv . ( Ky. ) 275 ; The President , & c. v. City of Indianapolis , 12 Ind. 620 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In the third place , we say that taxes previously levied , but not collected on the dissolution of the corporation , do not constitute its property ; and in the absence of statutory authority they can not be subsequently collected by a court of equity through officers of its own appointment , and applied to the payment of the creditors of the corporation . Taxes are not debts . It was so held by this court in the case of Oregon v. Lane County , reported in 7th Wallace . Debts are obligations for the payment of money founded upon contract , express or implied . Taxes are imposts levied for the support of the government , or for some special purpose authorized by it . The consent of the tax - payer is not necessary to their enforcement . They operate in invitum . Nor is their nature affected by the fact that in some Statesand we believe in Tennesseean action of debt may be instituted for their recovery . The form of procedure can not change their character . City of Augusta v. North , 57 Me . 392 ; City of Camden v. Allen , 2 Dutch . ( N. J. ) 398 ; Perry v. Washburn , 20 Cal . 318 . Nor are they different when levied under writs of mandamus for the payment of judgments , and when levied for the same purpose by statute . The levy in the one case is as much by legislative authority as in the other . The writs of manamus only require the officers of assessment and collection to obey existing law . In neither case are the taxes liens upon property unless made so by statute . Philadelphia v. Greble , 38 Pa. St. 339 ; Howell v. Philadelphia , i d . 471 ; 2 Dillon , Mun . Corp. , sect . 659 . Levied only by authority of the legislature , they can be altered , postponed , or released at its pleasure . A repeal of the law , under which a tax is levied , at any time before the tax is collected , generally puts an end to the tax , unless provision for its continuance is made in the repealing act , though the tax may be revived and enforced by subsequent legislation . We say generally , for there are some exceptions , where the tax provided is so connected with a contract , as the inducement for its execution , that the courts will hold the repeal of the law to be invalid as impairing the obligation of the contract . It is not of such taxes , constituting the consideration of contracts , that we are speaking , but of ordinary taxes authorized for the support of government , or to meet some special expenditure ; and these , until collected , being mere imposts of the government , created and continuing only by the will of the legislature,have none of the elements of property which can be seized like debts by attachment or other judicial process and subjected to the payment of creditors of the dissolved corporation . They are in no proper sense of the term assets of the corporation . They are only the means provided for obtaining funds to support its government and pay its debts , and disappear as such means with the revocation of the charter , except as the legislature may otherwise provide . When they are collected , the moneys in the hands of the collecting officer may be controlled by the process of the courts , and applied by their direction to the uses for which the taxes were levied ; but until then there is nothing in existence but a law of the State imposing certain charges upon persons or property , which the legislature may change , postpone , or release , at any time before they are enforced . So long as the law authorizing the tax continues in force , the courts may , by mandamus , compel the officers empowered to levy it or charged with its collection , if unmindful and neglectful in the matter , to proceed and perform their duty ; but when the law is gone , and the office of the collector abolished , there is nothing upon which the courts can act . The courts can not continue in force the taxes levied , nor levy new taxes for the payment of the debts of the corporation . The levying of taxes is not a judicial act . It has no elements of one . It is a high act of sovereignty , to be performed only by the legislature upon considerations of policy , necessity , and the public welfare . In the distribution of the powers of government in this country into three departments , the power of taxation falls to the legislative . It belongs to that department to determine what measures shall be taken for the public welfare , and to provide the revenues for the support and due administration of the government throughout the State and in all its subdivisions . Having the sole power to authorize the tax , it must equally possess the sole power to prescribe the means by which the tax shall be collected , and to designate the officers through whom its will shall be enforced .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is the province of the courts to decide causes between parties , and , in so doing , to construe the Constitution and the statutes of the United States , and of the several State , and to declare the law , and , when their judgments are rendered , to enforce them by such remedies as legislation has prescribed , or as are allowed by the established practice . When they go beyond this , they go outside of their legitimate domain , and encroach upon the other departments of the government ; and all will admit that a strict confinement of each department within its own proper sphere was designed by the founders of our government , and is essential to its successful administration .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This doctrine is not new in this court . It has been repeatedly asserted , after the most mature consideration . It was asserted in Ress v. City of Watertown . There the plaintiff , being the owner of certain bonds issued by the city of Watertown , in Wisconsin , to a railroad company , brought suit upon them in the Circuit Court of the United States , and recovered two judgments amounting to about $ 10,000 . Upon these judgments he issued executions , which were returned unsatisfied . He then applied to the Circuit Court , and obtained a writ of mandamus upon the authorities of Watertown to levy and collect a tax upon the taxable property of the city to pay the judgments ; but before the writs could be served a majority of the members of the council resigned their offices . Subsequent writs of mandamus obtained by him proved ineffectual , by reason of similar resignations . He then filed a bill alleging that the corporate authorities were trustees for the benefit of the creditors of the city ; that the property of the citizens was a trust fund for the payment of its debts , and that it was the duty of the court to lay hold of such property and cause it to be applied ; and he prayed that the court would subject the taxable property of the city to the payment of the judgments . To this bill the city made answer ; and on the argument of the case , among other points , the question arose whether it was competent for the court , on the failure of the officers of the city to levy the tax as required by law , to appoint the marshal of the court to levy and collect the tax to pay the judgments . Upon this question , the judges being divided , the point was certified to this court . In disposing of it we said : ' We are of the opinion that this court has not the power to direct a tax to be levied for the payment of these judgments . This power to impose burdens and raise money is the highest attribute of sovereignty , and is exercised , first , to raise money for public purposes only ; and , second , by the power of legislative authority only . It is a power that has not been extended to the judiciary . Especially is it beyond the power of the Federal judiciary to assume the place of a State in the exercise of this authority at once so delicate and so important .

In the case of Heine v. The Levee Commissioners of New Orleans , the question again arose whether it was competent for the Circuit Court of the United States to direct its officers to levy and collect a tax to pay the claims of the plaintiffs , who were holders of bonds issued by the commissioners ; and the answer was equally emphatic both in the Circuit Court and in this court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In the Circuit Court , over which Mr. Justice Bradley then presided , the possession of the power of taxation had been denied . ' The judicial department , ' said the Justice , ' has no power over the subject . If the officers who are charged with the duty of laying or collecting taxes refuse to perform their functions , the court , in a clear case of failure , and at the instance of a party directly interested , can , by the prerogative writ of mandamus , compel them to perform acts which are ministerial , as distinguished from those which are judicial or discretionary . This is all that the judicial department can do on the subject , unless the legislature has expressly conferred upon it further powers . ' 1 Woods , 247 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
And when the case came before this court , we here said , Mr. Justice Miller delivering the opinion : ' The power we are here asked to exercise is the very delicate one of taxation . This power belongs , in this country , to the legislative sovereignty , State or National . In the case before us the national sovereignty has nothing to do with it . The power must be derived from the legislature of the State . So far as the present case is concerned , the State has delegated the power to the levee commissioners . If that body has ceased to exist , the remedy is in the legislature , either to assess the tax by special statute , or to vest the power in some other tribunal . It certainly is not vested , as in the exercise of an original jurisdiction , in any Federal court . It is unreasonable to suppose that the legislature would ever select a Federal court for that purpose . It is not only not one of the inherent powers of the court to levy and collect taxes , but it is an invasion by the judiciary of the Federal government of the legislative functions of the State government . It is a most extraordinary request , and a compliance with it would involve consequences no less out of the way of judicial procedure , the end of which no wisdom can foresee . ' 19 Wall . 655 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
These authoritiesand many others to the same purport might be citedare sufficient to support what we have said , that the power to levy taxes is one which belongs exclusively to the legislative department , and from that it necessarily follows that the regulation and control of all the agencies by which taxes are collected must belong to it .	@@empty@@	unmatched
When creditors are unable to obtain payment of their judgments against municipal bodies by execution , they can proceed by mandamus against the municipal authorities to compel them to levy the necessary tax for that purpose , if such authorities are clothed by the legislature with the taxing power , and such tax , when collected , can not be diverted to other uses ; but if those authorities possess no such power , or their offices have been abolished and the power withdrawn , the remedy of the creditors is by an appeal to the legislature , which alone can give them relief . No Federal court , either on its law or equity side , has any inherent jurisdiction to lay a tax for any purpose , or to enforce a tax already levied , except through the agencies provided by law . However urgent the appeal of creditors and the apparent hopelessness of their position without the aid of the Federal court , it can not seize the power which belongs to the legislative department of the State and wield it in their behalf .	@@empty@@	unmatched
To return to the question propounded : what is the property of a municipal corporation which , on its dissolution , the courts can reach and apply to the payment of its debts ?	@@empty@@	unmatched
We answer , it is the private property of the corporation , that is , such as it held in its own right for profit or as a source of revenue , not charged with any public trust or use , and funds in its possession unappropriated to any specific purpose . In this respect the position of the extinct corporation is not dissimilar to that of a deceased individual ; it is only such property as is possessed , freed from any trust , general or special , which can go in liquidation of debts .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The decree of the Circuit Court proceeding upon a different theory of its control over the uncollected taxes of the repealed corporation , and of the property which could be applied to the payment of its debts , can not be maintained .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On another ground , also , the decree is equally untenable . It adjudges that ' all the property within the limits of the territory of the city of Memphis is liable , and may be subjected to the payment of all the debts ' for which the suits are brought , and that ' such liability shall be enforced thereafter , from time to time , in such manner ' as the court may direct .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In so State of the Union , outside of New England , does the doctrine obtain that the private property of individuals within the limits of a municipal corporation can be reached by its creditors , and subjected to the payment of their demands . In Massachusetts and Connecticut , and perhaps in other States in New England , the individual liability of the inhabitants of towns , parishes , and cities , for the debts of the latter , is maintained , and executions upon judgments issued against them can be enforced against the private property of the inhabitants . But this doctrine is admitted by the courts of those States to be peculiar to their jurisprudence , and an exception to the rule elsewhere prevailing . Elsewhere the private property of the inhabitants of a municipal body can not be subjected to the payment of its debts , except by way of taxation ; but taxes , as we have already said , can only be levied by legislative authority . The power of taxation is not one of the functions of the judiciary ; and whatever authority the States may , under their constitutions , confer upon special tribunals of their own , the Federal courts can not by reason of it take any additional powers which are not judicial .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In Rees v. City of Watertown , from which we have already quoted , the power asserted by the decree was claimed by counsel , but was rejected by the court . ' Assume , ' said the court , ' that the plaintiff is entitled to the payment of his judgment , and that the defendant neglects its duty in refusing to raise the amount by taxation , it does not follow that this court may order the amount to be made from the private estate of one of its citizens . This summary proceeding would involve a violation of the rights of the latter . He has never been heard in court . He has had no opportunity to establish a defence to the debt itself , or , if the judgment is valid , to show that his property is not liable to its payment . It is well settled that legislaive exemptions from taxation are valid , that such exemptions may be perpetual in their duration , and that they are , in some cases , beyond legislative interference . The proceeding supposed would violate the fundamental principle contained in chapter twenty - ninth of Magna Charta , and embodied in the Constitution of the United States , that no man shall be deprived of his property without due process of law ; that is , he must be served with notice of the proceeding , and have a day in court to make his defence .

It is pressed upon us with great earnestness by counsel , that unless the Federal courts come to the aid of the creditors of Memphis , and enforce , through their own officers , the taxes levied before the repeal of its charter , they will be remediless . But the conclusion does not follow . The taxes levied pursuant to writs of mandamus issued by the Circuit Court are still to be collected , the agency only for their collection being changed . The receiver appointed by the governor has taken the place of the collecting officers of the city . The funds received by him upon the special taxes thus levied can not be appropriated to any other uses . The receiver , and any other agent of the State for the collection , can be compelled by the court , equally as the former collecting officers of the city , to proceed with the collection of such taxes by the sale of property or by suit , or in any other way authorized by law , and to apply the proceeds upon the judgments . If relief is not thus afforded to the creditors , they must appeal to the legislature . We can not presume that the appeal will be in vain . We can not say that on a proper representation they will not receive favorable action .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is certainly of the highest importance to the people of every State that it should make provision , not merely for the payment of its own indebtedness , but for the payment of the indebtedness of its different municipalities . Hesitation to do this is weakness ; refusal to do it is dishonor . Infidelity to engagements causes loss of character to the individual ; it entails reproach upon the State .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Federal judiciary has never failed , so far as it was in its power , to compel the performance of all lawful contracts , whether of the individual , or of the municipality , or of the State . It has unhesitatingly brushed aside all legislation of the State impairing their obligation . When a tax has been authorized by law to meet them , it has compelled the officers of assessment to proceed and levy the tax , and the officers of collection to proceed and collect it , and apply the proceeds . In some instances , where the tax was the inducement and consideration of the contract , all attempts at its repeal have been held invalid . But this has been the limit of its power . It can not make laws when the State refuses to pass them . It is itself but the servant of the law . If the State will not levy a tax , or provide for one , the Federal judiciary can not assume the legislative power of the State and proceed to levy the tax . If the State has provied incompetent officers of collection , the Federal judiciary can not remove them and put others more competent in their place . If the State appoints no officers of collection , the Federal judiciary can not assume to itself that duty . It can not take upon itself to supply the defects and omissions of State legislation . It would ill perform the duties assigned to it by assuming power properly belonging to the legislative department of the State .	@@empty@@	unmatched

The several bills of the complainants were consolidated in the Circuit Court , and , so far as it appears , without objection . They are , therefore , to be considered as one case . The important facts averred in the bills and confessed by the demurrer are the following:	@@empty@@	unmatched
The complainants are creditors of the city of Memphis . For a part of their claims they had recovered judgments against the city before the bills were filed , and had obtained writs of mandamus to enforce the levy of taxes to satisfy the judgments . In obedience to these writs the proper city authorities had levied the taxes required , but had neglected to collect them , in large measure , and , even when a portion of the taxes had been collected , had failed to appropriate the money collected to the payment of the judgments for which it had been specially levied , and to which alone it could be lawfully applied . Some of the money thus collected remained on deposit . These levies were made during the years 1875 , 1876 , 1877 , and 1878 , the city ordinances by which they were ordered specifying the amounts and the parties for whom the taxes were levied . The complainants were also large general creditors of the city , holding its obligations , upon which no judgments had been recovered .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Besides the special levies , made as above stated , the city authorities had made others for the purpose of paying interest on the city debt and for general uses . These taxes also remained uncollected . Meanwhile the city had nothing liable to execution at law , and no property except what it held for public uses ( in distinction from private ) , such as public municipal buildings , parks , streets , fire apparatus , & c. It was insolvent .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Such was the situation when these bills were filed . Their object was to obtain the appointment of a receiver to take possession of the assets of the city ( including the collected but not appropriated taxes , as well as the claims and bills for past - due and uncollected taxes ) , and to collect the same with a view to their being applied according to equity and legal right .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The principal one of the consolidated bills was filed on the twenty - eighth day of January , 1879 , by Garrett et al . Almost immediately after it was filed,the next day , indeed,an act of the legislature of the State was passed , approved Jan. 31 , 1879 , by which the charter of the city was repealed , all power of taxation in any form was withdrawn from its authorities , and all persons holding office under the repealed acts , which constituted the charter and endowed it with power , were prohibited from attempting to exercise any of the functions of their offices . The public buildings , squares , promenades , wharves , streets , alleys , parks , fire - engines , hose and carriages , engineer instruments , and all other property , real and personal , theretofore used for municipal purposes , were declared to be transferred to the control and custody of the State , to remain public property , as it always had been , for the uses to which it had theretofore been applied . The act contained no reservation of the rights of creditors , and said nothing of any outstanding taxes which had been levied but not collected , and it was declared to take effect from and after its passage .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On the same day , Jan. 29 , 1879 , another act of the legislature was passed , approved Jan. 31 , 1879 , by which the identical territory that had been embraced in the territorial limits of the city of Memphis was erected into what the act calls a ' taxing district . ' The act declared that the necessary taxes for the support of the government thus established should be imposed directly by the General Assembly of the State and not otherwise . It established a board of fire and police commissioners , a committee on ordinances , or local laws , to be known as the legislative council , consisting of the commissioners of the fire and police boards and the supervisors of the board of public works . It established also a board of health , and a board of public works . It prohibited the commissioners from issuing any evidences of indebtedness , and declared that no property , real or personal , held by them for public use , should ever be subject to execution , or attachment , or seizure under any legal process for any debt created by said commissioners , and that all taxes due , or moneys in the hands of the county trustee , or on deposit , should be exempt from seizure under attachment , execution , garnishment , or other legal process . The act also declared that neither the commissioners , nor the trustee , nor the new government created by the act , should pay or be liable for any debt created by the extinct corporation ( i. e. the city of Memphis ) , and that none of the taxes collected under the act should ever be used for the payment of any of the said debts . The act was declared to take effect from its passage . Its fourteenth section , as subsequently amended , declared that all the property of the city mentioned as transferred to the State by the act first mentioned should be thereby transferred to the custody and control of the board of commissioners of the taxing district , and that all indebtedness for taxes , or otherwise , whether in litigation or not , due the municipality , namely , the city , should vest in and become the property of the State , to be disposed of as should thereafter be provided by law .	@@empty@@	unmatched
These two acts were passed , as has been noticed , on the 29th of January , 1879 , and approved two days thereafter .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On the 7th of February , 1879 , the complainants , Garrett et al . , filed , by leave of the court , an amended and supplemental bill , averring what had been charged in the original , and setting forth , inter alia , these acts of the legislature , denying their constitutionality , and praying , as in the original bill , for the appointment of a receiver , and praying also that the bill might be taken as a general creditors ' bill for all creditors who might come in within a limited time and prove their claims .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The other bills were filed severally on Jan. 30 , 1879 , Feb. 3 , 8 , and 10 , next following , and on the 12th of February the cases were consolidated , and T. J.

2 . Congress , justifiably concerned with evidence that deportable criminal aliens who are not detained continue to engage in crime and fail to appear for their removal hearings in large numbers , may require that persons such as respondent be detained for the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings . In the exercise of its broad power over naturalization and immigration , Congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens . Mathews v. Diaz , 426 U. S. 67 . Although the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process in deportation proceedings , Reno v. Flores , 507 U. S. 292 , detention during such proceedings is a constitutionally valid aspect of the process , e.g. , Wong Wing v. United States , 163 U. S. 228 , even where , as here , aliens challenge their detention on the grounds that there has been no finding that they are unlikely to appear for their deportation proceedings , Carlson v. Landon , 342 U. S. 524 . The INS detention of respondent , a criminal alien who has conceded that he is deportable , for the limited period of his removal proceedings , is governed by these cases . Respondent argues unpersuasively that the § 1226(c ) detention policy violates due process under Zadvydas , 533 U. S. , at 699 , in which the Court held that § 1231(a)(b ) authorizes continued detention of an alien subject to a final removal order beyond that sections 90-day removal period for only such time as is reasonably necessary to secure the removal . Zadvydas is materially different from the present case in two respects . First , the aliens there challenging their detention following final deportation orders were ones for whom removal was no longer practically attainable, such that their detention did not serve its purported immigration purpose . Id. , at 690 . In contrast , because the statutory provision at issue in this case governs detention of deportable criminal aliens pending their removal proceedings , the detention necessarily serves the purpose of preventing the aliens from fleeing prior to or during such proceedings . Second , while the period of detention at issue in Zadvydas was indefinite and potentially permanent, i d . , at 690691 , the record shows that 1226(c ) detention not only has a definite termination point , but lasts , in the majority of cases , for less than the 90 days the Court considered presumptively valid in Zadvydas . Pp . 620 .	No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia , when in actual service in time of war or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation .	54

Section 236(c ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act , 66Stat . 200 , as amended , 110Stat . 3009585 , 8 U. S. C. § 1226(c ) , provides that [t]he Attorney General shall take into custody any alien who is removable from this country because he has been convicted of one of a specified set of crimes . Respondent is a citizen of the Republic of South Korea . He entered the United States in 1984 , at the age of six , and became a lawful permanent resident of the United States two years later . In July 1996 , he was convicted of first - degree burglary in state court in California and , in April 1997 , he was convicted of a second crime , petty theft with priors. The Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) charged respondent with being deportable from the United States in light of these convictions , and detained him pending his removal hearing . 1 We hold that Congress , justifiably concerned that deportable criminal aliens who are not detained continue to engage in crime and fail to appear for their removal hearings in large num- bers , may require that persons such as respondent be detained for the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Respondent does not dispute the validity of his prior convictions , which were obtained following the full procedural protections our criminal justice system offers . Respondent also did not dispute the INS conclusion that he is subject to mandatory detention under § 1226(c ) . See Brief in Opposition 12 ; App . 89 . 2 In conceding that he was deportable , respondent forwent a hearing at which he would have been entitled to raise any nonfrivolous argument available to demonstrate that he was not properly included in a mandatory detention category .

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed . Kim v. Ziglar , 276 F. 3d 523 ( 2002 ) . That court held that § 1226(c ) violates substantive due process as applied to respondent because he is a permanent resident alien . Id. , at 528 . It noted that permanent resident aliens constitute the most favored category of aliens and that they have the right to reside permanently in the United States , to work here , and to apply for citizenship . Ibid . The court recognized and rejected the Governments two principal justifications for mandatory detention under § 1226(c ) : ( 1 ) ensuring the presence of criminal aliens at their removal proceedings ; and ( 2 ) protecting the public from dangerous criminal aliens . The Court of Appeals discounted the first justification because it found that not all aliens detained pursuant to § 1226(c ) would ultimately be deported . Id. , at 531532 . And it discounted the second justification on the grounds that the aggravated felony classification triggering respondents detention included crimes that the court did not consider egregious or otherwise sufficiently dangerous to the public to necessitate mandatory detention . Id. , at 532533 . Respondents crimes of first - degree burglary ( burglary of an inhabited dwelling ) and petty theft , for instance , the Ninth Circuit dismissed as rather ordinary crimes. Id. , at 538 . Relying upon our recent decision in Zadvydas v. Davis , 533 U. S. 678 ( 2001 ) , the Court of Appeals concluded that the INS had not provided a justification for no - bail civil detention sufficient to overcome a lawful permanent resident aliens liberty interest. 276 F. 3d , at 535 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In his habeas corpus challenge , respondent did not contest Congress general authority to remove criminal aliens from the United States . Nor did he argue that he himself was not deportable within the meaning of § 1226(c ) . 6 Rather , respondent argued that the Government may not , consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment , detain him for the brief period necessary for his removal proceedings . The dissent , after an initial detour on the issue of respondents concession , see post , at 24 ( opinion of Souter , J. ) , ultimately acknowledges the real issue in this case . Post , at 17 , n. 11 ; see also Brief in Opposition 12 ( explaining that respondents challenge is solely to Section 1226(c)s absolute prohibition on his release from detention ) .

It is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings. Flores , supra , at 306 . At the same time , however , this Court has recognized detention during deportation proceedings as a constitutionally valid aspect of the deportation process . As we said more than a century ago , deportation proceedings would be vain if those accused could not be held in custody pending the inquiry into their true character. Wong Wing v. United States , 163 U. S. 228 , 235 ( 1896 ) ; see also Flores , supra , at 305306 ; Zadvydas , 533 U.

In Carlson v. Landon , 342 U. S. 524 ( 1952 ) , the Court considered a challenge to the detention of aliens who were deportable because of their participation in Communist activities . The detained aliens did not deny that they were members of the Communist Party or that they were therefore deportable . I d . , at 530 . Instead , like respondent in the present case , they challenged their detention on the grounds that there had been no finding that they were unlikely to appear for their deportation proceedings when ordered to do so . I d . , at 531532 ; see also Brief for Petitioner in Carlson v. Landon , O. T. 1951 , No . 35 , p. 12 ( arguing that legislative determinations could not justify depriving [ an alien ] of his liberty without facts personal to the individual ) . Although the Attorney General ostensibly had discretion to release detained Communist aliens on bond , the INS had adopted a policy of refusing to grant bail to those aliens in light of what Justice Frankfurter viewed as the mistaken conception that Congress had made [ alien Communists ] in effect unbailable. 342 U. S. , at 559 , 568 ( dissenting opinion ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court rejected the aliens claims that they were entitled to be released from detention if they did not pose a flight risk , explaining [d]etention is necessarily a part of this deportation procedure. Id. , at 538 ; see also i d . , at 535 . The Court noted that Congress had chosen to make such aliens deportable based on its understanding of [ Communists ] attitude toward the use of force and violence … to accomplish their political aims. I d . , at 541 . And it concluded that the INS could deny bail to the detainees by reference to the legislative scheme even without any finding of flight risk . I d . , at 543 ; see also i d . , at 550 ( Black , J. , dissenting ) ( Denial [ of bail ] was not on the ground that if released [ the aliens ] might try to evade obedience to possible deportation orders ) ; i d . , at 551 , and n. 6 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The dissent argues that , even though the aliens in Carlson were not flight risks , individualized findings of dangerousness were made as to each of the aliens . Post , at 35 ( opinion of Souter , J. ) . The dissent , again , is mistaken . The aliens in Carlson had not been found individually dangerous . The only evidence against them was their membership in the Communist Party and a degree … of participation in Communist activities. 342 U. S. , at 541 . There was no individualized findin[g] of likely future dangerousness as to any of the aliens and , in at least one case , there was a specific finding of nondangerousness . 8 The Court nonetheless concluded that the denial of bail was permissible by reference to the legislative scheme to eradicate the evils of Communist activity. Id. , at 543 . 9	@@empty@@	unmatched
In Reno v. Flores , 507 U. S. 292 ( 1993 ) the Court considered another due process challenge to detention during deportation proceedings . The due process challenge there was brought by a class of alien juveniles . The INS had arrested them and was holding them in custody pending their deportation hearings . The aliens challenged the agencys policy of releasing detained alien juveniles only into the care of their parents , legal guardians , or certain other adult relatives . See , e.g. , i d . , at 297 ( citing Detention and Release of Juveniles , 53 Fed . Reg . 17449 ( 1988 ) ( codified as to deportation at 8 CFR § 242.24 ( 1992 ) ) ) . The aliens argued that the policy improperly relied upon a blanket presumption of the unsuitability of custodians other than parents , close relatives , and guardians to care for the detained juvenile aliens . 507 U. S. , at 313 . In rejecting this argument , the Court emphasized that reasonable presumptions and generic rules, even when made by the INS rather than Congress , are not necessarily impermissible exercises of Congress traditional power to legislate with respect to aliens . Ibid . ; see also i d . , at 313 314 ( In the case of each detained alien juvenile , the INS makes those determinations that are specific to the individual and necessary to accurate application of the regulation … . The particularization and individuation need go no further than this ) . Thus , as with the prior challenges to detention during deportation proceedings , the Court in Flores rejected the due process challenge and upheld the constitutionality of the detention .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Despite this Courts longstanding view that the Government may constitutionally detain deportable aliens during the limited period necessary for their removal proceedings , respondent argues that the narrow detention policy reflected in 28 U. S. C. § 1226(c ) violates due process . Respondent , like the four Courts of Appeals that have held § 1226(c ) to be unconstitutional , relies heavily upon our recent opinion in Zadvydas v. Davis , 533 U. S. 678 ( 2001 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In Zadvydas , the Court considered a due process challenge to detention of aliens under 8 U. S. C. § 1231 ( 1994 ed . , Supp . V ) , which governs detention following a final order of removal . Section 1231(a)(b ) provides , among other things , that when an alien who has been ordered removed is not in fact removed during the 90-day statutory removal period, that alien may be detained beyond the removal period in the discretion of the Attorney General . The Court in Zadvydas read § 1231 to authorize continued detention of an alien following the 90-day removal period for only such time as is reasonably necessary to secure the aliens removal . 533 U. S. , at 699 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
But Zadvydas is materially different from the present case in two respects .	@@empty@@	unmatched
First , in Zadvydas , the aliens challenging their detention following final orders of deportation were ones for whom removal was no longer practically attainable. Id. , at 690 . The Court thus held that the detention there did not serve its purported immigration purpose . Ibid . In so holding , the Court rejected the Governments claim that , by detaining the aliens involved , it could prevent them from fleeing prior to their removal . The Court observed that where , as there , detentions goal is no longer practically attainable , detention no longer bears a reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual was committed .  Ibid . ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted ) . 10	@@empty@@	unmatched
In the present case , the statutory provision at issue governs detention of deportable criminal aliens pending their removal proceedings . Such detention necessarily serves the purpose of preventing deportable criminal aliens from fleeing prior to or during their removal proceedings , thus increasing the chance that , if ordered removed , the aliens will be successfully removed . Respondent disagrees , arguing that there is no evidence that mandatory detention is necessary because the Government has never shown that individualized bond hearings would be ineffective . See Brief for Respondent 14 . But as discussed above , see supra , at 67 , in adopting § 1226(c ) , Congress had before it evidence suggesting that permitting discretionary release of aliens pending their removal hearings would lead to large numbers of deportable criminal aliens skipping their hearings and remaining at large in the United States unlawfully .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Respondent argues that these statistics are irrelevant and do not demonstrate that individualized bond hearings are ineffective or burdensome. Brief for Respondent 33 40 . It is of course true that when Congress enacted § 1226 , individualized bail determinations had not been tested under optimal conditions , or tested in all their possible permutations . But when the Government deals with deportable aliens , the Due Process Clause does not require it to employ the least burdensome means to accomplish its goal . The evidence Congress had before it certainly supports the approach it selected even if other , hypothetical studies might have suggested different courses of action . Cf . , e.g . , Los Angeles v. Alameda Books , Inc. , 535 U. S. 425 , 436437 ( 2002 ) ; Flores , 507 U. S. , at 315 ( It may well be that other policies would be even better , but we are [ not ] a legislature charged with formulating public policy  ( quoting Schall v. Martin , 467 U.

The “ shock the conscience ” standard typically is employed when determining whether governmental action violates due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments . See County of Sacramento v. Lewis , 523 U. S. 833 , 847 , n. 8 ( 1998 ) ( “ [ I]n a due process challenge to executive action , the threshold question is whether the behavior of the governmental officer is so egregious , so outrageous , that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience ” ) . This Court has said that the “ shock the conscience ” standard is satisfied where the conduct was “ intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest , ” or in some circumstances if it resulted from deliberate indifference . Id. , at 849–850 .	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each state , excluding Indians not taxed . But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof .

The Congress shall have power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article .	56
That standard is not reflected in Rule 52(b ) itself , nor in how this Court has applied the plain - error doctrine . The Court repeatedly has reversed judgments for plain error on the basis of inadvertent or unintentional errors of the court or the parties below . See , e.g. , Silber v. United States , 370 U. S. 717 , 717–718 ( 1962 ) ( per curiam ) ( reversing judgment for plain error as a result of insufficient indictment ) ; Brasfield v. United States , 272 U. S. 448 , 449–450 ( 1926 ) ( reversing judgment for plain error where the trial judge improperly inquired of a jury ’s numerical division ) ; Clyatt v. United States , 197 U. S. 207 , 222 ( 1905 ) ( reversing judgment for plain error where the Government presented insufficient evidence to sustain conviction ) . The Court also “ routinely remands ” cases involving inadvertent or unintentional errors , including sentencing errors , for consideration of Olano ’s fourth prong with the understanding that such errors may qualify for relief .

The Fifth Circuit ’s additional focus on errors that “ serve as a powerful indictment against our system of justice , or seriously call into question the competence or integrity of the district judge , ” 850 F. 3d , at 250 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) , similarly alters the Rule 52(b ) standard . The Court has never said that errors must amount to a “ powerful indictment ” of the system , a phrase which implies by its terms that the only errors worthy of correction are those that rise to the level of grossly serious misconduct . Similarly , the Fifth Circuit ’s emphasis on the “ competence or integrity of the district judge ” narrows Olano ’s instruction that an error should be corrected if it seriously affects “ judicial proceedings . ” In articulating such a high standard , the Fifth Circuit substantially changed Olano ’s fourth prong .	@@empty@@	unmatched

The effect of the Fifth Circuit ’s heightened standard is especially pronounced in a case like this one . A plain Guidelines error that affects a defendant ’s substantial rights is precisely the type of error that ordinarily warrants relief under Rule 52(b ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In Molina - Martinez , the Court recognized that “ [ w]hen a defendant is sentenced under an incorrect Guidelines range — whether or not the defendant ’s ultimate sentence falls within the correct range — the error itself can , and most often will , be sufficient to show a reasonable probability of a different outcome absent the error . ” 578 U. S. , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 9 ) . In other words , an error resulting in a higher range than the Guidelines provide usually establishes a reasonable probability that a defendant will serve a prison sentence that is more than “ necessary ” to fulfill the purposes of incarceration . 18 U. S. C. § 3553(a ) ; Tapia , 564 U. S. , at 325 . “ To a prisoner , ” this prospect of additional “ time behind bars is not some theoretical or mathematical concept . ” Barber v. Thomas , 560 U. S. 474 , 504 ( 2010 ) ( Kennedy , J. , dissenting ) . “ [ A]ny amount of actual jail time ” is significant , Glover v. United States , 531 U.

Jenkins , 854 F. 3d 181 , 192 ( CA2 2017 ) . The possibility of additional jail time thus warrants serious consideration in a determination whether to exercise discretion under Rule 52(b ) .

The question on which we granted certiorari , 541 U. S. 972 ( 2004 ) , is narrow : Whether the Fourth Amendment requires reasonable , articulable suspicion to justify using a drug - detection dog to sniff a vehicle during a legitimate traffic stop. Pet . for Cert . i. Thus , we proceed on the assumption that the officer conducting the dog sniff had no information about respondent except that he had been stopped for speeding ; accordingly , we have omitted any reference to facts about respondent that might have triggered a modicum of suspicion .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
Here , the initial seizure of respondent when he was stopped on the highway was based on probable cause , and was concededly lawful . It is nevertheless clear that a seizure that is lawful at its inception can violate the Fourth Amendment if its manner of execution unreasonably infringes interests protected by the Constitution . United States v. Jacobsen , 466 U. S. 109 , 124 ( 1984 ) . A seizure that is justified solely by the interest in issuing a warning ticket to the driver can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete that mission . In an earlier case involving a dog sniff that occurred during an unreasonably prolonged traffic stop , the Illinois Supreme Court held that use of the dog and the subsequent discovery of contraband were the product of an unconstitutional seizure . People v. Cox , 202 Ill. 2d 462 , 782 N. E. 2d 275 ( 2002 ) . We may assume that a similar result would be warranted in this case if the dog sniff had been conducted while respondent was being unlawfully detained .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
In the state - court proceedings , however , the judges carefully reviewed the details of Officer Gillettes conversations with respondent and the precise timing of his radio transmissions to the dispatcher to determine whether he had improperly extended the duration of the stop to enable the dog sniff to occur . We have not recounted those details because we accept the state courts conclusion that the duration of the stop in this case was entirely justified by the traffic offense and the ordinary inquiries incident to such a stop .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Despite this conclusion , the Illinois Supreme Court held that the initially lawful traffic stop became an unlawful seizure solely as a result of the canine sniff that occurred outside respondents stopped car . That is , the court characterized the dog sniff as the cause rather than the consequence of a constitutional violation . In its view , the use of the dog converted the citizen - police encounter from a lawful traffic stop into a drug investigation , and because the shift in purpose was not supported by any reasonable suspicion that respondent possessed narcotics , it was unlawful . In our view , conducting a dog sniff would not change the character of a traffic stop that is lawful at its inception and otherwise executed in a reasonable manner , unless the dog sniff itself infringed respondents constitutionally protected interest in privacy . Our cases hold that it did not .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Official conduct that does not compromise any legitimate interest in privacy is not a search subject to the Fourth Amendment . Jacobsen , 466 U. S. , at 123 . We have held that any interest in possessing contraband can not be deemed legitimate, and thus , governmental conduct that only reveals the possession of contraband compromises no legitimate privacy interest. Ibid . This is because the expectation that certain facts will not come to the attention of the authorities is not the same as an interest in privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable. Id. , at 122 ( punctuation omitted ) . In United States v. Place , 462 U. S. 696 ( 1983 ) , we treated a canine sniff by a well - trained narcotics - detection dog as " sui generis " because it " discloses only the presence or absence of narcotics , a contraband item . " Id. , at 707 ; see also Indianapolis v. Edmond , 531 U. S. 32 , 40 ( 2000 ) . Respondent likewise concedes that drug sniffs are designed , and if properly conducted are generally likely , to reveal only the presence of contraband. Brief for Respondent 17 . Although respondent argues that the error rates , particularly the existence of false positives , call into question the premise that drug - detection dogs alert only to contraband , the record contains no evidence or findings that support his argument . Moreover , respondent does not suggest that an erroneous alert , in and of itself , reveals any legitimate private information , and , in this case , the trial judge found that the dog sniff was sufficiently reliable to establish probable cause to conduct a full - blown search of the trunk .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
Accordingly , the use of a well - trained narcotics - detection dogone that " does not expose noncontraband items that otherwise would remain hidden from public view , " Place , 462 U. S. , at 707during a lawful traffic stop , generally does not implicate legitimate privacy interests . In this case , the dog sniff was performed on the exterior of respondents car while he was lawfully seized for a traffic violation . Any intrusion on respondents privacy expectations does not rise to the level of a constitutionally cognizable infringement .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This conclusion is entirely consistent with our recent decision that the use of a thermal - imaging device to detect the growth of marijuana in a home constituted an unlawful search . Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . Critical to that decision was the fact that the device was capable of detecting lawful activityin that case , intimate details in a home , such as at what hour each night the lady of the house takes her daily sauna and bath. I d . , at 38 . The legitimate expectation that information about perfectly lawful activity will remain private is categorically distinguishable from respondents hopes or expectations concerning the nondetection of contraband in the trunk of his car . A dog sniff conducted during a concededly lawful traffic stop that reveals no information other than the location of a substance that no individual has any right to possess does not violate the Fourth Amendment .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23

Illinois State Trooper Daniel Gillette stopped respondent for speeding on an interstate highway . When Gillette radioed the police dispatcher to report the stop , a second trooper , Craig Graham , a member of the Illinois State Police Drug Interdiction Team , overheard the transmission and immediately headed for the scene with his narcotics - detection dog . When they arrived , respondents car was on the shoulder of the road and respondent was in Gillettes vehicle . While Gillette was in the process of writing a warning ticket , Graham walked his dog around respondents car . The dog alerted at the trunk . Based on that alert , the officers searched the trunk , found marijuana , and arrested respondent . The entire incident lasted less than 10 minutes .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Respondent was convicted of a narcotics offense and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment and a $ 256,136 fine . The trial judge denied his motion to suppress the seized evidence and to quash his arrest . He held that the officers had not unnecessarily prolonged the stop and that the dog alert was sufficiently reliable to provide probable cause to conduct the search . Although the Appellate Court affirmed , the Illinois Supreme Court reversed , concluding that because the canine sniff was performed without any  specific and articulable facts  to suggest drug activity , the use of the dog unjustifiably enlarg[ed ] the scope of a routine traffic stop into a drug investigation. 207 Ill. 2d 504 , 510 , 802 N. E. 2d 202 , 205 ( 2003 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched

In United States v. Place , 462 U. S. 696 ( 1983 ) , we categorized the sniff of the narcotics - seeking dog as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment and held it was not a search . Id. , at 707 . The classification rests not only upon the limited nature of the intrusion , but on a further premise that experience has shown to be untenable , the assumption that trained sniffing dogs do not err . What we have learned about the fallibility of dogs in the years since Place was decided would itself be reason to call for reconsidering Place s decision against treating the intentional use of a trained dog as a search . The portent of this very case , however , adds insistence to the call , for an uncritical adherence to Place would render the Fourth Amendment indifferent to suspicionless and indiscriminate sweeps of cars in parking garages and pedestrians on sidewalks ; if a sniff is not preceded by a seizure subject to Fourth Amendment notice , it escapes Fourth Amendment review entirely unless it is treated as a search . We should not wait for these developments to occur before rethinking Place s analysis , which invites such untoward consequences . 1	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
At the heart both of Place and the Courts opinion today is the proposition that sniffs by a trained dog are sui generis because a reaction by the dog in going alert is a response to nothing but the presence of contraband . 2 See ibid . ( [T]he sniff discloses only the presence or absence of narcotics , a contraband item ) ; ante , at 34 ( assuming that a canine sniff by a well - trained narcotics dog will only reveal the presence or absence of narcotics , a contraband item  ( quoting Place , supra , at 707 ) ) . Hence , the argument goes , because the sniff can only reveal the presence of items devoid of any legal use , the sniff does not implicate legitimate privacy interests and is not to be treated as a search . Ante , at 4 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The infallible dog , however , is a creature of legal fiction . Although the Supreme Court of Illinois did not get into the sniffing averages of drug dogs , their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing well - trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy , whether owing to errors by their handlers , the limitations of the dogs themselves , or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine . See , e.g. , United States v. Kennedy , 131 F. 3d 1371 , 1378 ( CA10 1997 ) ( describing a dog that had a 71 % accuracy rate ) ; United States v. Scarborough , 128 F. 3d 1373 , 1378 , n. 3 ( CA10 1997 ) ( describing a dog that erroneously alerted 4 times out of 19 while working for the postal service and 8 % of the time over its entire career ) ; United States v.

Indeed , a study cited by Illinois in this case for the proposition that dog sniffs are generally reliable shows that dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from 12.5 to 60 % of the time , depending on the length of the search . See Reply Brief for Petitioner 13 ; K. Garner et al . , Duty Cycle of the Detector Dog : A Baseline Study 12 ( Apr. 2001 ) ( prepared under Federal Aviation Administration grant by the Institute for Biological Detection Systems of Auburn University ) . In practical terms , the evidence is clear that the dog that alerts hundreds of times will be wrong dozens of times .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Once the dogs fallibility is recognized , however , that ends the justification claimed in Place for treating the sniff as sui generis under the Fourth Amendment : the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband , and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime . This is not , of course , to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion , or probable cause , to search the container or enclosure ; the Fourth Amendment does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband . The point is simply that the sniff and alert can not claim the certainty that Place assumed , both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as sui generis and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny . And when that aura of uniqueness disappears , there is no basis in Place s reasoning , and no good reason otherwise , to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform . They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive , even when conventionally enhanced . The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations , but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort , which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched . Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures , to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area . And given the fallibility of the dog , the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband , just as a thermal - imaging device might do , as described in Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) . 3	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
It makes sense , then , to treat a sniff as the search that it amounts to in practice , and to rely on the body of our Fourth Amendment cases , including Kyllo , in deciding whether such a search is reasonable . As a general proposition , using a dog to sniff for drugs is subject to the rule that the object of enforcing criminal laws does not , without more , justify suspicionless Fourth Amendment intrusions . See Indianapolis v. Edmond , 531 U. S. 32 , 4142 ( 2000 ) . Since the police claim to have had no particular suspicion that Caballes was violating any drug law , 4 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it . It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence , which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest . See Brief for Respondent 31 . There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest , however , see Knowles v. Iowa , 525 U. S. 113 ( 1998 ) , for the police did nothing more than detain Caballes long enough to check his record and write a ticket . As a consequence , the reasonableness of the search must be assessed in relation to the actual delay the police chose to impose , and as Justice Ginsburg points out in her opinion , post , at 34 , the Fourth Amendment consequences of stopping for a traffic citation are settled law .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
In Berkemer v. McCarty , 468 U. S. 420 , 439440 ( 1984 ) , followed in Knowles , supra , at 488 , we held that the analogue of the common traffic stop was the limited detention for investigation authorized by Terry v. Ohio , 392 U. S. 1 ( 1968 ) . While Terry authorized a restricted incidental search for weapons when reasonable suspicion warrants such a safety measure , i d . , at 2526 , the Court took care to keep a Terry stop from automatically becoming a foot in the door for all investigatory purposes ; the permissible intrusion was bounded by the justification for the detention , i d . , at 2930 . 5 Although facts disclosed by enquiry within this limit might give grounds to go further , the government could not otherwise take advantage of a suspects immobility to search for evidence unrelated to the reason for the detention . That has to be the rule unless Terry is going to become an open - sesame for general searches , and that rule requires holding that the police do not have reasonable grounds to conduct sniff searches for drugs simply because they have stopped someone to receive a ticket for a highway offense . Since the police had no indication of illegal activity beyond the speed of the car in this case , the sniff search should be held unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and its fruits should be suppressed .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
Nothing in the case relied upon by the Court , United States v. Jacobsen , 466 U. S. 109 ( 1984 ) , unsettled the limit of reasonable enquiry adopted in Terry . In Jacobsen , the Court found that no Fourth Amendment search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained . The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine , the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake . 466 U. S. , at 123 . As already explained , however , the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate Fourth Amendment protection .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
In Jacobsen , once the powder was analyzed , that was effectively the end of the matter : either the powder was cocaine , a fact the owner had no legitimate interest in concealing , or it was not cocaine , in which case the test revealed nothing about the powder or anything else that was not already legitimately obvious to the police . But in the case of the dog sniff , the dog does not smell the disclosed contraband ; it smells a closed container . An affirmative reaction therefore does not identify a substance the police already legitimately possess , but informs the police instead merely of a reasonable chance of finding contraband they have yet to put their hands on . The police will then open the container and discover whatever lies within , be it marijuana or the owners private papers . Thus , while Jacobsen could rely on the assumption that the enquiry in question would either show with certainty that a known substance was contraband or would reveal nothing more , both the certainty and the limit on disclosure that may follow are missing when the dog sniffs the car . 6	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court today does not go so far as to say explicitly that sniff searches by dogs trained to sense contraband always get a free pass under the Fourth Amendment , since it reserves judgment on the constitutional significance of sniffs assumed to be more intrusive than a dogs walk around a stopped car , ante , at 4 . For this reason , I do not take the Courts reliance on Jacobsen as actually signaling recognition of a broad authority to conduct suspicionless sniffs for drugs in any parked car , about which Justice Ginsburg is rightly concerned , post , at 56 , or on the person of any pedestrian minding his own business on a sidewalk . But the Courts stated reasoning provides no apparent stopping point short of such excesses . For the sake of providing a workable framework to analyze cases on facts like these , which are certain to come along , I would treat the dog sniff as the familiar search it is in fact , subject to scrutiny under the Fourth Amendment . 7	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23

Appellee Elsie Mary Jane Leger is a lawfully admitted resident alien . She was born in Scotland in 1937 . She came to this country in 1965 at the age of 28 under contract for domestic service with a family in Havertown .

Under traditional equal protection principles , a State retains broad discretion to classify as long as its classification has a reasonable basis . Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co. , 220 U.S. 61 , 78 ( 1911 ) ; Williamson v. Lee Optical Co. , 348 U.S. 483 , 489 ( 1955 ) ; Morey v. Doud , 354 U.S. 457 , 465 ( 1957 ) ; McGowan v. Maryland , 366 U.S. 420 , 425 - 427 ( 1961 ) . This is so in " the area of economics and social welfare . " Dandridge v. Williams , 397 U.S. 471 , 485 ( 1970 ) . But the Court 's decisions [ p372 ] have established that classifications based on alienage , like those based on nationality [ n5 ] or race , [ n6 ] are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny . Aliens as a class are a prime example of a " discrete and insular " minority ( see United States v.

Arizona and Pennsylvania seek to justify their restrictions on the eligibility of aliens for public assistance solely on the basis of a State 's " special public interest " in favoring its own citizens over aliens in the distribution of limited resources such as welfare benefits .

It was said :	@@empty@@	unmatched

Whatever may be the contemporary vitality of the special public interest doctrine in other contexts after Takahashi , we conclude that a State 's desire to preserve limited welfare benefits for its own citizens is inadequate to justify Pennsylvania 's making noncitizens ineligible for public assistance , and Arizona 's restricting benefits to citizens and longtime resident aliens . First , the special public interest doctrine was heavily grounded on the notion that " [ w]hatever is a privilege , rather than a right , may be made dependent upon citizenship . " People v. Crane , 214 N.Y. at 164 , 108 N.E. at 430 . But this Court now has rejected the concept that constitutional rights turn upon whether a governmental benefit is characterized as a " right " or as a " privilege . " Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S. 398 , 404 ( 1963 ) ; Shapiro v. Thompson , 394 U.S. at 627 n. 6 ; Goldberg v. Kelly , 397 U.S. 254 , 262 ( 1970 ) ; Bell v. Burson , 402 U.S. 535 , 539 ( 1971 ) . Second , as the Court recognized in Shapiro :	@@empty@@	unmatched
394 U.S. at 633 . Since an alien , as well as a citizen , is a " person " for equal protection purposes , a concern for fiscal integrity is no more compelling a justification for the questioned classification in these cases than it was in Shapiro .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Appellants , however , would narrow the application of Shapiro to citizens by arguing that the right to travel , relied upon in that decision , extends only to citizens and not to aliens . While many of the Court 's opinions do speak in terms of the right of " citizens " to travel , [ n10 ] the source of the constitutional right to travel has never been ascribed to any particular constitutional provision . See Shapiro v. Thompson , 394 U.S. at 630 n. 8 ; United States v. Guest , 383 U.S. 745 , 757 - 758 ( 1966 ) . The Court has never decided whether the right applies specifically to aliens , and it is unnecessary to reach that question here . It is enough to say that the classification involved in Shapiro was subjected to strict scrutiny under the compelling state interest test , not because it was based on any suspect criterion such as race , nationality , or alienage , but because it impinged upon the fundamental right of interstate movement . As was said there ,	@@empty@@	unmatched

Williams , 397 U.S. 471 ( 1970 ) , is also misplaced , since the classification involved in that case ( family size ) neither impinged upon a fundamental constitutional right nor employed an inherently suspect criterion .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Pursuant to that power , Congress has provided , as part of a comprehensive plan for the regulation of immigration and naturalization , that " [ a]liens who are paupers , professional beggars , or vagrants , " or aliens who " are likely at any time to become public charges , " shall be excluded from admission into the United States , 8 U.S.C. § § 1182(a)(8 ) and 1182(a)(15 ) , and that any alien lawfully admitted shall be deported who " has within five years after entry become a public charge from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen after entry . . . .

Congress has broadly declared as federal policy that lawfully admitted resident aliens who become public charges for causes arising after their entry are not subject to deportation , and that , as long as they are here , they are entitled to the full and equal benefit of all state laws for the security of persons and property . The state statutes [ p379 ] at issue in the instant cases impose auxiliary burdens upon the entrance or residence of aliens who suffer the distress , after entry , of economic dependency or public assistance . Alien residency requirements for welfare benefits necessarily operate , as did the residency requirements in Shapiro , to discourage entry into or continued residency in the State .

[ n12 ] The provision appears to have its roots in identical language of the old - age assistance and aid - to - the - blind sections of the Social Security Act of 1935 as originally enacted . 49 Stat . 620 , 42 U.S.C. § 302(b ) ; 49 Stat . 645 , 42 U.S.C. § 1202(b ) . The House and Senate Committee Reports expressly state , with reference to old - age assistance , that :	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is apparent from this that Congress ' principal concern in 1935 was to prevent the States from distinguishing between native - born American citizens and naturalized citizens in the distribution of welfare benefits . It may be assumed that Congress was motivated by a similar concern in 1950 when it enacted § 1402(b ) . As for the indication in the 1935 Committee Reports that the States , in their discretion , could withhold benefits from noncitizens , certain members of Congress simply may have been expressing their understanding of the law only insofar as it had then developed , that is , before Takahashi was decided . But if § 1402(b ) , as well as the identical provisions for old - age assistance and aid to the blind , were to be read so as to authorize discriminatory treatment of aliens at the option of the States , Takahashi demonstrates that serious constitutional questions are presented . Although the Federal Government admittedly has broad constitutional power to determine what aliens shall be admitted to the United States , the period they may remain , and the terms and conditions of their naturalization , Congress does not have the power to authorize the individual States to violate the Equal Protection Clause . Shapiro v. Thompson , 394 U.S. at 641 . Under Art . I , § 8 , cl . 4 , of the Constitution , Congress ' power is to " establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization . " A congressional enactment construed so as to permit state legislatures to adopt divergent laws on the subject of citizenship requirements for federally supported welfare programs would appear to contravene this explicit constitutional requirement of uniformity . [ n14 ] Since " statutes should be construed whenever possible so as to uphold [ p383 ] their constitutionality , " United States v. Vuitch , 402 U.S. 62 , 70 ( 1971 ) , we conclude that § 1402(b ) does not authorize the Arizona 15-year national residency requirement .	@@empty@@	unmatched

The Life Association of America was , on the 5th of November , 1879 , a corporation of the State of Missouri , for the purpose of doing a kife insurance business , with its chief office at St. Louis , in that State . By the laws of doing a life insurance business , of the insurance department of the State government might , under certain circumstances , institute proceedings in the courts of the State for the dissolution of such a corporation and the winding up of its affairs . Sect . 6043 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri is as follows:	@@empty@@	unmatched
' Upon the rendition of a final judgment dissolving a company , or declaring it insolvent , all the assets of such company shall vest in fee - simple and absolutely in the superintendent of the insurance department of this State , and his successor or successors in office , who shall hold and dispose of the same for the use and benefit of the creditors and policy - holders of such company , and such other persons as may be interested in such assets . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
On the 13th of October , 1879 , L. E. Alexander , a citizen of Missouri , and the receiver of the Columbia Life Insurance Company of Missouri , recovered a claim against the Life Association of America of $ 1,100,000 , and thereupon William S. Relfe , the superintendent of the insurance department of the State , commenced proceedings under the statute to dissolve the lastnamed corporation and wind up its affairs . In his petition he prayed that the company might be enjoined from doing any further business , and that an agent might be appointed to take charge of its property temporarily . Such an order was made in the cause , and D. M. Frost , a citizen of Missouri , appointed temporary agent and receiver . Frost at once qualified under this appointment .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On the 5th of November , 1879 , Rundle and wife , the appellees , policy - holders of the company , commenced suit in the Fifth District Court of the Parish of New Orleans , against the life association , Frost , the temporary agent and receiver , John R. Fell , the local agent of the company at New Orleans , and L. E. Alexander , receiver of the Columbia Life Insurance Company , the object of which was to have the assets of the company in Louisiana declared a trust fund and applied to the payment of the claims of Louisiana creditors and policy - holders in preference to others . In the bill the decree in favor of the receiver of the Columbia Life Insurance Company , and the proceedings by Relfe , the superintendent of the insurance department , with the appointment of Frost as temporary receiver , were set out in detail , and the whole object and purpose of the suit was to keep the Louisiana assets out of the hands of Relfe and his successors in office . No special relief was asked against the receiver of the Columbia Life Insurance Company . Upon the filing , of the bill , Walter B. Wilcox was appointed receiver . Service of process was made on Alexander only through Francis B. Lee , who was appointed curator ad hoc at the same time that Wilcox was appointed receiver . Fell was made a party only for the purpose of reaching property in his hands .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On the 10th of November the company was dissolved by a decree of the Missouri court , and its property vested in Relfe , superintendent of the insurance department , as provided by the statute . On the 17th of the same month Relfe was , on his own motion , made a party to the suit in New Orleans , as the legal representative of the late corporation , and on the 28th he filed a petition for the removal of the cause to the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana . In his petition he set forth his own citizenship in Missouri , and that of the appellees in Louisiana . The citizenship of all the other persons named as parties to the suit appeared in the pleadings . He also gave the security required by the act of Congress , and on the 5th of December , which was in time , filed in the Circuit Court a copy of the record in the State court . On the 9th of the same month the receiver appointed in the State court moved to dismiss the cause and strike it from the docket of the Circuit Court : 1 , Because that court was without jurisdiction either of the person or the subject - matter ; 2 , because Relfe had no standing in court , he being a creature of the State of Missouri , without capacity to sue or remove causes in Louisiana ; 3 , because the suit was improperly removed ; and , 4 , because the State court having first taken charge of the property , the Circuit Court could not interfere with the possession of the receiver of that court . While this motion was pending , and on the 30th of December , the life association and Frost filed their petition in the State court , setting forth the former petition of Relfe , and adopting it and all that had been done under it as their own , and also asking that the suit be removed on their own account . They also gave the security required by the act of Congress . On the 5th of January the Circuit Court heard the motion of the State court receiver made on the 9th of December , and remanded the cause . From that order the life association , Relfe , and Frost took this appeal , under the fifth section of the act of 1875 , c. 137 . 18 Stat . , pt . 3 , p. 472 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We think the Circuit Court erred in remanding the cause . The entire controversy is between the appellees , representing the Louisiana creditors and policy - holders , on one side , and Relfe , the statutory representative of the corporation and its property , on the other , as to their respective rights to what the appellees claim are Louisiana assets belonging primarily to Louisiana creditors . Fell and the receiver of the Columbia Life Insurance Company are formal parties only . Fell has in his possession , as a naked trustee , some of the Louisiana assets , and the receiver of the Columbia Life Insurance Company is , so far as anything appears , no more than a general creditor of the dissolved corporation whom , necessarily , under the law , Relfe represents . After the decree of dissolution the Life Association Company had no longer any corporate existence , and the temporary agency and receivership of Frost was ended when the property of the corporation was transferred to Relfe and he became under the law entitled to the possession .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Relfe is not an officer of the Missouri State court , but the person designated by law to take the property of any dissolved life insurance corporation of that State , and hold and dispose of it in trust for the use and benefit of creditors , and other parties interested . The law which clothed him with this trust was , in legal effect , part of the charter of the corporation . He was the statutory successor of the corporation for the purpose of winding up its affairs . As such he represents the corporation at all times and places in all matters connected with his trust . He is the trustee of an express trust , with all the rights which properly belong to such a position . He is an officer of the State , and as such represents the State in its sovereignty while performing its public duties connected with the winding up of the affairs of one of its insolvent and dissolved corporations . His authority does not come from the decree of the court , but from the statute . He appeared in Louisiana not by virtue of any appointment from the court , but as the statutory successor of a corporation which the court had in a legitimate way dissolved and put out of existence . He was , in fact , the corporation itself for all the purposes of winding up its affairs .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We are aware that , except by virtue of some statutory authority , an administrator appointed in one State can not generally sue in another , and that a receiver appointed by a State court has no extra - territorial power ; but a corporation is the creature of legislation , and may be endowed with such powers as its creator sees fit to give . Necessarily it must act through agents , and the State which creates it may say who those agents shall be . One may be its representative when in active operation , and in full possession of all its powers , and another if it has forfeited its charter and has no lawful existence except to wind up its affairs . No State need allow the corporations of other States to do business within its jurisdiction unless it chooses , with perhaps the exception of commercial corporations ; but if it does , without limitation , express or implied , the corporation comes in as it has been created . Every corporation necessarily carries its charter wherever it goes , for that is the law of its existence . It may be restricted in the use of some of its powers while doing business away from its corporate home , but every person who deals with it everywhere is bound to take notice of the provisions which have been made in its charter for the management and control of its affairs both in life and after dissolution .	@@empty@@	unmatched
By the charter of this corporation , if a dissolution was decreed , its property passed by operation of law to the superintendent of the insurance department of the State , and he was charged with the duty of winding up its affairs . Every policyholder and creditor in Louisiana is charged with notice of this charter right which all interested in the affairs of the corporation can insist shall be regarded . The appellees , when they contracted with the Missouri corporation , impliedly agreed that if the corporation was dissolved under the Missouri laws , the superintendent of the insurance department of the State should represent the company in all suits instituted by them affecting the winding up of its affairs . Relfe , therefore , became , by operation of law , the successor of the corporation in the litigation these appellees instituted in Louisiana . He was , in legal effect , their only opponent in the suit they had begun , and as he appeared in time and was a citizen of Missouri , representing a Missouri corporation , he was entitled to remove the cause and require citizens of Louisiana to litigate their claims with him in the courts of the United States .	@@empty@@	unmatched

First , The said Joseph Smith , his heirs , executors , and administrators , agrees to superintend or cause to be superintended , and assist the soldiers in the erection of buildings at post of Beaver , Utah , according to plans and specifications ; and agrees , also , to supply or cause to be supplied all the skilled labor and material necessary for the erection of the buildings , in conformity with said plans and specifications .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Second , It is agreed that , for and in consideration of the faithful fulfilment of the above stipulations in all their parts , the party of the second part shall be paid by the United States , at the office of the A. A. Q. M. , at post of Beaver , Utah , as follows , viz:	@@empty@@	unmatched
Sixty - nine thousand one hundred and seventy - seven dollars ( $ 69,177 ) , provided that the United States is not liable for any amount beyond the sums appropriated for such purpose during the fiscal years in which the services are rendered . Payment to be made in instalments at completion of each separate building , or as soon thereafter as funds may be received for that purpose . The buildings to be inspected and accepted by the United States .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court of Claims found the following facts:	@@empty@@	unmatched
I. On the 1st December , 1873 , while the buildings were in progress of construction , the contractor was stopped by order of the post - commander , with the approval of the commander of the department , and all work under the contract was ordered to be suspended . The contractor objected to the work being stopped , and requested that he be released from his agreement , unless the work could go on . The matter was referred to the Quartermaster - General , and by him submitted to the Secretary of War . Pursuant to orders of the latter , the contractor was allowed to resume work . The period of suspension was from the 1st December , 1873 , to the 3d February , 1874 . The defendants have paid for the work done under the contract , but have not paid the damages occasioned by the suspension of the work .	@@empty@@	unmatched
II . On the 30th October , 1874 , General Ord , commanding the Department of the Platte , referred the contractor 's claim for damages caused by the suspension to the quartermaster of the post of Beaver , who had had entire charge of the work from the beginning to the completion thereof , with instructions to report as to the damages caused by ' the unexpected stoppages and delays inflicted on the contractor , Smith , by the orders from Washington and department head - quarters ; the exposed and unfinished condition in which he was compelled to leave the buildings during winter storms ; the remoteness of the place of building , where all skilled labor had to be provided from a great distance , and which was left sometimes unoccupied and unpaid for on the contractor 's hands ; the deterioration in value of material left exposed while waiting for orders to continue the work . ' The post quartermaster , under these instructions , reported the contractor 's losses at $ 8,000 , and the department commander approved the recommendation . The court finds the claimant 's damages for the same to be $ 5,000 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
III . During the progress of the work the contractor furnished and performed certain additional or extra work not required by his contract . But , on the inspection of the buildings before the final payment , it was found by the inspecting officer that the contractor had omitted to furnish and perform certain work required by the contract . It was subsequently agreed between the contractor and the defendant 's officers that the extra work furnished should be received and stand in the place of that omitted by the contractor , and under and in pursuance of such agreement or compromise the contractor was paid the balance remaining due of the contract price .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Upon the foregoing findings the court decided as conclusions of law,	@@empty@@	unmatched
1 . The officers of the government charged with the care and supervision of the building to be erected by the claimant had no right to hinder or delay him in the proper performance of his work : and for the suspension thereof , ordered by such officers in the supposed interest of the government , the claimant should recover such damages as were the necessary consequence of the suspension ; that is to say , such damages as would place him as nearly as possible in the same condition as he would have been in if he had been allowed to proceed without such interference , excluding therefrom , nevertheless , any loss or injury to his materials , which might have been prevented by the exercise of reasonable care and prudence on his part , in the storing , custody , and preservation thereof .	@@empty@@	unmatched
2 . The estimate or allowance of damages for the suspension of the work made by the post quartermaster , under the instructions of the commanding officer of the department , does not determine the amount thereof , and should be excluded by the court in making a computation of damages .	@@empty@@	unmatched
3 . The extra work on the buildings done by the claimant in addition to that required by the terms of his contract , and the deficiencies under the contract , as determined by the inspecting officer who inspected the work before acceptance by the government , as provided by the contract , were proper subjects of compromise and set - off , and , having been so compromised and set off against each other before final payment , the claimant is concluded from seeking a recovery for the former .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Mr. James Lowndes , contra .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The only questions presented in this case relate to the liability of the United States for damages growing out of the suspension of the work under the contract sued upon . In effect , the contract bound Smith to furnish the materials and erect the buildings , the labor being performed by the soldiers at the fort , except to the extent that skilled workmen were necessary . There was no time specified within which the work must be done , neither was there any power reserved by the United States to direct its suspension . Under such circumstances , the law implies that the work should be done within a reasonable time , and that the United States would not unnecessarily interfere to prevent this .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In Clark 's Case , 6 Wall . 546 , it was decided that the United States were liable for damages resulting from an improper interference with the work of a contractor ; and in Smoot 's Case , 15 i d . 47 , that the principles which govern inquiries as to the conduct of individuals , in respect to their contracts , are equally applicable where the United States are a party . The same rules were applied in the case of the Amoskeag Company , 17 i d . 592 . Here the work was stopped by order of the United States . Smith asked to be released from his contract , unless he could go on . This was refused until the expiration of sixty days , when he was allowed to resume . As between individuals , certainly , this would be considered an improper interference , and damages would be awarded to the extent of the loss which was the necessary consequence of the suspension . The United States must answer according to the same rule . In this respect , we can not consider this case different in principle from that of Clark , supra .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court of Claims has found the amount of the damages to have been $ 5,000 ; that is to say , that sum , in its opinion , from the evidence before it , was necessary to place Smith in the same condition he would have been in if he had been allowed to proceed without interference , and not allowing any thing for loss or injury to his materials , which he might have prevented by the exercise of reasonable care and prudence .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This rule of damages , as an abstract proposition , is clearly right . Unless , therefore , there appears in the record some error growing out of the estimation of the amount , the judgment below should be affirmed .	@@empty@@	unmatched
By our rules in reference to appeals from the Court of Claims , rule 1 , sect . 2 , that court sends here its finding of facts as ' established by the evidence , in the nature of a special verdict . ' The evidence is not sent up . This finding is conclusive , unless impeached for some error in law appearing in the record . Here , in effect , the error complained of is , that the court refused to state the items of its account of damages . This we have not required ; and while , under the practice we have established , liberal provision should be made for the review of questions of law , it seems to us that in this case the claim of the United States goes beyond any thing we ought to grant . The court might with propriety have been asked to state in a finding whether a particular item of claim or of damage was included in its estimate , and , if so , what amount . To such a finding exception might in proper form be taken , and then we could be called upon to decide whether such an item was legally the subject of compensation in an action for damages . The United States can be required to make compensation to a contractor for damages which he has actually sustained by their default in the performance of their undertakings to him ; but this is the extent of their liability in the Court of Claims . More than compensation for damages actually sustained can never be awarded against the United States .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In this case the United States asked the court to find ( 1 ) the amount of damage done to the building on account of exposure to the winter storms in its unfinished condition ; ( 2 ) the amount resulting from the retention of the skilled labor , & c. ; and ( 3 ) the deterioration in the value of materials . All these were legitimate subjects of inquiry by the court in making up its final estimate ; but we know of no rule of law or practice which requires a court or jury to specify the elements of the calculation by which it arrives at its final result . In this case the court was not asked to say whether it included this or that supposed element of compensation in its judgment ; but the only effort seems to have been to ascertain the items of calculation so as to determine whether the proof supported them . The whole contest evidently was as to the sufficiency of the evidence , not as to the liability of the United States if the facts as claimed were established by the proof .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In the estimation of damages the Court of Claims occupies the position of a jury under like circumstances . Damages must be proved . The court is not permitted to guess any more than a jury , but , like a jury , it must make its estimates from the proofs submitted . The result of the best judgment of the triers is all that the parties have any right to expect .	@@empty@@	unmatched

The Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department received word from a confidential informant that a potentially armed and dangerous parolee - at - large had been seen at a certain residence . While other officers searched the main house , Deputies Conley and Pederson searched the back of the property where , unbeknownst to the deputies , respondents Mendez and Garcia were napping inside a shack where they lived . Without a search warrant and without announcing their presence , the deputies opened the door of the shack . Mendez rose from the bed , holding a BB gun that he used to kill pests . Deputy Conley yelled , “ Gun ! ” and the deputies immediately opened fire , shooting Mendez and Garcia multiple times . Officers did not find the parolee in the shack or elsewhere on the property .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Mendez and Garcia sued Deputies Conley and Pederson and the County under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 , pressing three Fourth Amendment claims : a warrantless entry claim , a knock - and - announce claim , and an excessive force claim . On the first two claims , the District Court awarded Mendez and Garcia nominal damages . On the excessive force claim , the court found that the deputies’ use of force was reasonable under Graham v. Connor , 490 U. S. 386 , but held them liable nonetheless under the Ninth Circuit ’s provocation rule , which makes an officer ’s otherwise reasonable use of force unreasonable if ( 1 ) the officer “ intentionally or recklessly provokes a violent confrontation ” and ( 2 ) “ the provocation is an independent Fourth Amendment violation , ” Billington v. Smith , 292 F. 3d 1177 , 1189 . On appeal , the Ninth Circuit held that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity on the knock - and - announce claim and that the warrantless entry violated clearly established law . It also affirmed the District Court ’s application of the provocation rule , and held , in the alternative , that basic notions of proximate cause would support liability even without the provocation rule .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23

If law enforcement officers make a “ seizure ” of a person using force that is judged to be reasonable based on a consideration of the circumstances relevant to that determination , may the officers nevertheless be held liable for injuries caused by the seizure on the ground that they committed a separate Fourth Amendment violation that contributed to their need to use force ? The Ninth Circuit has adopted a “ provocation rule ” that imposes liability in such a situation .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
We hold that the Fourth Amendment provides no basis for such a rule . A different Fourth Amendment violation can not transform a later , reasonable use of force into an unreasonable seizure .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23

In October 2010 , deputies from the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department were searching for a parolee - at - large named Ronnie O’Dell . A felony arrest warrant had been issued for O’Dell , who was believed to be armed and dangerous and had previously evaded capture . Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law , No . 2:11–cv–04771 ( CD Cal . ) , App . to Pet . for Cert . 56a , 64a . Deputies Christopher Conley and Jennifer Pederson were assigned to assist the task force searching for O’Dell . Id. , at 57a–58a . The task force received word from a confidential informant that O’Dell had been seen on a bicycle at a home in Lancaster , California , owned by Paula Hughes , and the officers then mapped out a plan for apprehending O’Dell . Id. , at 58a . Some officers would approach the front door of the Hughes residence , while Deputies Conley and Pederson would search the rear of the property and cover the back door of the residence . Id. , at 59a . During this briefing , it was announced that a man named Angel Mendez lived in the backyard of the Hughes home with a pregnant woman named Jennifer Garcia ( now Mrs. Jennifer Mendez ) . Ibid . Deputy Pederson heard this announcement , but at trial Deputy Conley testified that he did not remember it . Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
When the officers reached the Hughes residence around midday , three of them knocked on the front door while Deputies Conley and Pederson went to the back of the property . Id. , at 63a . At the front door , Hughes asked if the officers had a warrant . Ibid . A sergeant responded that they did not but were searching for O’Dell and had a warrant for his arrest . Ibid . One of the officers heard what he thought were sounds of someone running inside the house . Id. , at 64a . As the officers prepared to open the door by force , Hughes opened the door and informed them that O’Dell was not in the house . Ibid . She was placed under arrest , and the house was searched , but O’Dell was not found . Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Meanwhile , Deputies Conley and Pederson , with guns drawn , searched the rear of the residence , which was cluttered with debris and abandoned automobiles . Id. , at 60a , 65a . The property included three metal storage sheds and a one - room shack made of wood and plywood . Id. , at 60a . Mendez had built the shack , and he and Garcia had lived inside for about 10 months . Id. , at 61a . The shack had a single doorway covered by a blue blanket . Ibid . Amid the debris on the ground , an electrical cord ran into the shack , and an air conditioner was mounted on the side . Id. , at 62a . A gym storage locker and clothes and other possessions were nearby . Id. , at 61a . Mendez kept a BB rifle in the shack for use on rats and other pests . Id. , at 62a . The BB gun “ closely resembled a small caliber rifle . ” Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Deputies Conley and Pederson first checked the three metal sheds and found no one inside . Id. , at 65a . They then approached the door of the shack . Id. , at 66a . Unbeknownst to the officers , Mendez and Garcia were in the shack and were napping on a futon . Id. , at 67a . The deputies did not have a search warrant and did not knock and announce their presence . Id. , at 66a . When Deputy Conley opened the wooden door and pulled back the blanket , Mendez thought it was Ms. Hughes and rose from the bed , picking up the BB gun so he could stand up and place it on the floor . Id. , at 68a . As a result , when the deputies entered , he was holding the BB gun , and it was “ point[ing ] somewhat south towards Deputy Conley . ” Id. , at 69a . Deputy Conley yelled , “ Gun ! ” and the deputies immediately opened fire , discharging a total of 15 rounds . Id. , at 69a–70a . Mendez and Garcia “ were shot multiple times and suffered severe injuries , ” and Mendez ’s right leg was later amputated below the knee . Id. , at 70a . O’Dell was not in the shack or anywhere on the property . Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Mendez and his wife ( respondents here ) filed suit under Rev. Stat . § 1976 , 42 U. S. C. § 1983 , against petitioners , the County of Los Angeles and Deputies Conley and Pederson . As relevant here , they pressed three Fourth Amendment claims . First , they claimed that the deputies executed an unreasonable search by entering the shack without a warrant ( the “ warrantless entry claim ” ) ; second , they asserted that the deputies performed an unreason - able search because they failed to announce their presence before entering the shack ( the “ knock - and - announce claim ” ) ; and third , they claimed that the deputies effected an unreasonable seizure by deploying excessive force in opening fire after entering the shack ( the “ excessive force claim ” ) .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
After a bench trial , the District Court ruled largely in favor of respondents . App . to Pet . for Cert . 135a–136a . The court found Deputy Conley liable on the warrantless entry claim , and the court also found both deputies liable on the knock - and - announce claim . But the court awarded nominal damages for these violations because “ the act of pointing the BB gun ” was a superseding cause “ as far as damage [ from the shooting was ] concerned . ” App . 238 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The District Court then addressed respondents’ excessive force claim . App . to Pet . for Cert . 105a–127a . The court began by evaluating whether the deputies used excessive force under Graham v. Connor , 490 U. S. 386 ( 1989 ) . The court held that , under Graham , the deputies’ use of force was reasonable “ given their belief that a man was holding a firearm rifle threatening their lives . ” App . to Pet . for Cert . 108a . But the court did not end its excessive force analysis at this point . Instead , the court turned to the Ninth Circuit ’s provocation rule , which holds that “ an officer ’s otherwise reasonable ( and lawful ) defensive use of force is unreasonable as a matter of law , if ( 1 ) the officer intentionally or recklessly provoked a violent response , and ( 2 ) that provocation is an independent constitutional violation . ” Id. , at 111a . Based on this rule , the District Court held the deputies liable for excessive force and awarded respondents around $ 4 million in damages . Id. , at 135a–136a .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part . 815 F. 3d 1178 ( CA9 2016 ) . Contrary to the District Court , the Court of Appeals held that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity on the knock - and - announce claim . Id. , at 1191–1193 . But the court concluded that the warrantless entry of the shack violated clearly established law and was attributable to both deputies . Id. , at 1191 , 1195 . Finally , and most important for present purposes , the court affirmed the application of the provocation rule . The Court of Appeals did not disagree with the conclusion that the shooting was reasonable under Graham ; instead , like the District Court , the Court of Appeals applied the provocation rule and held the deputies liable for the use of force on the theory that they had intentionally and recklessly brought about the shooting by entering the shack without a warrant in violation of clearly established law . 815 F. 3d , at 1193 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court of Appeals also adopted an alternative rationale for its judgment . It held that “ basic notions of proximate cause ” would support liability even without the provocation rule because it was “ reasonably foreseeable ” that the officers would meet an armed homeowner when they “ barged into the shack unannounced . ” Id. , at 1194–1195 .	@@empty@@	unmatched

The Ninth Circuit ’s provocation rule permits an excessive force claim under the Fourth Amendment “ where an officer intentionally or recklessly provokes a violent confrontation , if the provocation is an independent Fourth Amendment violation . ” Billington v. Smith , 292 F. 3d 1177 , 1189 ( CA9 2002 ) . The rule comes into play after a forceful seizure has been judged to be reasonable under Graham . Once a court has made that determination , the rule instructs the court to ask whether the law enforcement officer violated the Fourth Amendment in some other way in the course of events leading up to the seizure . If so , that separate Fourth Amendment violation may “ render the officer ’s otherwise reasonable defensive use of force unreasonable as a matter of law . ” Id. , at 1190–1191 .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
The provocation rule , which has been “ sharply questioned ” outside the Ninth Circuit , City and County of San Francisco v. Sheehan , 575 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ , n. 4 ( 2015 ) ( slip op . , at 14 , n. 4 ) , is incompatible with our excessive force jurisprudence . The rule ’s fundamental flaw is that it uses another constitutional violation to manufacture an excessive force claim where one would not otherwise exist .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Fourth Amendment prohibits “ unreasonable searches and seizures . ” “ [ R]easonableness is always the touchstone of Fourth Amendment analysis , ” Birchfield v. North Dakota , 579 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2016 ) ( slip op . , at 37 ) , and reasonableness is generally assessed by carefully weighing “ the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual ’s Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion . ” Tennessee v. Garner , 471 U. S. 1 , 8 ( 1985 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
Our case law sets forth a settled and exclusive framework for analyzing whether the force used in making a seizure complies with the Fourth Amendment . See Graham , 490 U. S. , at 395 . As in other areas of our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence , “ [ d]etermining whether the force used to effect a particular seizure is ‘ reasonable’ ” requires balancing of the individual ’s Fourth Amendment interests against the relevant government interests . Id. , at 396 . The operative question in excessive force cases is “ whether the totality of the circumstances justifie[s ] a particular sort of search or seizure . ” Garner , supra , at 8–9 .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
The reasonableness of the use of force is evaluated under an “ objective ” inquiry that pays “ careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case . ” Graham , supra , at 396 . And “ [ t]he ‘ reasonableness’ of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene , rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight . ” Ibid . “ Excessive force claims . . . are evaluated for objective reasonableness based upon the information the officers had when the conduct occurred . ” Saucier v. Katz , 533 U. S. 194 , 207 ( 2001 ) . That inquiry is dispositive : When an officer carries out a seizure that is reasonable , taking into account all relevant circumstances , there is no valid excessive force claim .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The basic problem with the provocation rule is that it fails to stop there . Instead , the rule provides a novel and unsupported path to liability in cases in which the use of force was reasonable . Specifically , it instructs courts to look back in time to see if there was a different Fourth Amendment violation that is somehow tied to the eventual use of force . That distinct violation , rather than the forceful seizure itself , may then serve as the foundation of the plaintiff ’s excessive force claim . Billington , supra , at 1190 ( “ The basis of liability for the subsequent use of force is the initial constitutional violation . . . ” ) .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
This approach mistakenly conflates distinct Fourth Amendment claims . Contrary to this approach , the objective reasonableness analysis must be conducted separately for each search or seizure that is alleged to be unconstitutional . An excessive force claim is a claim that a law enforcement officer carried out an unreasonable seizure through a use of force that was not justified under the relevant circumstances . It is not a claim that an officer used reasonable force after committing a distinct Fourth Amendment violation such as an unreasonable entry .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
By conflating excessive force claims with other Fourth Amendment claims , the provocation rule permits excessive force claims that can not succeed on their own terms . That is precisely how the rule operated in this case . The District Court found ( and the Ninth Circuit did not dispute ) that the use of force by the deputies was reasonable under Graham . However , respondents were still able to recover damages because the deputies committed a separate constitutional violation ( the warrantless entry into the shack ) that in some sense set the table for the use of force . That is wrong . The framework for analyzing excessive force claims is set out in Graham . If there is no excessive force claim under Graham , there is no excessive force claim at all . To the extent that a plaintiff has other Fourth Amendment claims , they should be analyzed separately . 1 *	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
The Ninth Circuit ’s efforts to cabin the provocation rule only undermine it further . The Ninth Circuit appears to recognize that it would be going entirely too far to suggest that any Fourth Amendment violation that is connected to a reasonable use of force should create a valid excessive force claim . See , e.g. , Beier v. Lewiston , 354 F. 3d 1058 , 1064 ( CA9 2004 ) ( “ Because the excessive force and false arrest factual inquiries are distinct , establishing a lack of probable cause to make an arrest does not establish an excessive force claim , and vice - versa ” ) . Instead , that court has endeavored to limit the rule to only those distinct Fourth Amendment violations that in some sense “ provoked ” the need to use force . The concept of provocation , in turn , has been defined using a two - prong test . First , the separate constitutional violation must “ creat[e ] a situation which led to ” the use of force ; second , the separate constitutional violation must be committed recklessly or intentionally . 815 F. 3d , at 1193 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
Neither of these limitations solves the fundamental problem of the provocation rule : namely , that it is an unwarranted and illogical expansion of Graham . But in addition , each of the limitations creates problems of its own . First , the rule includes a vague causal standard . It applies when a prior constitutional violation “ created a situation which led to ” the use of force . The rule does not incorporate the familiar proximate cause standard . Indeed , it is not clear what causal standard is being applied . Second , while the reasonableness of a search or seizure is almost always based on objective factors , see Whren v. United States , 517 U. S. 806 , 814 ( 1996 ) , the provocation rule looks to the subjective intent of the officers who carried out the seizure . As noted , under the Ninth Circuit ’s rule , a prior Fourth Amendment violation may be held to have provoked a later , reasonable use of force only if the prior violation was intentional or reckless .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
The provocation rule may be motivated by the notion that it is important to hold law enforcement officers liable for the foreseeable consequences of all of their constitutional torts . See Billington , 292 F. 3d , at 1190 ( “ [ I]f an officer ’s provocative actions are objectively unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment , . . . liability is established , and the question becomes . . . what harms the constitutional violation proximately caused ” ) . However , there is no need to distort the excessive force inquiry in order to accomplish this objective . To the contrary , both parties accept the principle that plaintiffs can — subject to qualified immunity — generally recover damages that are proximately caused by any Fourth Amendment violation . See , e.g. , Heck v. Humphrey , 512 U. S. 477 , 483 ( 1994 ) ( § 1983 “ creates a species of tort liability ” informed by tort principles regarding “ damages and the prerequisites for their recovery ” ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) ; Memphis Community School Dist . v. Stachura , 477 U. S. 299 , 306 ( 1986 ) ( “ [ W]hen § 1983 plaintiffs seek damages for violations of constitutional rights , the level of damages is ordinarily determined according to principles derived from the common law of torts ” ) . Thus , there is no need to dress up every Fourth Amendment claim as an excessive force claim . For example , if the plaintiffs in this case can not recover on their excessive force claim , that will not foreclose recovery for injuries proximately caused by the warrantless entry . The harm proximately caused by these two torts may overlap , but the two claims should not be confused .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23

The Court of Appeals also held that “ even without relying on [ the ] provocation theory , the deputies are liable for the shooting under basic notions of proximate cause . ” 815 F. 3d , at 1194 . In other words , the court apparently concluded that the shooting was proximately caused by the deputies’ warrantless entry of the shack . Proper analysis of this proximate cause question required consideration of the “ foreseeability or the scope of the risk created by the predicate conduct , ” and required the court to conclude that there was “ some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged . ” Paroline v. United States , 572 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2014 ) ( slip op . , at 7 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Unfortunately , the Court of Appeals’ proximate cause analysis appears to have been tainted by the same errors that cause us to reject the provocation rule . The court reasoned that when officers make a “ startling entry ” by “ barg[ing ] into ” a home “ unannounced , ” it is reasonably foreseeable that violence may result . 815 F. 3d , at 1194–1195 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . But this appears to focus solely on the risks foreseeably associated with the failure to knock and announce , which could not serve as the basis for liability since the Court of Appeals concluded that the officers had qualified immunity on that claim . By contrast , the Court of Appeals did not identify the foreseeable risks associated with the relevant constitutional violation ( the warrantless entry ) ; nor did it explain how , on these facts , respondents’ injuries were proximately caused by the warrantless entry . In other words , the Court of Appeals’ proximate cause analysis , like the provocation rule , conflated distinct Fourth Amendment claims and required only a murky causal link between the warrantless entry and the injuries attributed to it . On remand , the court should revisit the question whether proximate cause permits respondents to recover damages for their shooting injuries based on the deputies’ failure to secure a warrant at the outset . See Bank of America Corp. v. Miami , ante , at 12 ( declining to “ draw the precise boundaries of proximate cause ” in the first instance ) . The arguments made on this point by the parties and by the United States as amicus provide a useful starting point for this inquiry . See Brief for Petitioners 42–56 ; Brief for Respondents 20–31 , 51–59 ; Reply Brief 17–24 ; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26–32 .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23

The Illinois Grand Trunk Railway Company was incorporated in 1867 , under a special charter granted by the legislature of the state of Illinois . On June 25 , 1870 , the town of Lamoille voted to subscribe to the capital stock of the railway company to the amount of $ 30,000 , and to issue in payment therefor its bonds , payable in 10 years , of equal amount . On August 6 , 1870 , another election was held , at which the town voted to subscribe the further sum of $ 10,000 to the stock of the railway company , and to issue its bonds , in equal amount , in payment therefor . On February 1 , 1871 , in pursuance of these two elections , a subscription on behalf of the town was made , and its 40 bonds , for the sum of $ 1,000 each , were executed and delivered to the railway company , and a certificate for $ 40,000 of capital stock was issued by the railway company , and delivered to the town . These bonds were payable ' to bearer , ' and when received by the railway company were transferred by it to the Chicago , Burlington & Quincy Railroad Company , and by the latter were sold at 90 cents on the dollar . Thereafter , and in 1871 , the appellee bought the majority of these bonds , including therein the whole of the last $ 10,000 thereof , form Jacob R. Shephered & Co. , paying 99 cents on the dollar . No question is made as to the sufficiency or validity of this transfer , or as to the fact that the appellee acquired all the title of the Illinois Grand Trunk Railway Company , the original obligee , in the bonds . It appears that on July 2 , 1870 , this section of the Illinois constitution of 1870 , which had been separately submitted to and adopted by a vote of the people , went into effect : ' No county , city , town , township , or other municipality shall ever become subscriber to the capital stock of any railroad or private corporation , or make donation to or loan its credit in aid of such corporation : provided , however , that the adoption of this article shall not be construed as affecting the right of any such municipality to make such subscriptions where the same have been authorized , under existing laws , by a vote of the people of such municipalities prior to such adoption . ' 1 Starr & C. St. 167 . The effect of the adoption of this section was to render void the action of the town on August 6th , and invalidate the $ 10,000 of bonds issued in pursuance of that vote . Wade v. Walnut , 105 U. S. 1 , and cases cited in the opinion . On March 28 , 1885 , Wade , the holder of these $ 10,000 of void bonds , filed his bill in the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Illinois aganst the town of Lamoille and the Illinois Grand Trunk Railway Company , in which bill he tendered the bonds to the town for surrender and cancellation , and prayed that $ 10,000 of the $ 40,000 of stock issued by the railway company to the town be transferred to him . Both the Town and the rail way company filed answers ; the town simply putting the plaintiff to proof of his allegations , and asking that , if the plaintiff be decreed the title to the stock , the decree , so far as the town is concerned , be at his costs , and on condition of the surrender and cancellation of the bonds . The railway company answered , denying at length the principal allegations of plaintiff 's bill , and pleading laches and limitation , in addition , as a defense . After the testimony had been taken , and on June 24 , 1887 , a decree was entered in favor of the plaintiff , substantially directing that Wade deposit in the office of the clerk of the circuit court , for the benefit of the town , the $ 10,000 of bonds and their coupons , and that thereupon he be put into possession of $ 10,000 of the stock of the railway company held by the town . From this decree the railway company alone prosecutes an appeal ; the town being content to abide by its terms . In this respect it may be noticed that the plaintiff in his bill alleged that the people of the town of Lamoille were willing that he should have all the benefit and advantage which he could derive from said stock , but that the officers of the town refused to deliver the certificate . Appellant relies largely upon the case of Insurance Co. v. Middleport , 124 U. S. 534 , 8 Sup . Ct . Rep. 625 , and contends that under the authority of that case the plaintiff could not be subrogated to the rights of the town in this $ 10,000 of stock . It also contends that the subscription by the town to that amount of stock , and the issue by the railway company thereof , was itself a void transaction , and conferred no title on the town thereto ; and , finally , that laches and limitation constituted a good defense to plaintiff 's claim .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Assuming that the first contention of appellant might be of force if the town had joined in the appeal , we are of opinion that it is a defense which the railway company alone can not now make . By the decree , the rights of the town to that stock have been transferred to the plaintiff . The town not challenging the decree , it is final ; and the plaintiff , in respect to the rights of the town in the stock , stands in the same attitude that he would if the town had voluntarily transferred it to him . The railway company has no interest in protecting the rights of the town . It could not interfere to prevent a voluntary transfer of the stock , and it can not be heard to say that the town shall not abide by the terms of that decree ; so that the present appeal is to be considered by us precisely as though the town had voluntarily transferred the stock to the plaintiff , or as though he had in a different suit , and by a prior decree , obtained a transfer of its interest . There is therefore no matter of subrogation to be considered , and no inquiry into the extent to which this doctrine could be applied . The plaintiff has all the rights that the town had . Under those circumstances , can the railway company challenge this decree ? It insists that the whole transaction in respect to the $ 10,000 of stock between the town and itself was void ; but the facts , as disclosed , are that there were two votes to subscribe , one on June 25th , for $ 30,000 , and one on August 6th , for $ 10,000 , of stock . The validity of the first vote , and of the bonds issued thereunder , is not challenged . No separate subscriptions were made , but on February 1 , 1871 , one subscription of $ 40,000 was made by the town , and one certificate for 400 shares , of $ 100 each , issued by the railway company to the town . Can the legal title of the town to these 400 shares be doubted ? Clearly not . It has paid therefor $ 30,000 of valid securities . If it has not paid in full for the 400 shares , it has paid 75 per cent . of the amount due thref or ; and its title acquired	@@empty@@	unmatched
Kansas motor fuel tax applies to the receipt of fuel by off - reservation non - Indian distributors who subsequently deliver it to the gas station owned by , and located on the Reservation of , the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation ( Nation ) . The station is meant to accommodate reservation traffic , including patrons driving to the casino the Nation owns and operates there . Most of the stations fuel is sold to such patrons , but some sales are made to persons living or working on the reservation . The Nations own tax on the stations fuel sales generates revenue for reservation infrastructure . The Nation sued for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief from the States collection of its tax from distributors delivering fuel to the reservation . Granting the State summary judgment , the District Court determined that the balance of state , federal , and tribal interests tilted in favor of the State under the test set forth in White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker , 448 U. S. 136 . The Tenth Circuit reversed , agreeing with the Nation that the Kansas tax is an impermissible affront to its sovereignty . The court reasoned that the Nations fuel revenues were derived from value generated primarily on its reservation i.e. , the creation of a new fuel market by virtue of the casinoand that the Nations interests in taxing this reservation - created value to raise revenue for reservation infrastructure outweighed the States general interest in raising revenues .	@@empty@@	unmatched
( a ) Under this Courts Indian tax immunity cases , the who and the where of a challenged tax have significant consequences . The initial and frequently dispositive question … is who bears [ a taxs ] legal incidence, Oklahoma Tax Commn v. Chickasaw Nation , 515 U. S. 450 ( emphasis added ) . Moreover , the States are categorically barred from placing a taxs legal incidence  on a tribe or on tribal members for sales made inside Indian country  without congressional authorization . Id. , at 459 ( emphasis added ) . Even when a State imposes a taxs legal incidence on a non - Indian seller , the tax may nonetheless be pre - empted if the transaction giving rise to tax liability occurs on the reservation and the imposition of the tax fails to satisfy the Bracker interest - balancing test . See , e.g. , Central Machinery Co. v. Arizona Tax Commn , 448 U. S. 160 . Pp . 45 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
( b ) The Court rejects the Nations argument that it is entitled to prevail under Chickasaw s categorical bar because the fairest reading of the Kansas statute is that the taxs legal incidence actually falls on the Tribe on the reservation . Under the statute , the taxs incidence is expressly imposed on the distributor that first receives the fuel . Such dispositive language from the state legislature is determinative of who bears a state excise taxs legal incidence . Chickasaw , supra , at 461 . Even absent such dispositive language, the Court would nonetheless conclude that the taxs legal incidence is on the distributor because Kansas law makes clear that it is the distributor , not the retailer , that is liable for the tax . The lower courts and the Kansas agency charged with administering the motor fuel tax reached the same conclusion . Kaul v. Kansas Dept . of Revenue , 266 Kan. 464 , 970 P. 2d 60 , distinguished . Pp . 58 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
( c ) Also rejected is the Nations alternative argument that the Bracker test must be applied irrespective of who bears the Kansas taxs legal incidence because the tax arises as a result of the on - reservation sale and delivery of fuel . The Nation presented a starkly different , and correct , interpretation of the statute in the Tenth Circuit , arguing that the balancing test is appropriate even though the taxs legal incidence is imposed on the Nations non - Indian distributor and is triggered by the distributors receipt of fuel outside the reservation . The Nations argument here is rebutted by provisions of the Kansas statute demonstrating that the only taxable event occurs when the distributor first receives the fuel and by a final determination by the State reaching the same conclusion . The Nations theory that the existence of statutory deductions for certain postreceipt transactions make it impossible for a distributor to calculate its ultimate tax liability without knowing whether , where , and to whom the fuel is ultimately sold or delivered suffers from several conceptual defects . For example , availability of the deductions does not change the nature of the taxable event , the distributors receipt of the fuel . Pp . 812 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
2 . The Tenth Circuit erred in concluding that the Kansas tax is nevertheless subject to Bracker s test . That test applies only where a State asserts authority over the conduct of non - Indians engaging in activity on the reservation. 448 U. S. , at 144 . It has never been applied where , as here , a state tax imposed on a non - Indian arises from a transaction occurring off the reservation . The Courts Indian tax immunity cases counsel against such an application . Pp . 1218 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
( a ) Limiting the Bracker test exclusively to on - reservation transactions between a nontribal entity and a tribe or tribal member is consistent with this Courts unique Indian tax immunity jurisprudence , which relies heavily on the doctrine of tribal sovereignty [ giving ] state law no role to play within a tribes territorial boundaries, Oklahoma Tax Commn v. Sac and Fox Nation , 508 U. S. 114 . The Court has taken an altogether different course , by contrast , when a State asserts its taxing authority outside of Indian Country . E.g. , Chickasaw , 515 U. S. 450 . In such cases , [a]bsent express federal law to the contrary , Indians going beyond reservation boundaries have generally been held subject to non - discriminatory state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the State. Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones , 411 U. S. 145 . If a State may apply a nondiscriminatory tax to Indians who have gone beyond the reservations boundaries , it may also apply a nondiscriminatory tax where , as here , the tax is imposed on non - Indians as a result of an off - reservation transaction . In these circumstances , Bracker is inapplicable . Cf . Arizona Dept . of Revenue v. Blaze Constr . Co. , 526 U. S. 32 . The application of the test here is also inconsistent with the Courts efforts to establish bright line standard[s] in the tax administration context . Ibid . The Nation is not entitled to interest balancing by virtue of its claim that the Kansas tax interferes with the Nations own motor fuel tax . This is ultimately a complaint about the state taxs downstream economic consequences . The Nation can not invalidate that tax by complaining about a decrease in its revenues . See , e.g. , Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation , 447 U. S. 134 . Nor would the Courts analysis change if legal significance were accorded the Nations decision to label a portion of its gas stations revenues as tax proceeds . See i d . , at 184 , n. 9 . Pp . 1217 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
( b ) This Court rejects the Nations contention that the Kansas tax is invalid notwithstanding the Bracker tests inapplicability because it exempts from taxation fuel sold or delivered to state and federal sovereigns and is therefore impermissibly discriminatory . The Nation is not similarly situated to the exempted sovereigns . While Kansas tax pays for roads and bridges on the Nations reservation , including the main highway used by casino patrons , Kansas offers no such services to the several States or the Federal Government . Moreover , to the extent Kansas retailers bear the taxs cost , that burden applies equally to all retailers within the State regardless of whether they are located on a reservation .

The defendant 's capital stock was 1,000 shares of $ 100 each , the whole of which was in fact , and was alleged in the petition to have been , taken and paid for , and certificates therefor issued to the stockholders , at the time of its organization in 1864 . The president and cashier of the bank were charged with the keeping of its transfer - books and the issuing of certificates of stock , and the books of the bank were always open to the inspection of the directions . On July 15 , 1867 , G. Volney Dorsey was president and Robert B. Moores was cashier of the bank , and said Moores , who had previously owned 275 shares of the stock , appeared on the books of the bank to be still the owner thereof . He and John B. C. Moores , the plaintiff 's husband , were sons of William B. Moores . On that day the plaintiff agreed to lend $ 9,100 of her own money to Robert and William for use in their private business ; they agreed to give her , as security for its repayment , a certificate of 91 shares , which Robert represented to her that he owned , and also the contract of guaranty hereinafter set forth ; and Robert sent to the plaintiff 's husband , as her agent , the following letter and certificate :	@@empty@@	unmatched

Robert B. Moores surrendered no certificate to the bank , and made no transfer to the plaintiff on its books . The plaintiff had no other knowledge of the rule requiring the surrender of an old certificate of stock before the issue of a new one , or of any fraud on the part of Robert , than was obtained by her reading and possession of the certificate .

The plaintiff put in evidence two letters to her husband from Dorsey , the president of the bank,one dated June 25 , 1872 , stating that the writer had just learned that he held a certificate of stock purporting to be issued by the bank , and asking for its number , date , and amount ; and the other dated July 5 , 1872 , the body of which was as follows : ' There is no such certificate as mentioned in yours of June 27th on our books . No . 56 is marked on the stub in our certificate book ' destroyed , ' in R. B. Moores ' handwriting . Your wife 's name was never entered among our stockholders , and the certificate is a fraud .

Robert B. Moores and Dorsey , being called as witnesses for the defendant , testified that it had no interest in the transaction of July 15 , 1867 . Moores testified that at that date he had pledged to Jason Evans and other persons all the stock he had previously owned , and did not own any stock ; and that he issued the certificate to the plaintiff without any autority from the bank , or any knowledge of the other officers . Dorsey testified that he had no knowledge of the issue of the certificate until June 25 , 1872 , and that the bank never paid any dividends upon it ; and he produced the certificate book of the bank , which showed the stub of a certificate , in its regular order , corresponding in number with that produced by the plaintiff , and having the word ' destroyed ' upon it in the handwriting of Robert B. Moores .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The plaintiff offered in evidence , and the court declined to admit , the record of a meeting of the board of directors of the bank , on August 9 , 1869 , containing the following entry : ' On motion , the following resolution was adopted and ordered to be placed upon the minutes : Whereas , Robert B. Moores , who was the owner of 275 shares of the capital stock of this bank,evidenced by certificate No . forty - seven ( 47 ) for fifty shares , dated May 2 , 1867 ; certificate No . forty - eight ( 48 ) for fifty shares , dated May 2 , 1867 ; certificate No . forty - nine ( 49 ) for sixty - five shares , dated May 2 , 1867 ; certificate No . 53(53 ) for seventy shares , dated June 11 , 1867 ; and certificate No . fifty - four ( 54 ) for forty shares , dated June 11 , 1867became indebted to this bank in the sum of thirty - seven thousand two hundred and forty - seven 29 - 100 dollars , ( $ 37,247.29 , ) and did , on the sixteenth day of January , 1868 , transfer one hundred and eighty - five shares of said stock , and on the fifteenth day of May , 1869 , did transfer ten shares of said stock , on the books of this bank , to G. Volney Dorsey , in consideration that said G. Volney Dorsey pay to this bank the sum of nineteen thousand five hundred dollars of said indebtedness ; and whereas , Jason Evans , who became the holder of seventy shares of said stock , issued as aforesaid , and transferred to him by the said R. B. Moores on the books of this bank , September 4 , 1867 , as per certificate No . 59 , did , on the twentieth day of February , 1869 , transfer to G. Volney Dorsey , on the books of this bank , by his power of attorney , all his right , title , and interest in the same : therefore , said transfers , as hereinbefore stated , are approved and affirmed by the directors of this bank . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
The plaintiff also offered evidence that there were one or two other instances in which stock was issued by the cashier without any certificate being surrendered . But as she offered no evidence , other than the directors ' record of August 9 , 1869 , that the other officers of the bank had any knowledge at the time of such transactions , or subsequently recognized them , the court excluded the evidence . The plaintiff offered to prove that there was an arrangement between Robert and her husband , by which interest , equal to 10 per cent . on $ 9,100 , on a debt due from the latter to his father , was to be treated as dividends upon this stock . But the court excluded the evidence as immaterial .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The court instructed the jury that the plaintiff , having knowledge of the fact that Robert B. Moores , upon whom she relied to have the stock transferred to her , was acting for himself as well as in his capacity of cashier , in reference to the matter of issuing this certificate , she was not an innocent holder of the stock , and as the certificate was issued without authority , in fraud of the rights of the bank , they should return a verdict for the defendant . A verdict was returned accordingly , and judgment rendered thereon , and the plaintiff excepted to the exclusion of evidence and to this instruction , and sued out this writ of error .	@@empty@@	unmatched

The petition alleges that the false and fraudulent representations made by Robert B. Moores , and relied on by the plaintiff , that he had assigned and transferred the stock in question to her on the books of the bank , were made by him both as cashier and as stockholder ; that the bank afterwards fraudulently permitted and procured him to transfer all the stock owned by him , or standing in his name , to its president , for its benefit ; that the bank , through its cashier , fraudulently concealed from her the facts that no transfer had been made to her on its books at the time of the issue and delivery of the certificate to her ; that the certificate was not authorized or recognized as valid by the bank ; and that the stock standing in his name had been transferred on its books to its president ; and concludes by alleging that by reason of such fraudulent conduct and acts of the bank the certificate was invalid and worthless in her hands . But the evidence offered at the trial does not support the allegations of fraudulent conduct on the part of the bank .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The petition alleges ' that the plaintiff relied upon the representations of said Robert B. Moores , as cashier and officer of the defendant , that the said certificate was duly issued , and that the stock had been duly transferred by said Robert B. Moores to the plaintiff on the books of said bank ; and said plaintiff relied upon said certificate of stock which she received as genuine and valid for what it purported to be . ' And at the trial the plaintiff relied upon the representations made to her by Robert B. Moores , orally and in the letter inclosing the certificate , and in his contract of guaranty , as well as upon those arising out of the certificate itself . The two may be conveniently considered separately .	@@empty@@	unmatched
His representations outside of the certificate may be first disposed of . The plaintiff dealt with Robert B. Moores , and not with the bank . Her agreement was with him personally , and she lent her money to him for his private use . His representations to her that he owned stock in the bank , and that such stock had been transferred to her , were representations made by him personally , and not as cashier ; and there is no evidence that the plaintiff understood , or had any reason to understand , that those representations were made by him in behalf of the bank . The duty of transferring his stock to the plaintiff before taking out a new certificate in her name , was a duty that he , and not the bank , owed to the plaintiff . The making of such a transfer was an act to be done by him in his own behalf as between him and the plaintiff , and in the plaintiff 's behalf as between her and the bank . There is nothing , therefore , in his extrinsic representations for which the bank is responsible .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The certificate which he delivered to the plaintiff was not in his name , but in hers , stating that she was entitled to so much stock , and showed , upon its face , that no certificate could be lawfully issued without the surrender of a former certificate , and a transfer thereof upon the books of the bank . The by - laws , passed under the authority expressly conferred by the act of congress , under which the bank was organized , containing a corresponding provision , designed for the security of the bank , as well as of persons taking legal transfers of stock without notice of any prior equitable title therein . Union Bank v. Laird , 2 Wheat . 390 ; Black v. Zacharie , 3 How . 483 , 513 . The very form of the certificate was such as to put her upon her guard . She was not applying to the bank to take stock , as an original subscriber or other wise ; but she was bargaining with Robert B. Moores for stock which she supposed him to hold as his own . She knew that she had not held or surrendered any certificate , and she never asked to see his certificate , or a transfer thereof to her ; and he , in fact , made no surrender to the bank or transfer on its books . She relied on his personal representation , as the party with whom she was dealing , that he had such stock ; and she trusted him as her agent to see the proper transfer thereof made on the books of the bank . Having distinct notice that the surrender and transfer of a former certificate were prerequisites to the lawful issue of a new one , and having accepted a certificate that she owned stock , without taking any steps to assure herself that the legal prerequisites to the validity of her certificate , which were to be fulfilled by the former owner and not by the bank , had been complied with , she does not , as against the bank , stand in the position of one who receives a certificate of stock from the proper officers without notice of any facts impairing its validity .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Of the great number of cases referred to in the thorough and elaborate arguments at the bar , we shall notice only some of the most important . None of those cited by the learned counsel for the plaintiff affirm a broader proposition than this : A certificate of stock in a corporation , under the corporate seal , and signed by the officers authorized to issue certificates , estops the corporation to deny its validity , as against one who takes it for value and with no knowledge or notice of any fact tending to show that it has been irregularly issued .	@@empty@@	unmatched
When a corporation , upon the delivery to it of a certificate of stock with a forged power of attorney purporting to be executed by the rightful owner , issues a new certificate to the present holder , who sells it in the market to one who pays value for it , with no knowledge or notice of the forgery , the corporation is doubtless not relieved from its obligation to the original owner , out must still recognize him as a stockholder , because he can not be deprived of his property without any consent or negligence of his . Midland Ry . v. Taylor , 8 H. L. Cas . 751 ; Bank v. Lanier , 11 Wall . 369 ; Telegraph Co. v. Davenport , 97 U. S. 369 ; Pratt v. Taunton Copper Co. 123 Mass. 110 ; Pratt v. Boston & A. R. R. 126 Mass. 443 . And the corporation is obliged , if not to recognize the last purchaser as a stockholder also , at least to respond to him in damages for the value of the stock , because he has taken it for value without notice of any defect , and on the faith of the new certificate issued by the corporation . In re Bahia & S. F. Ry . L. R. 3 Q. B. 584 . Whether , before the last sale has taken place , the corporation is liable to the holder of the new certificate , is a question upon which there appears to have been a difference of opinion in England . According to the decision of Lord NORTHINGTON in Ashby v. Blackwell , 2 Eden , 299 , S. C. Ambler , 503 , it would seem that the corporation would be liable . According to the decisions of Sir JOSEPH JEKYLL in Hildyard v. South Sea Co. 2 P. Wms . 76 , and of the court of appeal Simm v. Anglo - American Tel . Co. 5 Q. B. Div . 188 , it would seem that it would not , because the holder of the new certificate takes it , not on the faith of that or any other certificate of the corporation , but on the faith of the forged power of attorney . However that may be , it is clear that the corporation is not liable to any one taking with notice of the forgery in the transfer , or of any other fact tending to show that the new certificate has been irregularly issued , unless the corporation has ratified or received some benefit from the transaction .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Robert Schuyler , the president and general transfer agent of the New York & New Haven Railroad Company , issued , beyond the capital limited by its charter , but in the form prescribed by its by - laws , purporting to be transferable on its books on surrender of the certificates , a large amount of certificates of stock , annexed to which were printed forms of assignment and power of attorney .	@@empty@@	unmatched

A person hwo takes such a security with knowledge that the conditions on which alone the security was authorized were not fulfilled , is not protected , and in his hands the security is invalid , though the imperfection is in some matter relating to the internal affairs of the corporation , which would be unavailable against a bona fide holder of the same security .

The general doctrine was stated with like limitations by this court in the case of Merchants ' Bank v. State Bank : ' Where a party deals with a corporation in good faith , the transaction is not ultra vires , and he is unaware of any defect of authority or other irregularity on the part of those acting for the corporation , and there is nothing to excite suspicion of such defect or irregularity , the corporation is bound by the contract , although such defect or irregularity in fact exists . ' 10 Wall . 604 , 644 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This review of the cases shows that there is no precedent for holding that the plaintiff , having dealt with the cashier individually , and lent money to him for his private use , and received from him a certificate in her own name , which stated that shares were transferable only on the books of the bank and on surrender of former certificates , and no certificate having been surrendered by him or by her , and there being no evidence of the bank having ratified or received any benefit from the transaction , can recover from the bank the value of the certificate delivered to her by its cashier .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The exceptions to the exclusion of evidence can not be sustained . The evidence that in one or two other instances stock was issued by the cashier without the surrender of old certificates , and that the directors of the bank approved certain transfers to its president of shares once belonging to the cashier , was quite insufficient to prove that the bank ratified or received any benefit from the issue of the certificate to the plaintiff , or was guilty of any fraud towards her . The action of the directors was adapted to the single purpose of securing payment of a debt due from the cashier to the bank . The evidence introduced and offered being insufficient to support a verdict for the plaintiff , the circuit court rightly directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant . Randall v.

Arizona prisoners may raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel only in state collateral proceedings , not on direct review . In petitioner Martinez ’s first state collateral proceeding , his counsel did not raise such a claim . On federal habeas review with new counsel , Martinez argued that he received ineffective assistance both at trial and in his first state collateral proceeding . He also claimed that he had a constitutional right to an effective attorney in the collateral proceeding because it was the first place to raise his claim of ineffective assistance at trial . The District Court denied the petition , finding that Arizona ’s preclusion rule was an adequate and independent state - law ground barring federal review , and that under Coleman v. Thompson , 501 U. S. 722 , the attorney ’s errors in the postconviction proceeding did not qualify as cause to excuse the procedural default .

LUIS MARIANO MARTINEZ , PETITIONER v . CHARLES L. RYAN , DIRECTOR , ARIZONADEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS	@@empty@@	unmatched
The State of Arizona does not permit a convicted person alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel to raise that claim on direct review . Instead , the prisoner must bring the claim in state collateral proceedings . In the instant case , however , petitioner ’s postconviction counsel did not raise the ineffective - assistance claim in the first collateral proceeding , and , indeed , filed a statement that , after reviewing the case , she found no meritorious claims helpful to petitioner . On federal habeas review , and with new counsel , petitioner sought to argue he had received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and in the first phase of his state collateral proceeding . Because the state collateral proceeding was the first place to challenge his con - viction on grounds of ineffective assistance , petitioner maintained he had a constitutional right to an effective attorney in the collateral proceeding . While petitioner frames the question in this case as a constitutional one , a more narrow , but still dispositive , formulation is whether a federal habeas court may excuse a procedural default of an ineffective - assistance claim when the claim was not properly presented in state court due to an attorney ’s errors in an initial - review collateral proceeding .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A jury convicted petitioner , Luis Mariano Martinez , of two counts of sexual conduct with a minor under the ageof 15 . The prosecution introduced a videotaped forensic interview with the victim , Martinez ’s 11-year - old stepdaughter . It also put in evidence the victim ’s nightgown , with traces of Martinez ’s DNA . As part of his defense , Martinez introduced evidence of the victim ’s recantations , including testimony from the victim ’s grandmother and mother and a second videotaped interview in which the victim denied any abuse . The victim also denied any abuse when she testified at trial . App . to Pet . for Cert . 38a–39a . To explain the inconsistencies , a prosecution expert testified that recantations of child - abuse accusations are caused often by reluctance on the part of the victim ’s mother to lend support to the child ’s claims .

While Martinez ’s direct appeal was pending , the attorney began a state collateral proceeding by filing a “ Notice of Post - Conviction Relief . ” Martinez v. Schriro , 623 F. 3d 731 , 733–734 ( CA9 2010 ) ; Ariz. Rule Crim . Proc . 32.4(a ) ( 2011 ) .

The state trial court hearing the collateral proceeding gave Martinez 45 days to file a pro se petition in support of postconviction relief and to raise any claims he believed his counsel overlooked . 623 F. 3d , at 734 ; see Smith , supra , at 459 , 910 P. 2d , at 4 . Martinez did not respond . He later alleged that he was unaware of the ongoing collateral proceedings and that counsel failed to advise him of the need to file a pro se petition to preserve his rights . The state trial court dismissed the action for postconviction relief , in effect affirming counsel ’s determination that Martinez had no meritorious claims . 623 F. 3d , at 734 . The Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed Martinez ’s conviction , and the Arizona Supreme Court denied review . Id. , at 733 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
About a year and a half later , Martinez , now represented by new counsel , filed a second notice of postconviction relief in the Arizona trial court . Id. , at 734 . Martinez claimed his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to challenge the prosecution ’s evidence . He argued , for example , that his trial counsel should have objected to the expert testimony explaining the victim ’s recantations or should have called an expert witness in rebuttal . Martinez also faulted trial counsel for not pursuing an exculpatory explanation for the DNA on the nightgown . App . to Brief in Opposition B–6 to B–12 . Martinez ’s petition was dismissed , in part in reliance on an Arizona Rule barring relief on a claim that could have been raised in a previous collateral proceeding . Id. , at B–27 ; see Ariz. Rule Crim . Proc . 32.2(a)(3 ) . Martinez , the theory went , should have asserted the claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in his first notice for postconviction relief . The Arizona Court of Appeals agreed . It denied Martinez relief because he failed to raise his claims in the first collateral proceeding . 623 F. 3d , at 734 . The Arizona Supreme Court declined to review Martinez ’s appeal .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Martinez then sought relief in United States District Court for the District of Arizona , where he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus , again raising the ineffective - assistance - of - trial - counsel claims . Martinez acknowledged the state courts denied his claims by relying on a well - established state procedural rule , which , under the doctrine of procedural default , would prohibit a federal court from reaching the merits of the claims . See , e.g. , Wainwright v. Sykes , 433 U. S. 72–85 , 90–91 ( 1977 ) . He could overcome this hurdle to federal review , Martinez argued , because he had cause for the default : His first postconviction counsel was ineffective in failing to raise any claims in the first notice of postconviction relief and in failing to notify Martinez of her actions . See i d . , at 84–85 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On the Magistrate Judge ’s recommendation , the District Court denied the petition , ruling that Arizona ’s preclusion rule was an adequate and independent state - law ground to bar federal review . App . to Pet . for Cert . 36a . Martinez had not shown cause to excuse the procedural default , the District Court reasoned , because under Coleman v. Thompson , 501 U. S. 722–754 ( 1991 ) , an attorney ’s errors in a postconviction proceeding do not qualify as cause for a default . See i d . , at 754–755 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed . The Court of Appeals relied on general statements in Coleman that , absent a right to counsel in a collateral proceeding , an attorney ’s errors in the proceeding do not establish cause for a procedural default . Expanding on the District Court ’s opinion , the Court of Appeals , citing Coleman , noted the general rule that there is no constitutional right to counsel in collateral proceedings . 623 F. 3d , at 736 . The Court of Appeals recognized that Coleman reserved ruling on whether there is “ an exception ” to this rule in those cases “ where ‘ state collateral review is the first place a prisoner can present a challenge to his conviction.’ ” 623 F. 3d , at 736 ( quoting Coleman , supra , at 755 ) . It concluded , nevertheless , that the controlling cases established no basis for the exception . Certiorari was granted . 563 U. S. _ _ _ ( 2011 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Coleman v. Thompson , supra , left open , and the Court of Appeals in this case addressed , a question of constitutional law : whether a prisoner has a right to effective counsel in collateral proceedings which provide the first occasion to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial . These proceedings can be called , for purposes of this opinion , “ initial - review collateral proceedings . ” Coleman had sug - gested , though without holding , that the Constitutionmay require States to provide counsel in initial - review collateral proceedings because “ in [ these ] cases . . . state collateral review is the first place a prisoner can present a challenge to his conviction . ” Id. , at 755 . As Coleman noted , this makes the initial - review collateral proceeding a prisoner ’s “ one and only appeal ” as to an ineffective - assistance claim , i d . , at 756 ( emphasis deleted ; internal quotation marks omitted ) , and this may justify an exception to the constitutional rule that there is no right to counsel in collateral proceedings . See i d . , at 755 ; Douglas v. California , 372 U. S. 353 , 357 ( 1963 ) ( holding States must appoint counsel on a prisoner ’s first appeal ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This is not the case , however , to resolve whether that exception exists as a constitutional matter . The pre - cise question here is whether ineffective assistance in an initial - review collateral proceeding on a claim of ineffective assistance at trial may provide cause for a procedural default in a federal habeas proceeding . To protect prisoners with a potentially legitimate claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel , it is necessary to modify the unqualified statement in Coleman that an attorney ’s ignoranceor inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a procedural default . This opinion qualifies Coleman by recognizing a narrow exception : Inadequate assistance of counsel at initial - review collateral proceedings may establish cause for a prisoner ’s procedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance at trial .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Federal habeas courts reviewing the constitutionality of a state prisoner ’s conviction and sentence are guided by rules designed to ensure that state - court judgments are accorded the finality and respect necessary to preserve the integrity of legal proceedings within our system of federalism . These rules include the doctrine of procedural default , under which a federal court will not review the merits of claims , including constitutional claims , that a state court declined to hear because the prisoner failed to abide by a state procedural rule . See , e.g. , Coleman , supra , at 747–748 ; Sykes , supra , at 84–85 . A state court ’s invocation of a procedural rule to deny a prisoner ’s claims precludes federal review of the claims if , among other requisites , the state procedural rule is a nonfederal ground adequate to support the judgment and the rule is firmly established and consistently followed . See , e.g. , Walker v. Martin , 562 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2011 ) ( slip op . , at 7–8 ) ; Beard v. Kindler , 558 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2009 ) ( slip op . , at 7 ) . The doctrine barring procedurally defaulted claims from being heard is not without exceptions . A prisoner may obtain federal review of a defaulted claim by showing cause for the default and prejudice from a violation of federal law . See Coleman , 501 U. S. , at 750 . There is no dispute that Arizona ’s procedural bar on successive petitions is an independent and adequate state ground . Thus , a federal court can hear Martinez ’s ineffective - assistance claim only if he can establish cause to excuse the procedural default .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Coleman held that “ [ n]egligence on the part of a prisoner ’s postconviction attorney does not qualify as ‘ cause.’ ” Maples v. Thomas , 565 U. S _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2011 ) ( slip op . , at 12 ) . Coleman reasoned that “ because the attorney is the prisoner ’s agent . . . under ‘ well - settled principles of agency law,’ the principal bears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of his agent . ” Maples , supra , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 12 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Coleman , however , did not present the occasion to apply this principle to determine whether attorney errors in initial - review collateral proceedings may qualify as cause for a procedural default . The alleged failure of counsel in Coleman was on appeal from an initial - review collateral proceeding , and in that proceeding the prisoner ’s claims had been addressed by the state habeas trial court . See 501 U. S. , at 755 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
As Coleman recognized , this marks a key difference between initial - review collateral proceedings and other kinds of collateral proceedings . When an attorney errs in initial - review collateral proceedings , it is likely that no state court at any level will hear the prisoner ’s claim . This Court on direct review of the state proceeding could not consider or adjudicate the claim . See , e.g. , Fox Film Corp. v. Muller , 296 U. S. 207 ( 1935 ) ; Murdock v. Memphis , 20 Wall . 590 ( 1875 ) ; cf . Coleman , supra , at 730–731 . And if counsel ’s errors in an initial - review collateral proceeding do not establish cause to excuse the procedural default in a federal habeas proceeding , no court will review the prisoner ’s claims .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The same is not true when counsel errs in other kinds of postconviction proceedings . While counsel ’s errors in these proceedings preclude any further review of the prisoner ’s claim , the claim will have been addressed by one court , whether it be the trial court , the appellate court on direct review , or the trial court in an initial - review collateral proceeding . See , e.g. , Coleman , supra , at 756 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Where , as here , the initial - review collateral proceeding is the first designated proceeding for a prisoner to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial , the collateral proceeding is in many ways the equivalent of a prisoner ’s direct appeal as to the ineffective - assistance claim . Thisis because the state habeas court “ looks to the merits of the clai[m ] ” of ineffective assistance , no other court has addressed the claim , and “ defendants pursuing first - tier review . . . are generally ill equipped to represent themselves ” because they do not have a brief from counsel or an opinion of the court addressing their claim of error . Halbert v. Michigan , 545 U. S. 605 , 617 ( 2005 ) ; see Douglas , 372 U. S. , at 357–358 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
As Coleman recognized , an attorney ’s errors during an appeal on direct review may provide cause to excuse a procedural default ; for if the attorney appointed by the State to pursue the direct appeal is ineffective , the prisoner has been denied fair process and the opportunity to comply with the State ’s procedures and obtain an adjudication on the merits of his claims . See 501 U. S. , at 754 ; Evitts v. Lucey , 469 U. S. 387 , 396 ( 1985 ) ; Douglas , supra , at 357–358 . Without the help of an adequate attorney , a prisoner will have similar difficulties vindicating a substantial ineffective - assistance - of - trial - counsel claim . Claims of ineffective assistance at trial often require investigative work and an understanding of trial strategy . When the issue can not be raised on direct review , more - over , a prisoner asserting an ineffective - assistance - of - trial - counsel claim in an initial - review collateral proceeding can not rely on a court opinion or the prior work of an attorney addressing that claim . Halbert , 545 U. S. , at 619 . To present a claim of ineffective assistance at trial in accordance with the State ’s procedures , then , a prisoner likely needs an effective attorney .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The same would be true if the State did not appoint an attorney to assist the prisoner in the initial - review collateral proceeding . The prisoner , unlearned in the law , may not comply with the State ’s procedural rules or may misapprehend the substantive details of federal constitutional law . Cf . , e.g. , i d . , at 620–621 ( describing the educational background of the prison population ) . While confined to prison , the prisoner is in no position to develop the evidentiary basis for a claim of ineffective assistance , which often turns on evidence outside the trial record .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A prisoner ’s inability to present a claim of trial error is of particular concern when the claim is one of ineffective assistance of counsel . The right to the effective assistance of counsel at trial is a bedrock principle in our justice system . It is deemed as an “ obvious truth ” the idea that “ any person haled into court , who is too poor to hire a lawyer , can not be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him . ” Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U. S. 335 , 344 ( 1963 ) . Indeed , the right to counsel is the foundation for our adversary system . Defense counsel tests the pros - ecution ’s case to ensure that the proceedings serve the function of adjudicating guilt or innocence , while protecting the rights of the person charged . See , e.g. , Powell v. Alabama , 287 U. S. 45–69 ( 1932 ) ( “ [ The defendant ] requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him . Without it , though he be not guilty , he faces the danger of conviction because he does not know how to establish his innocence ” ) . Effective trial counsel preserves claims to be considered on appeal , see , e.g. , Fed . Rule Crim . Proc . 52(b ) , and in federal habeas proceedings , Edwards v. Carpenter , 529 U. S. 446 ( 2000 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This is not to imply the State acted with any impropri - ety by reserving the claim of ineffective assistance for a collateral proceeding . See Massaro v. United States , 538 U. S. 500 , 505 ( 2003 ) . Ineffective - assistance claims often depend on evidence outside the trial record . Direct appeals , without evidentiary hearings , may not be as effective as other proceedings for developing the factual basis for the claim . Ibid . Abbreviated deadlines to expand the record on direct appeal may not allow adequate time for an attorney to investigate the ineffective - assistance claim . See Primus , Structural Reform in Criminal Defense , 92 Cornell L. Rev. 679 , 689 , and n. 57 ( 2004 ) ( most rules give between 5 and 30 days from the time of conviction to file a request to expand the record on appeal ) . Thus , there are sound reasons for deferring consideration of ineffective - assistance - of - trial - counsel claims until the collateral - review stage , but this decision is not without consequences for the State ’s ability to assert a procedural default in later proceedings . By deliberately choosing to move trial - ineffectiveness claims outside of the direct - appeal process , where counsel is constitutionally guaranteed , the State significantly diminishes prisoners’ ability to file such claims . It is within the context of this state procedural framework that counsel ’s ineffectiveness in an initial - review collateral proceeding qualifies as cause for a procedural default .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The rules for when a prisoner may establish cause to excuse a procedural default are elaborated in the exercise of the Court ’s discretion . McCleskey v. Zant , 499 U. S. 467 , 490 ( 1991 ) ; see also Coleman , supra , at 730–731 ; Sykes , 433 U. S. , at 83 ; Reed v. Ross , 468 U. S. 1 , 9 ( 1984 ) ; Fay v. Noia , 372 U. S. 391 , 430 ( 1963 ) , overruled in part by Sykes , supra . These rules reflect an equitable judgment that only where a prisoner is impeded or obstructed in complying with the State ’s established procedures will a federal habeas court excuse the prisoner from the usual sanction of default . See , e.g. , Strickler v. Greene , 527 U. S. 263 , 289 ( 1999 ) ; Reed , supra , at 16 . Allowing a federal habeas court to hear a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel when an attorney ’s errors ( or the absence of an attorney ) caused a procedural default in an initial - review collateral proceeding acknowledges , as an equitable matter , that the initial - review collateral proceeding , if undertaken without counsel or with ineffective counsel , may not have been sufficient to ensure that proper consideration was given to a substantial claim . From this it follows that , when a State requires a prisoner to raise an ineffective - assistance - of - trial - counsel claim in a collateral proceeding , a prisoner may establish cause for a default of an ineffective - assistance claim in two circumstances . The first is where the state courts did not appoint counsel in the initial - review collateral proceeding for a claim of ineffective assistance at trial . The second is where appointed counsel in the initial - review collateral proceeding , where the claim should have been raised , was ineffective under the standards of Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 ( 1984 ) . To overcome the default , a prisoner must also demonstrate that the underlying ineffective - assistance - of - trial - counsel claim is a substantial one , which is to say that the prisoner must demonstrate that the claim has some merit . Cf . Miller - El v. Cockrell , 537 U. S. 322 ( 2003 ) ( describing standards for certificates of appealability to issue ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Most jurisdictions have in place procedures to ensure counsel is appointed for substantial ineffective - assistance claims . Some States , including Arizona , appoint counsel in every first collateral proceeding . See , e.g. , Alaska Stat . 18.85.100(c ) ( 2010 ) ; Ariz. Rule Crim . Proc . 32.4(c)(2 ) ( 2011 ) ; Conn. Gen. Stat . § 51–296(a ) ( 2011 ) ; Me . Rules Crim . Proc . 69 , 70(c ) ( 2010 ) ; N. C. Gen. Stat . Ann . § 7A–451(a)(2 ) ( 2009 ) ; N. J. Ct . Rule 3:22–6(b ) ( 2012 ) ; R. I. Gen. Laws § 10–9.1–5 ( Lexis 1997 ) ; Tenn. Code Ann . § 8–14–205 ( 2011 ) . Some States appoint counsel if the claims require an evidentiary hearing , as claims of ineffective assistance often do . See , e.g. , Ky. Rule Crim . Proc . 11.42(5 ) ( 2011 ) ; La. Code Crim . Proc . Ann . , Art . 930.7(C ) ( West 2008 ) ; Mich. Rule Crim . Proc . 6.505(A ) ( 2011 ) ; S. C. Rule Civ . Proc . 71.1(d ) ( 2011 ) . Other States appoint counsel if the claims have some merit to them or the state habeas trial court deems the record worthy of further development . See , e.g. , Ark. Rule Crim . Proc . 37.3(b ) ( 2011 ) ; Colo. Rule Crim . Proc . 35(b ) ( 2011 ) ; Del. Super . Ct . Rule Crim .

People , 167 Colo. 317 , 447 P. 2d 536 ( 1968 ) . It is likely that most of the attorneys appointed by the courts are qualified to per - form , and do perform , according to prevailing professional norms ; and , where that is so , the States may enforce a procedural default in federal habeas proceedings .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This limited qualification to Coleman does not implicate the usual concerns with upsetting reliance interests protected by stare decisis principles . Cf . , e.g. , Montejo v. Louisiana , 556 U. S. 778–793 ( 2009 ) . Coleman held that an attorney ’s negligence in a postconviction proceeding does not establish cause , and this remains true except as to initial - review collateral proceedings for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial . Coleman itself did not involve an occasion when an attorney erred in an initial - review collateral proceeding with respect to a claim of ineffective trial counsel ; and in the 20 years since Coleman was decided , we have not held Coleman applies in circumstances like this one .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The holding here ought not to put a significant strain on state resources . When faced with the question whether there is cause for an apparent default , a State may answer that the ineffective - assistance - of - trial - counsel claim is in - substantial , i.e. , it does not have any merit or that it is wholly without factual support , or that the attorney in the initial - review collateral proceeding did not perform below constitutional standards .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This is but one of the differences between a constitutional ruling and the equitable ruling of this case . A constitutional ruling would provide defendants a freestanding constitutional claim to raise ; it would require the appointment of counsel in initial - review collateral proceedings ; it would impose the same system of appointing counsel in every State ; and it would require a reversal in all state collateral cases on direct review from state courts if the States’ system of appointing counsel did not conform to the constitutional rule . An equitable ruling , by contrast , permits States a variety of systems for appointing counsel in initial - review collateral proceedings . And it permits a State to elect between appointing counsel in initial - review collateral proceedings or not asserting a procedural default and raising a defense on the merits in federal habeas proceedings . In addition , state collateral cases on direct review from state courts are unaffected by the ruling in this case .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The rule of Coleman governs in all but the limited circumstances recognized here . The holding in this case does not concern attorney errors in other kinds of proceedings , including appeals from initial - review collateral proceedings , second or successive collateral proceedings , and petitions for discretionary review in a State ’s appellate courts . See 501 U. S. , at 754 ; Carrier , 477 U. S. , at 488 . It does not extend to attorney errors in any proceeding beyond the first occasion the State allows a prisoner to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial , even though that initial - review collateral proceeding may be deficient for other reasons .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In addition , the limited nature of the qualification to Coleman adopted here reflects the importance of the right to the effective assistance of trial counsel and Arizona ’s decision to bar defendants from raising ineffective - assistance claims on direct appeal . Our holding here addresses only the constitutional claims presented in this case , where the State barred the defendant from raising the claims on direct appeal .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Arizona contends that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 ( AEDPA ) , 28 U. S. C. § 2254 , bars Martinez from asserting attorney error as cause fora procedural default . AEDPA refers to attorney error in collateral proceedings , but it does not speak to the question presented in this case . Section 2254(i ) provides that “ the ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during Federal or State collateral post - conviction proceedings shall not be a ground for relief . ” “ Cause , ” however , is not synonymous with “ a ground for relief . ” A finding of cause and prejudice does not entitle the prisoner to habeas relief . It merely allows a federal court to consider the merits ofa claim that otherwise would have been procedurally de - faulted . In this case , for example , Martinez ’s “ ground for relief ” is his ineffective - assistance - of - trial - counsel claim , a claim that AEDPA does not bar . Martinez relies on the ineffectiveness of his postconviction attorney to excuse his failure to comply with Arizona ’s procedural rules , not as an independent basis for overturning his conviction . In short , while § 2254(i ) precludes Martinez from relying on the ineffectiveness of his postconviction attorney as a “ ground for relief , ” it does not stop Martinez from using it to establish “ cause . ” Holland v. Florida , 560 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2010 ) ( slip op . , at 18 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Where , under state law , claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel must be raised in an initial - review collateral proceeding , a procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective assistance at trial if , in the initial - review collateral proceeding , there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In this case Martinez ’s attorney in the initial - review collateral proceeding filed a notice akin to an Anders brief , in effect conceding that Martinez lacked any meritorious claim , including his claim of ineffective assistance at trial . See Anders v. California , 386 U. S. 738 ( 1967 ) . Martinez argued before the federal habeas court that filing the Anders brief constituted ineffective assistance . The Court of Appeals did not decide whether that was so . Rather , it held that because Martinez did not have a right to an attorney in the initial - review collateral proceeding , the attorney ’s errors in the initial - review collateral proceeding could not establish cause for the failure to comply with the State ’s rules . Thus , the Court of Appeals did not determine whether Martinez ’s attorney in his first collateral proceeding was ineffective or whether his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel is substantial . And the court did not address the question of prejudice . These issues remain open for a decision on remand .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Let me get this straight : Out of concern for the values of federalism ; to preserve the ability of our States to provide prompt justice ; and in light of our longstanding juris - prudence holding that there is no constitutional right to counsel in state collateral review ; the Court , in what it portrays as an admirable exercise of judicial restraint , abstains from holding that there is a constitutional right to counsel in initial - review state habeas . After all , that would have meant , in a case such as the one before us , that failing to provide assistance of counsel , or providing assistance of counsel that falls below the Strickland standard , would constitute cause for excusing procedural default . See Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 ( 1984 ) . Instead of taking that radical step , the Court holds that , for equitable reasons , in a case such as the one before us , failing to provide assistance of counsel , or providing assistance of counsel that falls below the Strickland standard , constitutes cause for excusing procedural default . The result , of course , is precisely the same .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Ah , but perhaps the explanation of why the Court ’s action today amounts to praiseworthy self - restraint is this : It pronounces this excuse from the usual rule of proce - dural default only in initial - review state habeas raising an ineffective - assistance - of - trial - counsel claim . But it could have limited its invention of a new constitutional right to collateral - review counsel in precisely the same fashion — and with precisely the same consequences . Moreover , no one really believes that the newly announced “ equitable ” rule will remain limited to ineffective - assistance - of - trial - counsel cases . There is not a dime ’s worth of differencein principle between those cases and many other cases in which initial state habeas will be the first opportunity for a particular claim to be raised : claims of “ newly discovered ” prosecutorial misconduct , for example , see Brady v. Maryland , 373 U. S. 83 ( 1963 ) , claims based on “ newly discovered ” exculpatory evidence or “ newly discovered ” impeachment of prosecutorial witnesses , and claims asserting ineffective assistance of appellate counsel . The Court ’s soothing assertion , ante , at 14 , that its holding “ addresses only the constitutional claims presented in this case , ” insults the reader ’s intelligence . 1	@@empty@@	unmatched
Moreover , even if today ’s holding could ( against all logic ) be restricted to ineffective - assistance - of - trial - counsel claims , it would have essentially the same practical consequences as a holding that collateral - review counsel is constitutionally required . Despite the Court ’s suggestion to the contrary , see ante , at 13 , the rule it adopts calls into question the common state practice of not appointing counsel in all first collateral proceedings , see ante , at 11–12 . It does not , to be sure , call into question the lawfulness of that practice ; only its sanity . For if the prisoner goes through state collateral proceedings without counsel , and fails to raise an ineffective - assistance - of - trial - counsel claim which is , because of that failure , defaulted , the default will not preclude federal habeas review of the merits of that claim . And since ineffective assistance of trial counsel is a monotonously standard claim on federal habeas ( has a duly convicted defendant ever been effectively represented ? ) , whoever advises the State would himself be guilty of ineffective assistance if he did not counselthe appointment of state - collateral - review counsel in all cases — lest the failure to raise that claim in the state pro - ceedings be excused and the State be propelled into federal habeas review of the adequacy of trial - court representation that occurred many years ago . 2 Which is to say that the Court ’s pretended avoidance of requiring States to ap - point collateral - review counsel is a sham . 3	@@empty@@	unmatched
Of course even the appointment of state - collateral - review counsel will not guarantee that the State ’s criminal proceeding can be concluded without years - long federal retrial . Appointment of counsel may , as I have said , avoid federal review of the adequacy of representation that occurred years ago , at the original trial . But since , under today ’s opinion , the condition for exclusion of federal habeas is the very same condition that would apply if appointment of state - collateral - review counsel were constitutionally required , it will remain to be determined in federal habeas review whether the state - appointed counsel was effective . Thus , as a consequence of today ’s decision the States will always be forced to litigate in federal habeas , for all defaulted ineffective - assistance - of - trial - counsel claims ( and who knows what other claims ) , either ( 1 ) the validity of the defaulted claim ( where collateral - review counsel was not appointed ) , or ( 2 ) the effectiveness of collateral - review counsel ( where collateral - review counsel was appointed ) . The Court notes that many States already provide for the appointment of counsel in first collateral challenges — as though this proves that what the Court forces the States to do today is eminently reasonable . But what the Court fails to point out is that currently , when state - appointed counsel does not raise an ineffective - assistance - of - trial - counsel claim , that is the end of the matter : The issue has been procedurally defaulted . By virtue of today ’s opinion , however , all those cases can ( and where capital punishment is at issue assuredly will ) proceed to federal habeas on the issue of whether state - appointed counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the ineffective - assistance - of - trial - counsel issue . That is the meaning of the Court ’s ( supposedly comforting ) statement :	@@empty@@	unmatched
“ It is likely that most of the attorneys appointed by the courts are qualified to perform , and do perform , according to prevailing professional norms ; and , where that is so , the States may enforce a procedural default in federal habeas proceedings . ” Ante , at 12 ( emphasis added ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
To be more precise , the Court should have said “ where that is so , and where federal habeas courts have finally rejected claims that it is not so , the States may enforce a procedural default in federal habeas proceedings . ”	@@empty@@	unmatched
I can not possibly imagine the basis for the Court ’s confidence , ante , at 12–13 , that all this will not put a significant strain on state resources . The principal escape route from federal habeas — existence of an “ adequate and in - dependent state ground”—has been closed . 4 Whether counsel appointed for state collateral review raises the ineffective - assistance - of - trial - counsel claim or not , federal habeas review will proceed . In practical effect , that may not make much difference in noncapital cases ( except for the squandering of state taxpayers’ money ) : The defendant will stay in prison , continuing to serve his sentence , while federal habeas review grinds on . But in capital cases , it will effectively reduce the sentence , giving the defendant as many more years to live , beyond the lives of the innocent victims whose life he snuffed out , as the process of federal habeas may consume . I guarantee that an assertion of ineffective assistance of trial counsel will be made in all capital cases from this date on , causing ( because of today ’s holding ) execution of the sentence to be deferred until either that claim , or the claim that appointed counsel was ineffective in failing to make that claim , has worked its way through the federal system .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court would have us believe that today ’s holdingis no more than a “ limited qualification ” to Coleman v. Thompson , 501 U. S. 722 ( 1991 ) . Ante , at 12 . It is much more than that : a repudiation of the longstanding principle governing procedural default , which Coleman and other cases consistently applied . Coleman itself involved a habeas petitioner ’s contention that his attorney ’s failure to file a timely notice of appeal in his state habeas proceeding , which resulted in procedural default of the claims raised in that proceeding , was cause to excuse that default in federal habeas . 501 U. S. , at 752 . The petitioner in that case contended that whether a violation of his constitutional right to effective counsel had occurred was of no consequence , so long as the attorney ’s conduct fell short of the effectiveness standard set forth in Strickland . See 501 U. S. , at 753 . Whereas Coleman flatly repudiated that claim as being inconsistent with our precedent , see ibid . , today ’s majority wholeheartedly embraces it , ante , at 11 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Rejection of the argument in Coleman was compelled by our jurisprudence pertaining to cause for excusing procedural default , and in particular Murray v. Carrier , 477 U. S. 478 ( 1986 ) . See Coleman , supra , at 752–753 . Car - rier involved the failure of a defendant ’s attorney to raise a claim on direct appeal . 477 U. S. , at 482 . This failure did not constitute cause , we explained , because it was not an “ objective factor external to the defense . ” Id. , at 488 ( emphasis added ) . This external - factor requirement reflects the judgment that States should not be forced to undergo federal habeas review of a defaulted claim unless a factor not attributable to the prisoner obstructed his compliance with state procedures . See i d . , at 487–488 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Although this externality requirement has been the North Star of our excuse - for - cause jurisprudence , today ’s opinion does not whisper its name — no doubt because it is impossible to say that Martinez ’s procedural default was caused by a factor external to his defense . Coleman and Carrier set forth in clear terms when it is that attorney error constitutes an external factor : Attorney error by it - self does not , because when an attorney acts ( or fails to act ) in furtherance of the litigation , he is acting as the petitioner ’s agent . Coleman , supra , at 753 ; Carrier , supra , at 492 . Any other rule would be inconsistent with our system of representative litigation , under which “ each party is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer - agent . ” Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs , 498 U. S. 89 , 92 ( 1990 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . But when attorney error amounts to constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel , that error is imputed to the State ( for the State has failed to comply with the constitutional requirement to provide effective counsel ) , rendering the error external to the petitioner . Coleman , supra , at 754 ; Carrier , supra , at 488 . Accordingly , as Martinez himself appears to recognize , see Brief for Petitioner 22 , our cases require that absent a determination that Arizona violated the Constitution by failing to provide effective counsel , attorney error can not provide cause to excuse his procedural default . Rather than apply that rule here , the Court adopts the very approach Coleman explicitly addressed and rejected .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court essentially disclaims any need to give full consideration to the principle of stare decisis because Coleman did not involve an initial - review collateral proceeding for a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel . See ante , at 12 . That is rather like saying that Marbury v. Madison , 1 Cranch 137 ( 1803 ) , does not establish our authority to review the constitutionality of a new federal statute because it involved a different enactment . Just as the reasoning of Marbury was categorical , so was the reasoning of Coleman and Carrier : Attorney error is not an external factor constituting cause for excusing default unless the State has a constitutional obligation to provide effective counsel . Had the majority seriously considered the relevant stare decisis factors , see , e.g. , Montejo v. Louisiana , 556 U. S. 778–793 ( 2009 ) , it would have had difficulty justifying today ’s decision . Nor can it escape the demands of stare decisis by saying that our rules regarding the excuse of procedural default reflect an “ equitable judgment ” that is “ elaborated in the exercise of the Court ’s discretion . ” Ante , at 10 . Equity is not lawlessness , and discretion is not license to cast aside established jurisprudence reaffirmed this very Term . See Maples v. Thomas , 565 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2012 ) ( slip op . , at 12 ) ( “ Negligence on the part of a prisoner ’s postconviction attorney does not qualify as ‘ cause’ ” ( quoting Coleman , supra , at 753 ) ) . “ ‘ [ C]ourts of equity must be governed by rules and precedents no less than courts of law.’ ” Lonchar v. Thomas , 517 U. S. 314 , 323 ( 1996 ) ( quoting Missouriv . Jenkins , 515 U. S. 70 , 127 ( 1995 ) ( Thomas , J. , concurring ) ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Noticeably absent from the Court ’s equitable analysis , moreover , is any consideration of the very reason for a procedural - default rule : the comity and respect that fed - eral courts must accord state - court judgments . See Edwards v. Carpenter , 529 U. S. 446 , 451 ( 2000 ) . The procedural - default doctrine reflects the understanding that federal review of defaulted claims may “ circumvent the jurisdictional limits of direct review and ‘ undermine the State ’s interest in enforcing its laws.’ ” Lee v. Kemna , 534 U. S. 362 , 388 ( 2002 ) ( Kennedy , J. , dissenting ) ( quoting Coleman , supra , at 731 ) . Unlike today ’s decision , Carrier and Coleman took account of the significant costs federal habeas review imposes on States , including the “ reduction in the finality of litigation and the frustration of ‘ both the States’ sovereign power to punish offenders and their good - faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.’ ” Carrier , supra , at 487 ( quoting Engle v. Isaac , 456 U. S. 107 , 128 ( 1982 ) ) . Criminal conviction ought to be final before society has forgotten the crime that justifies it . When a case arrives at federal habeas , the state conviction and sentence at issue ( never mind the underlying crime ) are already a dim memory , on average more than 6 years old ( 7 years for capital cases ) . 5 I would adhere to the precedents that prevent a bad situation from becoming worse .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We granted certiorari on , and the parties addressed their arguments to , the following question :	@@empty@@	unmatched
“ Whether a defendant in a state criminal case who is prohibited by state law from raising on direct appeal any claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel , but who has a state - law right to raise such a claim in a first post - conviction proceeding , has a federal constitutional right to effective assistance of first post - conviction counsel specifically with respect to his ineffective - assistance - of - trial - counsel claim . ” Pet . for Cert . i.	@@empty@@	unmatched
While the Court ’s decision not to answer the question did not avoid the costs a constitutional holding would have imposed on States , it did avoid the Court ’s need to confront the established rule that there is no right to counsel in collateral proceedings . To avoid his procedural default , Martinez advocates in favor of an exception to this rule where the prisoner seeks the right to counsel in an initial - review collateral proceeding — an argument we have previously declined to address . See Coleman , 501 U. S. , at 755 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The argument is quite clearly foreclosed by our precedent . In Pennsylvania v. Finley , 481 U. S. 551 ( 1987 ) , and Murray v. Giarratano , 492 U. S. 1 ( 1989 ) , we stated un - equivocally that prisoners do not “ have a constitutional right to counsel when mounting collateral attacks upon their convictions . ” Finley , supra , at 555 . See also Giar - ratano , 492 U. S. , at 10 ( plurality opinion ) ( “ [ T]he ruleof Pennsylvania v. Finley should apply no differentlyin capital cases than in noncapital cases ” ) ; i d . , at 14 ( Kennedy , J. , concurring in judgment ) ( indicating that the Constitution does not categorically require States to provide counsel to death - row inmates seeking state habeas review ) . Though Finley may have involved only claims that could have been raised on direct review , see 481 U. S. , at 553 ; Giarratano , supra , at 24 ( Stevens , J. , dissenting ) , the Court was no doubt aware that States often limit “ the collateral review process [ to ] issues that have not previously been litigated or argued on the direct appeal . ” Brief for Respondent in Finley , O. T. 1986 , No . 85–2099 , p. 11 , n. 5 . And Giarratano , which involved a class action filed under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 , addressed the general assertion that the Constitution requires the appointment of counsel for collateral attacks on capital convictions . See 492 U. S. , at 3–4 ( plurality opinion ) . The Court rejected that assertion without qualification . The dissenting opinion , more - over , made the precise argument Martinez now asserts : under state law “ some claims [ including ineffective assistance of trial counsel ] ordinarily heard on direct review will be relegated to postconviction proceedings . ” Id. , at 24 ( Stevens , J. , dissenting ) . See also Brief for Respondents in Giarratano , O. T. 1988 , No . 88–411 , p. 29 , n. 8 ( “ In [ Virginia capital habeas ] proceedings , Death Row inmates seek to assert claims that have not been , and could not have been addressed on direct appeal . . . ” ) . Thus , in announcing a categorical rule in Finley , see Giarratano , supra , at 12 ( plurality opinion ) , and then reaffirming it in Giarratano , the Court knew full well that a collateral proceeding may present the first opportunity for a prisoner to raise a constitutional claim . I would follow that rule in this case and reject Martinez ’s argument that there is a constitutional right to counsel in initial - review collateral proceedings .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Far from avoiding the consequences a constitutional holding would have imposed on the States , today ’s holding as a practical matter requires States to appoint counsel in initial - review collateral proceedings — and , to boot , eliminates the pre - existing assurance of escaping federal - habeas review for claims that appointed counsel fails to present . Despite the Court ’s protestations to the contrary , the decision is a radical alteration of our habeas jurisprudence that will impose considerable economic costs on the States and further impair their ability to provide justice in a timely fashion . The balance it strikes between the finality of criminal judgments and the need to provide for review of defaulted claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel grossly underestimates both the frequency of such claims in federal habeas , and the incentives to argue ( since it is a free pass to federal habeas ) that appointed counsel was ineffective in failing to raise such claims . The balance might have been close ( though it would disregard our established jurisprudence ) if the Court merely held that uncounseled failure to raise ineffective assistance of trial counsel would not constitute default . But in adding to that the rule that counseled failure to raise it may also provide an excuse , the Court creates a monstrosity . For these reasons , I respectfully dissent .	@@empty@@	unmatched

At the date of the passage of these acts the rapid growth of the country , and the steady increase of its litigation , had so congested the docket of this court that years frequently elapsed before appeals and writs of error could be heard . When , then , the interstate commerce commission was created , and provision made for the enforcement of its orders by the circuit courts , while appeals were allowed from the decrees of those courts to this court , it was the legislative will that such appeals should not suspend the operation of the decrees appealed from . It is quite true that if the circuit court reversed the order of the commission , and dismissed the petition , the question of superseding such a decree might not be material ; but , as the section provided that either party might appeal , the inhibition on the effect of the appeal applied alike to either .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Accordingly all cases in which the judgments and decrees of the circuit courts of appeals were made final by the act can only be brought to this court on certiorari , although in other cases , of which this is one , appeal or error will lie . The act also provided that when a case reaches this court through the circuit court of appeals , by appeal , writ of error , or certiorari , the cause shall be remanded to the proper district or circuit court for further proceedings in pursuance of the determination of this court , exactly as if the case came here directly from the district or circuit court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Assuming that section 16 of the interstate commerce act remained unrepealed , it was nevertheless so far affected as that the appa l from the trial court had to be prosecuted to the circuit court of appeals , instead of to this court .

But such appeal would not operate to supersede the decree of the trial court , nor would such decree be superseded if the case were brought to this court from the circuit court of appeals , even though the judgment of the latter court were superseded .

The court of appeals reversed that decree , but it still remained in force , because the judgment of the circuit court of appeals had been superseded .

And it is argued that the words , ' all provisions for bonds or other securities , ' which were in force at the time of the adoption of the act of 1891 , include , as applicable to appeals from the circuit courts of appeals , the provision of section 16 of the interstate commerce act , that the appeal therein referred to shall not operate to stay or supersede . We can not accede to that view , for the appeal treated of in section 16 is an appeal from the trial court , and does not refer to an appeal from the circuit courts of appeals . ' Either party to such proceeding before said court may appeal , ' is the language ; and , as ' said court ' confessedly referred to the circuit court , the only question would be whether the scope of the provision had been enlarged by the act of 1891 , in the matter under consideration , which we do not think it had .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Petitioner was tried and convicted for the unlawful sale , dispensing , and possession of narcotics , and her conviction was affirmed , 21 Ill.2d 63 , 171 N.E.2d 17 . She seeks certiorari to review the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court , on the ground that incriminating statements drawn from her by threats and promises were used against her at trial in contravention of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . 28 U.S.C. 1257 , 28 U.S.C.A. § 1257 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Rule 23 , sudb . 1(f ) of this Court , 28 U.S.C.A. , requires that a petitioner , seeking review of a state court decision shall ' specify the stage in the proceedings in the court o first instance and in the appellate court , at which , and the manner in which , the federal questions sought to be reviewed were raised * * * . ' There is no such specification in the present petition ; it is merely asserted that the Supreme Court of Illinois ' overlooked the fact ' that involuntary admissions are not competent evidence .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Respondent argues that certiorari should be denied for failure to comply with this Rule . Discovering that petitioner had invoked the Due Process Clause in her brief before the Illinois Supreme Court , this Court requested a response to this from Illinois . Respondent now urges that the Due Process Clause was not cited until appeal , that the Illinois Supreme Court does not determine constitutional questions unless they have been specifically raised at trial , and that the judgment was accordingly based on an adequate and independent ground of state law .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The opinion of the Illinois Court does not mention the claim of involuntary admissions . It expressly rejects a claim that petitioner was surprised by their introduction without proper statutory notice , and concludes with an omniumgatherum clause , ' We have examined numerous other allegations of error and find that they are of insufficient merit of justify further discussion . Suffice it to say that , on the entire record , the defendant received a fair trial and was proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt . ' A petition for rehearing , assigning the admission of the statements as error and citing Brown v. State of Mississippi , 297 U.S. 278 , 56 S.Ct . 461 , 80 L.Ed.2d 682 , was denied without opinion . An abstract of the trial court record indicates that the admissions were objected to a trial but does not show whether the Due Process Clause was invoked . This Court today defers consideration of the petition pending clarification by the Illinois Court whether its disposition of the due process issue was based on its merits or on an independent state ground .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The constitutional basis for this Court 's review of state Court judgments derives from the Supremacy Clause of Article VI , statutorily enforced by the famous Sec . 25 of the First Judiciary Act , 1 Stat . 73 , 85 ( 1789 ) , now 28 U.S.C. 1257 , 28 U.S.C.A. § 1257 . Accordingly , if a state judgment rests on an adequate , independent ground of state law , this Court is without power to review the judgment , since its decision of the federal issue could not affect the result . Murdock v. City of Memphis , 20 Wall . 590 , 632 , 634 - 635 , 22 L.Ed . 429 ; Herb v. Pitcairn , 324 U.S. 117 , 125 - 126 , 65 S.Ct . 459 , 463 , 89 L.Ed . 789 . Since Judicial opinions are not mathematically formulated and the dubieties of language are what they are , a particular opinion of a state court sometimes raises a solid doubt whether a judgment does rest on an adequate , independent state ground and whether the disposition of a federal claim was not necessary to the challenged judgment . Lest a federal right properly reviewable here be lost through such ambiguity , this Court has utilized the procedure of holding a case here until opportunity has been afforded for an appropriate certificate by the State court for clarification of the ambiguity , i. e. , to make unambiguously clear that its judgment has not adjudicated a federal claim but rests on an independent state ground . See Herb v. Pitcairn , supra , 324 U.S. at 128 , 65 S.Ct . at 464 ; Loftus v. People of State of Illinois , 334 U.S. 804 , 68 S.Ct . 1212 . Instead of awaiting this Court 's initiation of such a procedure , in some jurisdictions counsel on their own initiative secure a certificate from their state tribunal in order to leave no doubt before the case is brought here that it does turn on a claim of a federal right . See Herb v. Pitcairn , supra , 324 U.S. at 127 , 65 S.Ct . at 464 ; Honeyman v. Hanan , 300 U.S. 14 , 18 , 57 S.Ct . 350 , 352 , 81 L.Ed . 476 ; Whitney v.

In either case , however , such a procedure for clarification does not come into play when the state court opinion in the case sought to be reviewed does not mention the federal ground , when counsel make no assertion that the judgment was based on a determination of the federal issue , and when state law affords an adequate ground for the disposition below . On full canvass of our jurisdiction in this class of cases , the Court not so long ago made this authoritative pronouncement :	@@empty@@	unmatched

Thus , when the state court writes no opinion and from the record it can not be said that its judgment was not based on an adequate non - federal ground , this Court will not take jurisdiction .

It is not our businessindeed in interferes with the deffective use of our time for the conduct of our businessto be excavating records in order to find out whether a federal question somehow or other lurks in a record although counsel , as required by our own Rule , has not called our attention to the place in the record where it is unequivocally set forth . In these circumstances , I see no reason for asking the Supreme Court of Illinois to clarify something that does not call for clarification .

Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The question in this case is whether a special police officer who in his official capacity subjects a person suspected of crime to force and violence in order to obtain a confession may be prosecuted under § 20 of the Criminal Code , 18 U.S.C. ( 1946 ed . ) § 52 , now 18 U.S.C.A. § 242 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Section 20 provides in pertinent part : ' Whoever , under color of any law , statute , ordinance , regulation , or custom , willfully subjects , or causes to be subjected , any inhabitant of any State , Territory , or District to the deprivation of any rights , privileges , or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States * * * shall be fined not more than $ 1,000 , or imprisoned not more than one year , or both .

The facts are these : The Lindsley Lumber Co. suffered numerous thefts and hired petitioner , who operated a detective agency , to ascertain the identity of the thieves . Petitioner held a special police officer 's card issued by the City of Miami , Florida , and had taken an oath and qualified as a special police officer . Petitioner and others over a period of three days took four men to a paint shack on the company 's premises and used brutal methods to obtain a confession from each of them . A rubber hose , a pistol , a blunt instrument , a sash cord and other implements were used in the project . One man was forced to look at a bright light for fifteen minutes ; when he was blinded , he was repeatedly hit with a rubber hose and a sash cord and finally knocked to the floor . Another was knocked from a chair and hit in the stomach again and again . He was put back in the chair and the procedure was repeated . One was backed against the wall and jammed in the chest with a club . Each was beaten , threatened , and unmercifully punished for several hours until he confessed . One Ford , a policeman , was sent by his superior to lend authority to the proceedings . And petitioner , who committed the assaults , went about flashing his badge .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The indictment charged among other things that petitioner acting under color of law used force to make each victim confess to his guilt and implicate others , and that the victims were denied the right to be tried by due process of law and if found guilty to be sentenced and punished in accordance with the laws of the state . Petitioner was found guilty by a jury under instructions which conformed with the rulings of the Court in Screws v. United States , 325 U.S. 91 , 65 S.Ct . 1031 , 89 L.Ed . 1495 . The Court of Appeals affirmed . 179 F.2d 656 . The case , which is a companion to No . 26 , United States v. Williams , 341 U.S. 70 , 71 S.Ct . 581 , and No . 134 , United States v. Williams , 341 U.S. 58 , 71 S.Ct . 595 , decided this day , is here on certiorari .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We think it clear that petitioner was acting ' under color ' of law within the meaning of § 20 , or at least that the jury could properly so find . We interpreted this phrase of § 20 in United States v. Classic , 313 U.S. 299 , 326 , 61 S.Ct . 1031 , 1043 , 85 L.Ed . 1368 . ' Misuse of power , possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law , is action taken ' under color of ' state law . ' And see Screws v. United States , supra , 325 U.S. at pages 107111 , 65 S.Ct . at pages 10381040 , 89 L.Ed . 1495 . It is common practice , as we noted in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Co. , 331 U.S. 416 , 429 , 67 S.Ct . 1274 , 1281 , 91 L.Ed . 1575 , for private guards or detectives to be vested with policemen 's powers . We know from the record that that is the policy of Miami , Florida . Moreover , this was an investigation conducted under the aegis of the State , as evidenced by the fact that a regular police officer was detailed to attend it . We need go no further to conclude that the lower court , to whom we give deference on local law matters , see Gardner v. State of New Jersey , 329 U.S. 565 , 583 , 67 S.Ct . 467 , 476 , 91 L.Ed . 504 , was correct in holding that petitioner was no mere interloper but had a semblance of policeman 's power from Florida . There was , therefore , evidence that he acted under authority of Florida law ; and the manner of his conduct of the interrogations makes clear that he was asserting the authority granted him and not acting in the role of a private person . In any event the charge to the jury drew the line between official and unofficial conduct which we explored in Screws v. United States , supra , 325 U.S. at page 111 , 65 S.Ct . at page 1040 , 89 L.Ed . 1495 , and gave petitioner all of the protection which ' color of ' law as used in § 20 offers .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The main contention is that the application of § 20 so as to sustain a conviction for obtaining a confession by use of force and violence is unconstitutional . The argument is the one that a clear majority of the Court rejected in Screws v. United States , and runs as follows :	@@empty@@	unmatched
Criminal statutes must have an ascertainable standard of guilt or they fall for vagueness . See United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co. , 255 U.S. 81 , 41 S.Ct . 298 , 65 L.Ed . 516 ; Winters v. People of State of New York , 333 U.S. 507 , 68 S.Ct . 665 , 92 L.Ed . 840 . Section 20 , it is argued , lacks the necessary specificity when rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment are involved . We are pointed to the course of decisions by this Court under the Due Process Clause as proof of the vague and fluid standard for ' rights , privileges , or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution ' as used in § 20 . We are referred to decisions where we have been closely divided on whether state action violated due process . More specifically we are cited many instances where the Court has been conspicuously in disagreement on the illegal character of confessions under the Due Process Clause . If the Court can not agree as to what confessions violate the Fourteenth Amendment , how can one who risks criminal prosecutions for his acts be sure of the standard ? Thus it is sought to show that police officers such as petitioner walk on ground far too treacherous for criminal responsibility .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Many criminal statutes might be extended to circumstances so extreme as to make their application unconstitutional . Conversely , as we held in Screws v. United States , a close construction will often save an act from vagueness that is fatal . The present case is as good an illustration as any . It is as plain as a pikestaff that the present confessions would not be allowed in evidence whatever the school of thought concerning the scope and meaning of the Due Process Clause . This is the classic use of force to make a man testify against himself . The result is as plain as if the rack , the wheel , and the thumb screwthe ancient methods of securing evidence by torture , Brown v. State of Mississippi , 297 U.S. 278 , 285286 , 56 S.Ct . 461 , 464465 , 80 L.Ed . 682 ; Chambers v. State of Florida , 309 U.S. 227 , 237 , 60 S.Ct . 472 , 477 , 84 L.Ed . 716were used to compel the confession . Some day the application of § 20 to less obvious methods of coercion may be presented and doubts as to the adequacy of the standard of guilt may be presented . There may be a similar doubt when an officer is tried under § 20 for beating a man to death . That was a doubt stirred in the Screws case ; and it was the reason we held that the purpose must be plain , the deprivation of the constitutional right willful . But where police take matters in their own hands , seize victims , beat and pound them until they confess , there can not be the slightest doubt that the police have deprived the victim of a right under the Constitution . It is the right of the accused to be tried by a legally constituted court , not by a kangaroo court . Hence when officers wring confessions from the accused by force and violence , they violate some of the most fundamental , basic , and well - established constitutional rights which every citizen enjoys . Petitioner and his associates acted willfully and purposely ; their aim was precisely to deny the protection that the Constitution affords . 1 It was an arrogant and brutal deprivation of rights which the Constitution specifically guarantees . Section 20 would be denied the high service for which it was designed if rights so palpably plain were denied its protection . Only casuistry could make vague and nebulous what our constitutional scheme makes so clear and specific .	@@empty@@	unmatched
An effort , however , is made to free Williams by an extremely technical construction of the indictment and charge , so as to condemn the application of § 20 on the grounds of vagueness .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The indictment charged that petitioners deprived designated persons of rights and privileges secured to them by the Fourteenth Amendment . These deprivations were defined in the indictment to include ' illegal ' assault and battery . But the meaning of these rights in the context of the indictment was plain , viz . immunity from the use of force and violence to obtain a confession . Thus count 2 of the indictment charges that the Fourteenth Amendment rights of one Purnell were violated in the following respects : ' * * * the right and privilege not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law , the right and privilege to be secure in his person while in the custody of the State of Florida , the right and privilege not to be subjected to punishment without due process of law , the right and privilege to be immune , while in the custody of persons acting under color of the laws of the State of Florida , from illegal assault and battery by any person exercising the authority of said State , and the right and privilege to be tried by due process of law and if found guilty to be sentenced and punished in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida ; that is to say , on or about the 28th day of March , 1947 , the defendants arrested and detained and caused to be arrested and detained the said Frank J. Purnell , Jr. , and brought and caused him to be brought to and into a certain building sometimes called a shack on the premises of the Lindsley Lumber Co. , at or near 3810 N.W. 17th Avenue , in said City of Miami , Florida , and did there detain the said Frank J. Purnell , Jr. , and while he was so detained the defendants did then and there illegally strike , bruise , batter , beat , assault and torture the said Frank J. Purnell , Jr. , in order illegally to coerce and force the said Frank J. Purnell , Jr. , to make an admission and confession of his guilt in connection with the alleged theft of personal property , alleged to be the property of said Lindsley Lumber Co. , and in order illegally to coerce and force the said Frank J. Purnell , Jr. , to name and accuse other persons as participants in alleged thefts of personal property , alleged to be the property of the said Lindsley Lumber Co. , and for the purpose of imposing illegal summary punishment upon the said Frank J. Purnell , Jr. '	@@empty@@	unmatched
The trial judge in his charge to the jury summarized Count 2 as meaning that the defendants beat Purnell ' for the purpose of forcing him to make a confession and for the purpose of imposing illegal summary punishment upon him . ' He further made clear that the defendants were ' not here on trial for a violation of any law of the State of Florida for assault ' nor ' for assault under any laws of the United States . ' There can not be the slightest doubt from the reading of the indictment and charge as a whole that the defendants were charged with and tried for one of the most brutal deprivations of constitutional rights that can be imagined . It therefore strains at technicalities to say that any issue of vagueness of § 20 as construed and applied is present in the case . Our concern is to see that substantial justice is done , not to search the record for possible errors which will defeat the great purpose of Congress in enacting § 20 .	@@empty@@	unmatched

This proceeding was commenced by the state of Texas against the defendant , the Houston & Texas Central Railroad Company ( hereafter called the company ) , to recover the amount due on certain bonds issued to the state , and to foreclose the lien which existed upon its property as security for the payment of such bonds . The company is the legal successor of the two companies which received the loans and gave their bonds , and no question of liability arises on that ground . Judgment was given in the trial court for the amount found due , and a lien was declared and a sale of the property of the company ordered . From this judgment the company appealed to the court of civil appeals for the state , where it was modified , and then affirmed . The company brings the case here on writ of error .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The petition of the state by which the proceeding was commenced showed that the predecessors of the plaintiff in error borrowed money from the school fund of the state , and gave their bonds therefor . These bonds were not paid according to their tenor and effect , and the legislature therefore , on August 13 , 1870 , passed a general act for the relief of railroad companies indebted to the state , by which it was provided that if any company should on the 1st day of November , 1870 , pay six months ' interest on the aggregate amount of the loan which , on the 1st day of May , 1870 , was due from it to the state , and 1 per centum of the principal , and thereafter should make similar semiannual payments , the state would not exact any other payments .	@@empty@@	unmatched
( What was the aggregate amount of the loans due on the 1st of May , 1870 , from the two companies of which the present company is the successor , is the question in controversy , and its answer depends upon the validity of certain payments made by the companies to the state in treasury warrants during the war . Part of the discussion rests upon the meaning and effect of this act , and it is therefore given in full in the margin . ) Subsequently , semiannual payments of interest and sinking fund were made by or on account of the Washington County Railroad Company ( one of the predecessors of the plaintiff in error ) , up to and including the 1st of May , 1879 , but no payment was made on November 1 , 1879 , or at any time thereafter . Similar payments were made by or on account of the Houston & Texas Central Railway Company ( the other of such predecessors ) up to and including the 1st day of May , 1893 , but a portion only of the semiannual interest claimed to be due in November , 1893 , was paid , and nothing has been paid since November 1 , 1893 . Judgment was prayed for the sums of money stated to be due , with interest , for the foreclosure of the lien , and for a sale of the property under execution , the proceeds to be applied to the payment of the sum due with interest , and for such other relief as might be necessary .	@@empty@@	unmatched
To this petition the defendant filed an answer , and therein , among other things , alleged that after the commencement of the civil war the various railroad companies were unable to fulfil their obligations to the state , and therefore the legislature of Texas , on the 11th day of January , 1862 , passed an act for their relief , extending the time of payment of interest and sinking fund amounts until the 1st of January , 1864 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The state legislature , on December 16 , 1863 , passed the first act in relation to receiving treasury warrants from railroad companies , which reads as follows :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' Sec . 1 . Be it enacted by the legislature of the state of Texas , that the comptroller of the state be , and he is hereby , authorized to receive from the railroad companies in this state who are indebted to the special school fund , all interest on their bonds that may now be or hereafter become due , provided the same is tendered in state bonds or in state treasury warrants , previous to the meeting of the next regular session of the state legislature .	@@empty@@	unmatched

' Sec . 1 .

' Sec . 2 .

'	@@empty@@	unmatched
On November 16 , 1864 , still another act was passed by the legislature which reads as follows :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' Be it enacted by the legislature of the state of Texas , that the railroad companies of this state that are indebted to the special school fund shall continue to be allowed the privilege of paying the interest due said fund in the treasury warrants and bonds and coupons of the state , and may also discharge the whole or any part of the principal of their indebtedness to that fund ( in the same manner ) , provided such railroad companies shall satisfy the comptroller that the treasury warrants and bonds and coupons of the state are received by them at par with specie for freight and passenger travel .	@@empty@@	unmatched
' That all treasury warrants and bonds and coupons of the state , so received into the state treasury , shall be canceled ; and the comptroller shall issue the bonds of the state , bearing 6 per cent interest , to the special school fund for the amount so paid in ; and this act take effect from its passage . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
Upon the passage of these various acts and in reliance upon the agreement and obligation of the state , as evidenced thereby , the two companies acquired treasury warrants upon good consideration , and after the passage of the act of May , 1864 , they received treasury warrants at par in payment of freight and passenger services rendered by them to the various people who demanded the same , and they subsequently paid treasury warrants to the comptroller of the state in payment of interest due on their indebtedness ( the amounts of such payments are set forth in the answer ) ; and upon such payment and receipt of the warrants by the comptroller and treasurer they were canceled as authorized and required by the abovementioned act ; and thereupon the comptroller and treasurer issued the bonds of the state bearing 6 per centum interest to the special school fund for the amount so paid by the railroad companies in treasury warrants . By reason of all which it was alleged that a valid and binding contract between the state and the railroad companies was made , that the payments in treasury warrants should be valid payments , at their par value , upon the various loans made by the state to the companies ; and it was further alleged that the payments by treasury warrants had been received by the authorities of the state and canceled , and a credit for the amount thereof as payment given to the companies on the books of the state , and that the transaction thereby became fully executed , and the state could not thereafter dispute or question the validity of such payments or the right of the company to the credits given it by the state .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is also alleged that after the passage of the act of August 13 , 1870 , and about the 1st of November , 1870 , the comptroller of the state , with the concurrence and approval of the governor , wrongfully and without authority of law , recharged each of the railroad companies respectively upon the books of the comptroller 's office with the several amounts theretofore paid by them respectively in treasury warrants , and there was demanded from the respective companies on the 1st day of November , 1870 , six months ' interest and 1 per cent for the sinking fund on the aggregate amount of the loan , as made up by the comptroller , after striking out the payments made by the company with the treasury warrants . These amounts were paid under protest , as being illegally demanded and resulting in a violation of the contract existing between the companies and the state . Payments on the same basis were continued semiannually from that time , accompanied by a protest similar to the one first mentioned , until , as the company contends , the full amount due by it to the state had been paid , provided the payments in treasury warrants were credited as valid payments . Since that time the company has refused to make further payments . It claimed that the act of August 13 , 1870 , as construed by the state authorities , impaired the obligation of the contract existing between the state and itself , and thereupon it prayed for judgment .	@@empty@@	unmatched
To this pleading the plaintiff filed its first supplemental petition , and therein specially set up that the three several acts of the legislature of the state , mentioned in the defendant 's answer as the authority for the payment upon the bonds of the company in treasury warrants , were unconstitutional and void , because ( 1 ) the warrants in which paym payments were authorized to be were issued for the purpose of being circulated as money and were in violation of the state Constitution ; ( 2 ) also because they were bills of credit emitted by the state , and therefore in violation of section 10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States ; and ( 3 ) because the acts under which the warrants were authorized to be paid , together with other acts passed at or about the same time , plainly indicated that the treasury warrants and other obligations in which payments were authorized to be made , and which were made by the defendant , were issued in aid of the Rebellion against the United States of America , and were therefore void .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Upon these pleadings a motion was made by the company to remove the case to the United States circuit court , on the ground that by the filing of the plaintiff 's last abovementioned pleading it became apparent for the first time , from plaintiff 's statement of its own claim , that the case was one arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States , and defendant was therefore entitled to a removal . The motion was denied , and although further pleadings were thereafter served on each side they are not material to the matters discussed in the opinion .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The case was tried without a jury , there being no dispute as to the facts . The trial court held that the payments in treasury warrants were illegal because they were issued to circulate as money , in violation of the Constitution of the state . It also held that they were issued , or at least some of them were issued , in direct aid of the Rebellion , and were therefore void ; that the burden rested with the defendant to show , if it could , which , if any , of the warrants were valid . Judgment was given in favor of the state .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The company then appealed to the court of civil appeals for the third supreme judicial district of the state , where the judgment was modified so as to render no personal judgment against the company , and to foreclose the lien of the state only upon that part of the road which the findings showed was in existence on August 13 , 1870 , and as thus modified it was affirmed , solely on the ground that the warrants were issued in violation of the state Constitution , as paper intended to circulate as money . A writ of error was applied for to the supreme court of Texas , and by that court refused . The company then brought the case here by writ of error to the court of civil appeals . The defendant in error has made a motion to dismiss the writ on the ground that this court has no jurisdiction , for reasons stated in the opinion .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Mr. Justice Peckham , after stating the foregoing facts , delivered the opinion of the court :	@@empty@@	unmatched
The motion to dismiss the writ of error must be denied . The case involves a Federal question under the contract clause of the Constitution .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The claim on the part of the defendant in error , the plaintiff below , is that the state court decided the case under the provisions of the state Constitution only , and without reference to the act of 1870 , which the plaintiff in error ( the railroad company ) alleges to be an impairment of the contract set up by it in the pleadings . Although the state court held that the payments in dispute were made by means of state treasury warrants issued to circulate as money , which were therefore void as in violation of the Constitution of the state , and that the delivery of the warrants by the company amounted to no payment whatever , the question still remains whether by that decision any effect was given to the act of 1870 . We think the judgment of the state court did give effect to that act .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It will be seen that the 3d section provides that the state will not exact of any railroad company not thereafter in default , the payment of the principal of the debt , excepting as paid by the payments due the sinking fund under the provisions of the act ; it also provides in the 2d section that if a railroad company failed to pay the amount required to be paid in section 1 , at the times designated thereby or within ten days thereafter , then the whole debt of such company , principal and interest , should become due , and the governor was directed to proceed as therein stated .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The first thing to be done in order to be able to carry out the provisions of the act was to ascertain what the aggregate amount of the loan was , as that amount stood on the 1st day of May , 1870 , because it was upon that amount that interest semiannually was to be paid , and also 1 per cent of principal to the sinking fund . The authorities of the state determined what the aggregate amount was as it stood on the 1st day of May , 1870 , and they arrived at that amount by refusing to recognize as valid any payment which the company had made in treasury warrants , and in that way they made the aggregate amount larger by those sums than that made by the company , which claimed to be credited with the amount of its payments in those warrants . Upon the aggregate amount as determined by the authorities of the state , payment of the interest and for the sinking fund was demanded under the act . This demand was complied with by the company under protest , and accompanied by a claim on its part that the aggregate amount due on the loan was less than that stated by the authorities of the state by just the amount of the payments which the company had made in these treasury warrants . The protest was overruled and the claim denied , and thereafter the same protest and the same claim were made and the same action taken upon the part of the state authorities on each semiannual occasion when payments were due and made . This lasted until the payments made by the company in cash and in the treasury warrants , upon the basis of the legality of the payments in such warrants , paid the indebtedness due from the company to the state , and from that time it has refused to make further payments . The state did not acknowledge that full payment had been made of that indebtedness , and thereupon commenced the present proceeding to recover the amount it claimed to be due , and to foreclose its lien against the company . This it could not do under the statute of 1870 unless the company had defaulted in respect to the payments required under that act .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is admitted that the company had not so defaulted , provided the payments in treasury warrants were duly credited to it ; nor is it denied , on the other hand , that if those payments were not valid payments and ought not to be credited to the company , then it had defaulted in respect to the payments required by the act before the commencement of these proceedings . When the state court , therefore , decided that these warrants were issued in violation of the Constitution of the state , and that payments in them were in fact and in law no payments , and gave judgment accordingly , the effect of that decision was necessarily to hold that the company had defaulted in respect to the payments required under the act , and that the proceedings of the state to collect the sum due were permitted by the act , and effect was thus given to such act , although not one word was spoken in regard to it in the opinion delivered in the state court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
If the railroad company had not failed to pay any amount required to be paid in section 1 of the act , then the proceeding herein could not have been taken , by reason of the provision contained in the 3d section , and it is only after a failure to pay for ten days that the 2d section permits the proceedings to be taken to collect the amount . In giving judgment for the plaintiff , therefore , the court has in effect determined that the plaintiff was proceeding rightly under the act of 1870 , and effect was thus given to its provisions .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The judgment of the court of civil appeals gives an additional effect to the act , because by its judgment there is struck out the provision in the judgment of the trial court in regard to the lien of the state , and it has limited that lien in accordance with the 3d section of the act , so that it should not attach to any extension of the railroad which had been constructed since its passage . Although that modification may be a favor to the company , it nevertheless gives effect to the act . The company has not accepted that act so that it can not draw in question its validity as construed by the state court , and hence no reason is shown for the granting of the motion to dismiss on that ground . The only acceptance consists in the payments made by the company to the state after its passage . The very first payment made by the company , under the act , namely , on the 1st day of November , 1870 , was , however , made while asserting the claim that payments in treasury warrants were valid and should be acknowledged and credited to the company ; and upon the refusal of the state authorities to admit those payments the company paid the interest and percentage on the larger sum demanded by the state , under protest that such demand was illegal and improper , and every subsequent payment was made under the same protest by the company . Payments so made show no such acceptance of the act as to prevent the company from thereafter drawing in question its validity as construed by the state authorities .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Thus we see that , although the decision of the state court was based upon the ground that the warrants in which these payments were made had been issued in utter violation of the state Constitution , and were hence void , and that no payments made with such warrants had any validity , and although this ground of invalidity was arrived at without any reference made to the act of 1870 , yet the necessary consequence of the judgment was that effect was thereby given to that act , and in a manner which the company has always claimed to be illegal and unwarranted by the act when properly construed . The company has never accepted such a construction , but on the contrary has always opposed it , and raises the question in this proceeding at the very outset . Upon these facts this court has jurisdiction , and it is its duty to determine for itself the existence , construction , and validity of the alleged contract , and also to determine whether , as construed by this court , it has been impaired by any subsequent state legislation to which effect has been given by the court below .

The motion for the removal of this case to the United States circuit court was properly denied . The statement of the cause of action as contained in plaintiff 's first petition did not show that the suit was one arising under the Constitution , laws , or treaties of the United States .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The suit , as it appears upon the face of the petition of plaintiff , was upon the bonds given by the company for the loan of a portion of the school fund , and to foreclose the lien of the state upon the property of the company , and in the petition reference was made to the act of 1870 for the purpose of stating the amount due on the bonds for principal and interest . Nothing upon the face of this petition showed any fact upon which Federal jurisdiction could be based . The company answered by alleging certain payments in treasury warrants , which , if properly credited , would show that , with the other payments that had been made , there was nothing due the plaintiff on the bonds . As an answer to this defense the plaintiff set up the invalidity of the laws providing for payments in treasury warrants ; that the warrants were issued by the state in violation of both the state and Federal Constitutions , and that the payments were therefore illegal and void . This was no part of the plaintiff 's cause of action upon which suit was brought , and that cause of action did not in any way involve a question arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States . The defendant therefore made out no case for a removal to the United States circuit court . Oregon Short Line & U. N. R. Co. v. Skottowe , 162 U. S. 490 , 494 , 40 L. ed . 1048 , 1049 , 16 Sup . Ct .

The result of the authorities is that the Federal character of the suit must appear in the plaintiff 's own statement of his claim , and that where a defense has been interposed , the reply to which brings out matters of a Federal nature , those matters thus brought out by the plaintiff do not form a part of his cause of action , but are merely a reply to the defense set up by the defendant . The review of the Federal question by this court is not thereby precluded , for , it having been properly raised in the state court and decided against the contention of the party setting it up , this court may review it on error to the highest court of the state .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This brings us to the question , What , if any , contract existed between the state and the company consequent upon the payments by the company to the comptroller of the state in the treasury warrants heretofore mentioned ? The company contends that by the passage of the acts of December 16 , 1863 , May 28 , 1864 , and November 16 , 1864 , and by its compliance with such acts , and its payment of treasury warrants to the comptroller , and their receipt by him , and his cancelation thereof , there was an executed transaction , and an implied contract thereupon arose that such payments should remain and be regarded as valid and effectual , and that this implied contract was entitled to the protection of the Constitution of the United States , and its obligation could not be impaired by any subsequent act of the legislature of the state .	@@empty@@	unmatched
These acts have been already set forth . The company alleges that it fully complied with all of them , and that , relying upon the offers thus made , it paid to the State the warrants mentioned , which were received by the comptroller and canceled , and bonds of the state for a like amount , bearing 6 per cent interest , were issued by him to the school fund .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The provision in the state Constitution , which it is alleged was violated by the issuing of these warrants , is contained in the 8th section of article 7 of the Constitution of 1845 , in which among other things , it was provided , ' . . . and in no case shall the legislature have the power to issue ' treasury warrants , ' ' treasury notes , ' or paper of any description intended to circulate as money .

It is stated in the opinion delivered in the court of civil appeals , ' that the warrants of the state issued during the period of the war after January 1 , 1862 , were intended to be used and circulated as money . And in this connection it is well to say that we are of the opinion , from all that is shown by the record , together with various acts of the legislatures during that time , that the payments made in warrants by the railway companies upon the obligations sued upon were in warrants issued after the time we have declared they were intended to circulate as money . ' The question whether the legislature so intended is one to be decided by an inspection of the act under which they were issued , and possibly by reference to the text of other acts of the legislature enacted at or about the same time . Whether an act provides for the issuing of warrants that were intended to circulate as money is in reality a question of law arising upon the construction of the legislative act ; and a finding by the court that warrants issued under and by virtue of certain acts of the legislature were issued with such intention is in the nature of a legal conclusion , and not a finding of fact , and therefore it can be reviewed by this court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
To prove that these warrants were so issued , reference is made to various acts of the legislature ( in addition to those above mentioned under which the payments were made by the company ) , among which are the following :	@@empty@@	unmatched
The act approved February 14 , 1860 , provided that when an account was presented for payment for which an appropriation had been made it was the duty of the comptroller to audit it if legal , and to issue his warrant for the amount , and if there were any money in the treasury to pay the demand the comptroller was directed to issue his warrant upon the treasurer for the amount , with 10 per cent per annum interest , and those warrants were to be signed by the governor and indorsed by the treasurer . The act further provided that these warrants should not circulate as money , but might be assigned .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is said that the warrants issued under this act were few , and they are not classed among the warrants in which any payments were made to the school fund . It is , of course , not contended that these warrants were intended to circulate as money , but the act was repealed in 1862 , and the repealing act , while containing other provisions , omitted the provision that the warrants to be issued should not circulate as money , and that omission is regarded by counsel as suggestive of the intention of the legislature that the warrants issued under the act of 1862 should so circulate .	@@empty@@	unmatched
By the 2d section of that act it was provided that the comptroller on presentation of any warrant bearing interest , as well as on presentation of any other legal claim for which an appropriation had been made , should draw a warrant on the treasury for the amount , and payment was to be made if there were any money in the treasury ; but if not , the comptroller was authorized to issue one or more warrants for the amount that might be due and payable to the party entitled to payment , or bearer , ' and said warrants shall be of such proportions of the claim as may be expressly required by the holder ; provided , that not more than one tenth of the whole amount may be issued in warrants of $ 1 each and the balance of $ 5 or more each , and said warrants shall be indorsed by the treasurer , and every interest - bearing warrant that is superseded shall be canceled by the comptroller . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
The 3d section of the act provided that when the warrants were presented at the treasury and paid they should be canceled , and should not be reissued .	@@empty@@	unmatched
By the act of January 11 , 1862 , it was provided that treasury warrants not bearing interest , in addition to the other provisions made for their reception in payment for lands ( including certificates therefor ) , should be receivable as money in the payment of office fees , including fees for patents and land dues payable in the general land office , taxes , and all other dues to be collected for the state or in its name , with exceptions therein stated .	@@empty@@	unmatched
By another act passed on the same day , January 11 , 1862 ( General Laws , Texas , 1862 , page 38 ) , the treasurer and every other officer of the state and of counties , who had received as public money , among other things , the treasury warrants of the state , were directed to disburse or transfer the same as money , at par , if the person or persons entitled to have a disbursement or transfer would receive such warrants as money ; and officers who were authorized to receive public money were authorized and directed to receive these warrants as money , except when expressly prohibited by some other law . Treasury warrants of the state received by the treasurer thereof were not to be reissued .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Also on December 16 , 1863 , another act was passed , section 2 of which reads as follows :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' A tax of 1/2 of 1 per cent shall be levied and collected in kind on all specie , treasury notes of the Confederate States of America , treasury warrants of the state of Texas , and bank notes held or owned in this state , and all foreign bills of exchange and certificates of deposit , and other evidences of money upon deposit or secured beyond the limits of the state , owned by persons residing therein , shall be known as specie , and thereon shall be levied a tax of 1/2 of 1 per cent in specie . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
The court below has construed these various acts , in connection ' with well - known matters of history relating thereto , ' and considering also the character of legislation during the period of the war , as establishing the intention of the legislature that the warrants should circulate as money . It is stated in the opinion that the legislation , providing the purpose for which they could be used and the small amounts for which they could be issued , and also the size , shape , and color of the warrants , together with the history of the times and the well - known depleted condition of the treasury during that period , and the scarcity of existing , reliable , and available circulating medium , as money , all showed that the purpose of the various acts of the legislature was to give to the warrants issued during that time as much as possible a standing and character as money . The court therefore held that the warrants were void , as issued in violation of the Constitution of the state ; the payment made in them was in law no payment ; that no contract arose between the state and the company by reason of the use made of the warrants in surrendering them to the comptroller , and that therefore no defense to plaintiff 's cause of action was established .	@@empty@@	unmatched
These warrants were issued pursuant to appropriations made by the legislature and in payment of debts existing at the time in favor of the individuals to whom they were delivered . They were payable at once , and if there had been funds of the state in the treasury they would have been immediately paid and canceled . It was only because there was no money in the treasury that they were not paid . The state therefore provided that they might be received in payment of taxes or dues to the state , and that its officers might disburse them in payment of its debts to any person who would consent to receive them , but that when presented to the treasurer of the state and received by him they should be canceled .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We have been referred to no act making provision for the size , shape , or color of the paper to be used for the warrants , and such size , etc . , can not be regarded as evidence of any weight as to the intent on the part of the legislature that they should circulate as money ; nor does the depleted condition of the treasury or the scarcity of a circulating medium necessarily or properly induce to that conclusion . That the size of the warrant , both as to amount and shape , might somewhat facilitate a holder , upon occasion , to discharge a debt and in that way use it as money , is not at all sufficient , or indeed any proper , evidence of an unlawful intent on the part of the legislature . The act of December 16 , 1863 , is not the slightest evidence on the subject . It simply provided for taxing specie , treasury notes of the Confederate States , treasury warrants of the state , and bank notes held or owned in the state . It also provided a tax upon foreign bills of exchange and other evidences of money on deposit or secured beyond the limits of the state and owned by persons residing therein , and provided that they should be known as specie . The fact that treasury warrants were mixed up in such an act for the purpose of taxation with specie , bills of exchange , certificates of deposit , etc . , has not the slightest tendency to prove the intent that the warrants should circulate as money .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It does not seem to us that this legislation shows that the warrants were thus issued within the meaning either of the state or the Federal Constitution . The only provision looking towards a treatment of the warrants in any manner as money is the direction to the state 's own officers to receive them as payment for taxes and dues to the state , and to pay them as money to such persons as would receive then in payment of the indebtedness of the state to them .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The fact that a creditor of the state , willing to receive payment in these warrants , might demand that they should be issued to him in small sums , and not in one single warrant , does not bear with great force upon the intent of the legislature that the warrants should thereafter circulate as money . It does not show that those warrants were intended to so circulate between individuals for the ordinary purposes of society and in the general transactions of business between citizens . For the state to say that the warrants should be transferred or disbursed by its own officers as money , if the person entitled to a transfer or disbursement from the state would receive them as money , simply amounts to a declaration that the warrants should be issued to all such persons as would accept them in payment of the debts due them from the state . To encourage such willingness the provision was made that these warrants should be receivable as money ; that is , as payment for certain debts due the state , as for taxes , etc . This use of the words ' as money ' has , in our judgment , no further significance , and has no force for the purpose of showing the intention of the legislature to have the warrants circulate generally as money and to form a circulating medium of that kind of paper .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It must not only be that they are capable of sometimes being used instead of money , but they must have a fitness for general circulation in the community as a representative and substitute for money in the common transactions of business . This is what is meant by the expression ' intended to circulate as money . ' These warrants were payable to the individual to whom the state was indebted , or to bearer , and were issued to a creditor of the state . That the legislature may have desired to facilitate the use of the warrants by these provisions is perhaps true . But the members of the legislature knew that to issue the warrants to circulate as money would be to condemn them from the start . That the promise should be made to receive them in payment of debts due the state would add to their usefulness and to the willingness of people to take them in payment of debts due them from the state , and that while in their hands others might receive them in payment of debts , was a possibility or probability depending upon whether the person taking them had opportunity to use them to pay some of his own debts to the state . That he might on some occasion be able to so use the warrant as to enable him to thereby discharge an obligation from himself to a third person who was willing to accept it does not bring the warrant so used within the ordinary meaning of the term ' money . ' It is not money in that sense .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The provision in the state is substantially the same as that in the Federal Constitution , in that the legislature is prohibited from issuing treasury warrants , treasury notes , or paper of any description intended to circulate as money , while in the Federal Constitution the prohibition is against a state 's emitting bills of credit ; and the necessity exists in both that the paper shall be issued to circulate as money , in order to be in violation of either instrument . It has been held that the bills of credit prohibited by the Federal Constitution are those which were intended to circulate as money , and hence the authorities as to the meaning of that expression , when so used , are applicable here .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In Craig v. Missouri , 4 Pet . 410 , 7 L. ed . 903 , Chief Justice Marshall , in referring to the meaning of the clause in the Constitution prohibiting a state from emitting bills of credit , said ( page 432 , L. ed . p. 911 ) :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' The word ' emit ' is never employed in describing those contracts by which a state binds itself to pay money at a future day for services actually received , or for money borrowed for present use ; nor are instruments executed for such purposes , in common language , denominated ' bills of credit . ' To ' emit bills of credit ' conveys to the mind the idea of issuing paper intended to circulate through the community for its ordinary purposes , as money , which paper is redeemable at a future day . This is the sense in which the terms have been always understood . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is true the court in the Craig Case held that the certificates authorized by the state of Missouri were void because they were in effect bills of credit . They were issued on account of loans made from time to time to the state , and were held to have been issued to circulate as money . The court then consisted of seven members , and Mr. Justice Johnson , Mr. Justice Thompson , and Mr. Justice McLean did not concur in the judgment . Mr. Justice Johnson thought that the term did not extend to certificates that bore interest and the value of which varied with each passing day ; that they approximated to bills drawn upon a fund , not to be withdrawn by any law of the state ; that the promise was also to receive in payment of debts and taxes due the state , and the certificates did not depend for value upon the faith of the state only , and hence they were not bills of credit .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Mr. Justice Thompson thought they were not bills of credit , for the reason , among others , that the act did not profess to make them a circulating medium or a substitute for money ; it made them only receivable for taxes , etc . , due the state , and those were special and limited objects not sufficient to enable the certificates to answer the purpose of a circulating medium to any considerable extent .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Mr. Justice McLean thought that to constitute a bill of credit it must be issued by a state , and its circulation as money enforced by statutory provisions . At page 454 , L. ed . p. 918 , he said : ' Where a warrant is issued for the amount due to a claimant , which is to be paid on presentation to the treasurer , can it be denominated a bill of credit ? ' He thought not .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In the subsequent case of Briscoe v. Bank of Kentucky , 11 Pet . 257 , 9 L. ed . 709 , the same question as to the meaning of the term ' bills of credit ' arose , and Mr. Justice McLean delivered the opinion of the court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The question was whether bank notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth of Kentucky , declared by the state act of incorporation to be exclusively the property of the commonwealth , were bills of credit . In the course of the opinion the judge stated , page 312 , L. ed . p. 731 : ' The terms ' bills of credit ' in their mercantile sense comprehend a great variety of evidences of debt , which circulate in a commercial country . . . . But the inhibition of the Constitution applies to bills of credit in a more limited sense . It would be difficult to classify the bills of credit which were issued in the early history of this country . They were all designed to circulate as money , being issued under the laws of the respective colonies . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
Reference is made in the course of the opinion to Craig v. Missouri , 4 Pet . 410 , 7 L. ed . 903 , and to the views of the two dissenting judges ( besides himself ) as to the meaning of the expression , and he ends the discussion of that part of the question by referring to what Chief Justice Marshall had said , and adding : ' The definition , then , which does include all classes of bills of credit emitted by the colonies or states , is a paper issued by the sovereign power containing a pledge of its faith and designed to circulate as money . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
It was held that the bank notes in question did not fill that definition . In Woodruff v. Trapnall , 10 How . 190 , 205 , 13 L. ed . 383 , the question was again referred to by Mr. Justice McLean in delivering the opinion of the court , and he said that the notes of the banks therein mentioned were not bills of credit , upon the authority of the Briscoe Case . To the same effect is Darrington v. Branch of The Bank of Alabama , 13 How . 12 , 14 L. ed . 30 , the opinion being also delivered by Mr. Justice McLean . The state creating the bank in that case was the only stockholder and its credit was pledged for the ultimate redemption of the notes of the bank .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The court said it was impossible to hold that bills issued by the bank came within the definition of bills of credit . Briscoe v. Bank of Kentucky , 11 Pet . 257 , 9 L. ed . 709 , was again referred to , and the definition approved , that the paper must be issued by a state , upon its faith , designed to circulate as money , and to be received and used as such in the ordinary business of life .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In Poindexter v. Greenhow , 114 U. S. 270 , 283 , 29 L. ed . 185 , 190 , 5 Sup . Ct . Rep. 903 , 962 , the coupons in question were in the ordinary form , and one of them was set out in the opinion of the court , and is as follows :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' Receivable at and after maturity for all taxes , debts , and demands due the State .	@@empty@@	unmatched
' The Commonwealth , of Virginia will pay the bearer thirty dollars interest , due 1st January , 1884 , on bond No . 2,731 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
' Coupon No . 20 . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
' Geo . Rye , Treasurer . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
It was contended that this coupon was a bill of credit in the sense of the Constitution , because receivable in payment of debts due the state , and negotiable by delivery merely , and intended to pass from hand to hand and to circulate as money .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It was in consequence of unrestrained is sues of paper money by the colonial and state governments , based alone upon credit , said the court , that this clause in the Constitution prohibiting the emission of bills of credit by the states was adopted , and the proper definition of the term was not founded on the abstract meaning of the words so as to include everything in the nature of an obligation to pay money , reposing on the public faith and subject to future redemption , but was limited to those particular forms or evidences of debt that had been so abused to the detriment of both private and public interests .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Speaking of these particular coupons the court said :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' They are issued by the state , it is true . They are promises to pay money . Their payment and redemption are based on the credit of the state , but they were not emitted by the state , in the sense in which a government emits its treasury notes , or a bank its bank notesa circulating medium or paper currencyas a substitute for money . And there is nothing on the face of the instruments nor in their form or nature , nor in the terms of the law which authorized their issue , nor in the circumstances of their creation or use , as shown by the record , on which to found an inference that these coupons were designed to circulate , in the common transactions of business , as money , nor that in fact they were so used . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
The fact that the coupons were receivable in payment of taxes and other dues to the state , and hence might circulate from hand to hand as money , was held to fall far short of showing their fitness for general circulation in the community as the representative and substitute for money in the common transaction of business , which the court held was necessary to bring them within the constitutional prohibition against bills of credit . This reasoning applies with equal force to treasury warrants . Both classes of paper must be intended to circulate as money , and the same conditions regarding such intention , and the same evidence to prove it , would be necessary in each case .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In the light of these authorities , it seems to us that it can not be properly said that the treasury warrants violated the Constitution , either of the state or of the United States , because there is no evidence that they were intended to circulate as money within the meaning of that term as already given . The record does not show that the legislature intended that these warrants should or that they could be so used as to circulate among the people as money , to be used by them as a paper currency or a circulating medium in their dealings with each other . Small denominations of the warrants would certainly facilitate their retirement through their use for payment of taxes and other debts due the state , and would increase their convenience for paying freight or passenger fare to the companies , which would then have an opportunity to present them to the state in payment of interest ; and as the laws did not provide for their circulation as money , but only to be received or paid by the officers of the state between the state and its debtors and creditors and to the railroad companies , as stated , it can not be supposed from such evidence that it was the intention of the legislature that these warrants should be circulated as money , and should thus violate the provisions of the Constitution .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A warrant drawn by the state authorities in payment of an appropriation made by the legislature , where the warrant is payable upon presentation if there be funds in the treasury , and which has been issued to an individual in payment of the debt of the state to him , can not , as it seems to us , be properly called a bill of credit or a treasury warrant intended to circulate as money . Although the state directed its officers to receive the warrants as money , in payment of certain dues to the state , and to deliver them to those who would receive them as money in payment of dues from the state to such persons , yet , as we have already remarked , this direction was only another mode of expressing the idea that , as between the state and the individual , the delivery of the warrant should operate as a payment of the debt for which the delivery was made . When the warrants once came back to the treasurer of the state they were not to be reissued . The decisions of this court have shown great reluctance under this provision as to bills of credit , to interfere with or reduce the very important and necessary power of the states to pay their debts by delivering to their creditors their written promises to pay them on demand , and in the meantime to receive the paper as payment of debts due the state for taxes and other like matters .	@@empty@@	unmatched
If any fair doubt could arise , it should be solved in favor of the validity of the paper . There must be an intention on the part of the legislature that the paper should circulate as money . There must , in other words , be an intention to violate the Constitution .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A deliberate intention on the part of a legislative body to violate the organic law of the state under which it exists and to which the members have sworn obedience is not to be lightly indulged . The existence of such intention should be proved beyond doubt or cavil , from the very acts themselves which are under discussion , and , if it be reasonably possible to so construe them as to render them valid , a proper respect for the legislative department calls for such construction , rather than one which invalidates them because they were enacted with a direct purpose to violate the state Constitution .	@@empty@@	unmatched
But if for the purpose of this argument it should be assumed that the warrants , although issued to those who were the creditors of the state and in payment of the debts due from the state to those creditors , were nevertheless issued to circulate as money , and therefore in violation of the Constitution , it can not be properly held , in our opinion , that the receipt of such warrants , pursuant to legislative authority and in payment of an indebtedness due the state from the individual paying them , is an illegal transaction and amounts in law to no payment whatever .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The state was debtor to the individuals to whom the warrants were first issued in payment of that indebtedness , and all that can be said that it violated the law , by giving this particular form to the instrument by which it assumed to pay its debt . Surely if for that reason the delivery of the warrants constituted no payment , the state would have the right to make such payment in some other way . If , by reason of the violation of the Constitution , its direction to the treasurer to pay the warrant was void , and no action could be maintained upon the warrant by reason of its invalidity ( aside from the fact that the state would not be suable ) , there is certainly nothing to prevent the state from recognizing the debt it actually owed and which it assumed to pay by issuing these warrants . That recognition may be contained in the very law which authorizes their issue , or in some other law . When , therefore , it passed the statutes providing that the warrants should be received in payment of taxes and other dues to it , and also by the comptroller in payment of the interest and sinking fund due from the railroad companies to the state , and when by virtue of such authority the state officers actually did receive the warrants for such payments , we see no illegality in the payments , and it seems to us that credit therefor should be given accordingly .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Suppose that the state , intending to issue these warrants to circulate as money , had paid them through its officers to its creditors , and had then become convinced that the warrants were a violation of the Constitution of the state and ought not to have been issued . Could not the state say to the creditors to whom these warrants had been paid , if you will give them back we will pay you in a form that is not a violation of the Constitution ? Would anybody suspect that surrendering these warrants to the state and receiving other warrants in their stead , in a form which did not violate the Constitution , would be an illegal act on the part of the state ? The original warrants having been issued to various creditors of the state , and they very likely having transferred them to others , wherein would consist the illegality if the state offered to and did receive those warrants from such others , and paid their amount in valid obligations ? Instead of paying their amounts in valid obligations , where is the invalidity if the state offers to receive them and to cancel obligations which the party owes to it , to an amount equal to their face value ? All this is but another way of paying the indebtedness which the state originally owed to the individuals to whom it issued these warrants , and when it cancels obligations due to it of an amount which equals the face value of the warrants , and receives the warrants in return , the legal effect is the same as if the warrants had never been transferred by the persons to whom they were originally issued , and they had brought them back to the state , and the state had given in exchange for them some valid evidence of indebtedness .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It seems to us that the same principle is involved as was enforced in Hitchcock v. Galveston , 96 U. S. 341 , 350 , 24 L. ed . 659 , 661 , where a city had contracted with the plaintiffs for the improvement of its sidewalks , and agreed to pay for the same in bonds which it was beyond the power of the city to issue . It was held that the invalidity of that promise was no reason why the city should not pay for the benefits which it had received from the performance of the contract . The court said : ' If payments can not be made in bonds because their issue is ultra vires , it would be sanctioning rank injustice to hold that payments need not be made at all . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
Suppose in that case the bonds had been issued by the city in violation of its charter . Could not the city thereafter , upon discovering its inability to make such a contract , receive the bonds back and make payment in some other way ? Or could it not have received the bonds as a payment to that extent of an indebtedness due from their holder to the city ?	@@empty@@	unmatched
Unless such transactions be legal , then it follows that the state could obtain the property or labor of the individual , and pay therefor in an obligation which it had no right to issue , and which it could on that account subsequently repudiate , and then deny all liability to pay at all . The character of the transaction is not altered by the transfer of these warrants from the original holder to other parties , and the state has full power to recognize in favor of the bearer of the warrants , the validity of the debt which they originally represented , and to pay the same by allowing a credit to their bearers up to the value of the warrants . We see nothing in morals or in law which should prevent the state from recognizing and liquidating the indebtedness which was due from it and which was represented by the warrants .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The other theory would prevent the state from ever redeeming warrants in form invalid but which had been issued in payment of debts due from the state to persons receiving them .	@@empty@@	unmatched
If payments such as were made in this case were not valid , but absolute nullities , then nay person who used the warrants to pay his taxes with , although they were received by the collector and an acquittance given , was nevertheless liable to pay those taxes again .

Their receipt by the state officers from the railroad company as directed by the legislature is also justified , as appears by the case of Little Rock v. Merchants ' Nat . Bank , 98 U. S. 308 , 25 L. ed . 108 . This court held that even if the bonds mentioned therein were issued in violation of law , yet when the city accepted their surrender and redeemed them by giving other bonds in lieu of a portion and a credit on the books of the city for another portion of them so surrendered , such transaction was valid , and the holder of the bonds so given in lieu of the illegal ones could recover on them and also upon the credit given on the books of the city . We preceive no reason why the state could not , if it chose , receive these warrants in discharge of the debt pro tanto due it from the company .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The next question is whether the payments made are void because the warrants were issued as alleged , in aid of the Rebellion .	@@empty@@	unmatched
If by reason of any fact existing at the time these transactions occurred , and which appears in this record , the payments in question were not valid , and no valid contract grew out of the same , then the judgment should be affirmed , notwithstanding we differ with the court below in regard to the effect of the payment , on the ground taken by that court . Until we are able to say there was a valid contract subsisting by reason of these transactions , by which payments were received as payment pro tanto of interest and sinking fund , we can not be called upon to discuss the question whether any legislation subsequent to the making of the alleged contract has impaired its obligation . We must therefore pursue the inquiry in order to determine the existence and validity of the contract .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is alleged that at least some of these warrants were issued in aid of the Rebellion , and were therefore void , and no attempted payments made in them could be recognized as legal or binding . Various acts of the legislature have been referred to which provided for the issuing of bonds in return for loans to the state for military purposes . The findings of the trial court upon the subject were as follows :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' I find that it has not been proved whether the warrants actually used in making the payments were warrants issued for indebtedness incurred prior to the civil war , or warrants issued for the state indebtedness incurred after the war began , or , if of the latter class , whether they were warrants issued for military purposes or for civil indebtedness ; but from the circumstantial evidence I conclude that neither the railroad company nor the state discriminated as to the class of warrants the railroads received for carrying services or paid on their indebtedness , and that some of all kinds were used in making the payments .	@@empty@@	unmatched
' In reaching the foregoing conclusions of fact I have excluded from my consideration the statements made in official reports and governors ' messages to the legislature , having concluded that defendant 's objections that the statements contained in these papers were not admissible as evidence proving or tending to prove the facts therein stated were good . I have also eliminated from consideration certain other evidence , as shown by explanations attached to defendant 's bills of exception . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
Taking these findings , it seems that some of the warrants had been originally issued for military purposes , while others had been issued for civil indebtedness . It is also to be inferred from the record that the warrants were in the hands of various people , residents in the state , from whom they had been purchased by the company for a fair and adequate consideration , or had been received by it at par in payment of freight or passenger services over its lines of road . Assuming that the warrants were invalid as having been issued in payment for services rendered , or stores received for use in aid of the Rebellion , yet this contract between the state and the company had no connection with the purpose for which they were issued , nor was the consideration of the contract hased in the remotest degree with reference to that purpose . The warrants were issued to other persons having not the slightest relation to the company , and in payment of an indebtedness for purposes to which the company was an entire stranger . The purpose of the company was undoubtedly pursuant to the offers of the state made in the acts mentioned , to use the warrants in payment of what might be due for principal or interest on the bonds of the company held by the state . There is no proof that the company received the warrants for any other purpose . No inference could properly , as we think , be drawn from the evidence that there was any intent , design , or wish on its part to aid the Rebellion by the acquisition of these warrants , and , so far as can be seen , it was a transaction in the way of the business of the company , entered into for the simple purpose of paying an indebtedness which it owed the state , and which , by these acts , the state permitted to be paid in this way . Even though portions of the warrants had been procured at less than par , of which fact there is no affirmative evidence , still the transaction on the part of the company did not thereby become one in aid of the Rebellion , and upon this point we do not see that the prices which may have been paid for the warrants were material in the inquiry . The contract between the state and the company did not in any way aid the former in issuing them , nor did it aid the purpose for which the state may have desired to issue them .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Where the validity of a contract is attacked on the ground of its illegal purpose , that purpose must clearly appear ; and it will not be inferred simply because the performance of the contract might possibly result in a remote , incidental , and unintentional aid to an illegal transaction .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is somewhat difficult to see how the offer to receive these warrants , and their reception pursuant to the offer , can be said to be illegal as based upon a consideration which looked to aiding the Rebellion by its performance .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It has been held that a contract between parties resident within the lines of insurrectionary states , stipulating for payment in Confederate notes issued in furtherance of a scheme to overturn the authority of the United States within the territory dominated by the Confederate States , was not to be regarded for that reason only as invalid . Contracts thus made , not designed to aid an insurrectionary government , it was held , could not therefore , without manifest injustice to the parties , be treated as invalid . Thorington v. Smith , 8 Wall . 1 , 19 L. ed . 361 ; Delmas v. Merchants ' Ins . Co. 14 Wall . 661 , 20 L. ed . 757 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The receipt of these warrants , like the contract to receive payment in Confederate notes , was not for that reason only unlawful , although the state was the party that received them . The company was not an agent of the state in putting them in circulation , nor is there any proof that in fact it circulated any of them . The company did not take them for the purpose of giving currency to them , but in order to consummate a transaction which , when consummated , was simply a business one on the part of the company , and if by any possibility it could ' indirectly or remotely promote the ends of the de facto government organized to effect a dissolution of the Union , it was without blame , except when proved to have been entered into with actual intent to further invasion or insurrection .

A specimen of the contract condemned under the rule is to be found in Sprott v. United States , 20 Wall . 459 , 22 L. ed . 371 , where the plaintiff sought to recover from the defendant the value of certain cotton which he had purchased from and paid the price in money to the Confederate government , and which the Union forces took from its possession in the last days of the existence of that government . The court held that in the transaction the plaintiff gave aid and assistance to the Rebellion in the most efficient manner he possibly could ; that he could not have aided that cause more acceptably if he had entered its service and become a blockade runner , or under the guise of a privateer had preyed upon the unoffending commerce of his country . The plaintiff asked the court to in effect carry out his void contract with the Confederate government . That is very different from holding that these warrants were so far void that they could not form the basis of payment of debts by their holders , who had not received them from the state , but had taken them in the course of business from other parties , and who then offered them in payment of their debts due the state .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This whole subject has recently been gone over in Baldy v. Hunter , 171 U. S. 388 , 43 L. ed . 208 , 18 Sup . Ct . Rep. 890 , where many other cases are commented upon , and the principle of that and the other decisions of this court therein referred to would seem to hold this contract not unlawful .	@@empty@@	unmatched
But suppose these warrants were issued in aid of the Rebellion and were therefore void , and that the subsequent offer of the state to receive them in payment of the debt of the company , under the provisions of the legislative acts already referred to , was , while unexecuted , also void on that ground , still , their actual receipt and the acquittance given were not , for that reason , void as between these parties .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A contract in aid of the Rebellion has been held illegal because it belonged to that class of contracts which are mala in se , whose consideration is immoral and founded upon a criminal purpose . If a state were a party to such a contract it would not be void on the technical ground that it was ultra vires as beyond the contract - making power of the state , but because of the illegal nature of its consideration . The contract would be void for the same reason that it would be void as between individuals , not because they had no capacity to make it , but because , being founded upon an illegal consideration , no court would recognize its validity or enforce its provisions . A state as a sovereignty has power generally to make contracts , unless there be some constitutional inhibition as to certain classes of contracts , and if the consideration of a particular contract is bad or immoral , the contract is illegal because of the character of its consideration , and not because the contract would be beyond the general scope and power of the state . Hence , as between the parties to it , the state might , if it chose , perform all its requirements , and if the acts of its officers were performed in obedience to legislative authority , their performance in executing the contract would be the act of the state . If , on the other hand , the Constitution of the state had prohibited its officers from ever receiving anything but gold in payment of this debt of the company , a delivery of something else in assumed payment of the debt , though received as such by its officers under the authority of the legislature , would be no payment . That would be a case where the payment would be absolutely void because beyond the capacity of the state to authorize and equally beyond its capacity to ratify . It would be ultra vires in the strict sense of the term . In such event , it would be true that the act of the officer would be his individual act , and in no sense would he represent or bind the state by his action . Such an attempted payment might therefore be regarded by any subsequent officer of the state as wholly void and ineffectual for any purpose .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The distinction between the two cases is obvious . In the one the contract is void because of the illegality of the consideration , not because of the legal incapacity of either party to make the contract , while in the other there is an entire lack of power to make it under any circumstances . When , therefore , the officers of the state pursuant to its statutes received the warrants as payment , they acted for the state in carrying out an offer upon its part which the state had the legal capacity to make and to carry out , and which it in this manner did carry out . The state in such case had the same power to carry out its contract ( so far as the parties to it are concerned ) as individuals would have had to carry out the same kind of a contract , and when the warrants were received by the officers acting for the state in payment of the interest , and the bonds of the state were issued to the school fund , and acquittance given to the company , the transaction was finished and completed , in the case of the state , just as it would have been in like circumstances in the case of the individual , and by such action ( as between the parties ) the state is bound ; the acts of its officers are its own acts , and it must be judged in the same way as an individual would be judged . In other words , the contract having been fully executed by the company and the state , neither party having chosen to refuse to perform its terms , neither party as between themselves can thereafter act as if the contract had not been performed , nor can the state pass any act which shall impair the obligation which springs from its performance . After the complete execution of the transaction it must be that each party thereupon and at once became possessed of certain legal rights arising from its performance . Neither party could undo what had been fully executed and completed , and the law therefore implies a contract that neither party will attempt to do so , or , in other words , the law implies a contract that the payments made shall not be thereafter repudiated or denied . Any subsequent statute of the state which repudiated or permitted the repudiation of the payments would impair the obligation of the contract which the law raises from the transaction itself .	@@empty@@	unmatched
That a contract will be implied under such circumstances is stated in Planters ' Bank v. Union Bank , 16 Wall . 483 , 500 , 21 L. ed . 473 , 480 . There the court said : ' Some of the authorities show that , though an illegal contract will not be executed , yet when it has been executed by the parties themselves , and the illegal object of it has been accomplished the money or thing which was the price of it may be a legal consideration between the parties for a promise , express or implied , and the court will not unravel the transaction to discover its origin . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
So in this case . The illegal object was fully executed and accomplished , and upon its accomplishment and by reason of the whole transaction there arose an implied contract that the settlement should be conclusive upon all parties to it . This principle calls for no aid from the court in the enforcement of a void contract . The parties have already fully complied with all its terms , and by reason thereof the implied contract has arisen .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The state can not now be permitted to repudiate or set aside the acts of its former officers , done in pursuance of the direction of the legislature of the state , and effectually and forever closed long before the present proceeding was commenced . As between the parties to those transactions this can not be done .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The action of the present officers of the state in bringing this proceeding has been undoubtedly prompted by the best motives and from a desire to promote the true interests of their state , but we nevertheless are unable to see how the proceeding can be successful without overturning those principles of law which must guide and control our judgment .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We are then brought to the question whether the subsequent legislation of the state has in any manner impaired the obligation of the contracts made by the state at the times when these various payments were made .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We have shown , in the treatment of the motion to dismiss , how the judgment of the court below gave effect to the subsequent act of 1870 . In giving such effect , was the obligation of the contract between the parties impaired thereby ?	@@empty@@	unmatched
If the state had passed no act the question of contract could not have been raised in this court , the payments might have been repudiated , and the court have held them illegal , and we would have no jurisdiction to review its judgment . But the state has passed a statute , and said that if the company would pay interest and a certain proportion semiannually upon the aggregate amount of the loan as it stood May 1 , 1870 , no further exaction would be made . The court has construed this to mean that if the company will pay such proportion semiannually on the amount of the loan , to be ascertained by striking out the payments in warrants , then no default will be incurred , but if not , then it will have made default , and the act of 1870 provides in such case for proceedings to collect the amount due . We say the court below has so construed the act , and we say so notwithstanding it has not mentioned it in any such connection . It has said so , however , by implication necessarily arising from the judgment it has given , when taken in connection with the provision of the act which permits proceedings only to be taken on a default , which does not exist in this case if the company be credited with these warrants as payments . By permitting the proceedings the court has necessarily construed the act as meaning that there is a default when payments are not made on the basis of the invalidity of the payments in warrants . The obligation of the contract which we hold existed between the state and the company , growing out of the transactions mentioned , has therefore , by this construction of the act by the state court , been materially impaired .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is alleged on the part of the state that the acceptance of the treasury warrants in payment of money loaned from the school fund was a violation of the Constitution of the state of Texas , as being an illegal diversion of that fund .

Mr. Justice Brown concurring :	@@empty@@	unmatched
I concur in the conclusion of the court , but from so much of the opinion as holds that the treasury warrants in question were not bills of credit within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States I am constrained to dissent .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is admitted that these warrants fulfil all the conditions of bills of credit , except , as it is said , they were not intended to circulate as money . I am unable to concur in this view of the intent of the legislature . By the act of February 14 , 1860 , authorizing interest - bearing warrants on the treasury , it was expressly provided that these warrants should not circulate as money , but might be assigned . This act was repealed , however , in 1862 , by another act providing that warrants should be drawn for legal claims against the state , and payment made if there were money in the treasury ; but if not , the comptroller was authorized to issue warrants payable to the party entitled to payment , or bearer , which warrants should be of such proportions of the claim as were required by the holder , one tenth of the whole amount of which might be issued in warrants of $ 1 each , and the residue in warrants of $ 5 or more each . There was an omission in this act , which appears to me extremely significant , of the proviso of the former act that such warrants should not circulate as money . By another act , approved the following day , it was provided that treasury warrants of the state , not bearing interest , should be receivable ' as money ' in the payment of taxes , office fees ( including fees for patents ) , and land dues payable in the general land office of Texas , and all other dues to be collected for the state , with certain specified exceptions . By another act of December 16 , 1863 , the comptroller was authorized to receive from the railroad companies indebted to the special school fund all interest on their bonds that might be or might thereafter become due in state treasury warrants . This act was amended May 28 , 1864 , by providing that the act of 1863 should not apply to railroad companies which refused to receive these bonds or treasury warrants at par for freight or passage , at the prices or rates established by law .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The railway companies were thus compelled to receive these warrants as money from their patrons , in order to be able to avail themselves of them in payment of interest upon their bonds . In addition to this the warrants were in the form of bank notes , printed upon peculiar paper , such as is ordinarily used by banks for their circulating notes , and contained a brief and unconditional promise of the state to pay the amount to a party named , or bearer , and were declared on their face to be receivable for public dues .	@@empty@@	unmatched
If these facts be not decisive of an intention that these warrants should circulate as money , it is difficult to say what additional facts were needed to manifest that intent . Indeed , the opinion of the court seems to me to practically eliminate from the Constitution the provision that the states shall not emit bills of credit , as well as to overrule the opinion of this court in Craig v. Missouri , 4 Pet . 410 , 7 L. ed . 903 . In that case the legislature of the state of Missouri authorized the officers of the state treasury to issue certificates , of denominations not exceeding $ 10 nor less than 50 cents , in the following form : ' This certificate shall be receivable at the treasury of any of the loan offices in the state of Missouri , in discharge of taxes or debts due to the state , for the sum of _ _ _ _ _ dollars , with interest for the same , at the rate of 2 per cent per annum from this date . ' These certificates were receivable at the treasury in payment of taxes or moneys due to the state or to any municipality , and by all officers , civil and military , in the discharge of salaries and fees of office . If simple certificates of the state , containing no promise to pay , are bills of credit , much more , it seems to me , should these obligations of the state of Texas issued in denominations of $ 1 and upwards , in the size , shape , and color of bank notes , and receivable in discharge of all taxes and debts due the state , to which a forced circulation was given as between railways and their patrons , be held to be obnoxious to the same provision of the Constitution . As was said by Chief Justice Marshall in that case : ' The denominations of the bills , from $ 10 to 50 cents , fitted them for the purpose of ordinary circulation ; and their reception in payment of taxes and debts to the government and to corporations , and of salaries and fees would give them currency . They were to be put into circulation ; that is , emitted by the government . In addition to all these evidences of an intention to make these certificates the ordinary circulating medium of the country , the law speaks of them in this character , and directs the auditor and treasurer to withdraw annually one tenth of them from circulation . Had they been termed ' bills of credit , ' instead of ' certificates , ' nothing would have been wanting to bring them within the prohibitory words of the Constitution . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
But I fully concur with the court upon the second point , that the state , having issued these warrants for a valuable consideration , having put them in circulation , having expressly authorized the railroad companies to pay them in discharge of their interest upon their bonds , and having received them without objection at the time , it is too late now to claim that they did not operate as payment . Though the warrants may have been issued without authority , it was competent for the state to recognize them , and to refuse now to admit them as payment upon these bonds appears to me a plain violation of the public faith . Upon the theory of the court of civil appeals , I see nothing to prevent the state , unless there be a statute of limitations operative against it , from bringing suit against everybody who paid these warrants to the state for taxes or for dues , and recovering the amount a second time .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Mr. Justice SHIRAS , after stating the facts in the foregoing language , delivered the opinion of the court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The plaintiff 's original petition in the district court of Lamar county disclosed that the injuries complained of were received in August , 1888 , while the railroad was in the hands of John C. Brown , receiver , and alleged that the property of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company was placed in the hands of said John C. Brown as receiver , at the instance of the said Railroad company , and for its own benefit , and for the purpose of avoiding its traffic liability in the carrying of passengers and freight . The petition further alleged that the property of the said railroad company was never sold by said receiver to pay its debts , and was never contemplated to be sold , and that the entire earnings and current receipts of the said railroad while in the hands of the receiver , amounting to more than two millions of dollars , were applied to the payment of mortgage debts and in the betterment of the property of the company . It also alleged that by an order made on January 2 , 1889 , by the United States circuit court for the Eastern district of Louisiana , John C. Brown was directed to make delivery unto the said Texas & Pacific Railway Company of all property , funds , and assets in his hands as such receiver , and that he be directed to account to said company according to his account filed and approved up to June 1 , 1888 , and for all receipts and expenditures by him received and made since the said June 1 , 1888 , such delivery to be made as of October 31 , 1888 ; and it was further ordered that said receiver be discharged on said October 31 , 1888 , from his receivership , on payment of all costs legally taxed , and thereupon his bond vacated and canceled . The said order , a copy of which was attached as an exhibit to plaintiff 's petition , contained the following further provisions :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' It is further ordered that said property , nevertheless , shall be delivered to and received by said Texas & Pacific Railway Company , subjected to and charged with all traffic liabilities due to connecting lines and all contracts for which said receiver is or might be held under or in any way liable , and subject also to any and all judgments which have heretofore been rendered in favor of interveners in this case , and which have not been paid , as well as to such judgments as may be hereafter rendered by the court in favor of interveners while it retains the cases for their determination , or interveners now pending and undetermined , or which may be filed prior to February , 1889 , together with needful expenses of defending said claims , and upon the condition that such liabilities and obligations of the receiver , when so recognized and adjudged , may be enforced against said property in the hands of said company or its assignees to the same extent they could have been enforced if said property had not been surrendered into the possession of said company , and was still in the hands of the court ; and with the further condition that the court may , if needful for the protection of the receiver 's obligations and liabilities so recognized by this court , assume possession of said property . The bills in these cases will be retained for the purpose of investigating such liabilities and obligations , and for such other purposes as may seem needful . It is ordered that all claims against the receiver as such , up to said October 31 , 1888 , be presented and prosecuted by intervention prior to February 1 , 1889 , and , if not so presented by that date , that the same be barred , and shall not be a charge on the property of said company . It is further ordered that the said receiver advertise in a daily newspaper in New Orleans and in Dallas the fact of his said discharge , and a notice to said claimants to make claim within the time aforesaid , to wit , before February 1 , 1889 , and that he post a printed notice of similar purport in the station houses of said railway . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
The first contention on behalf of the plaintiff in error is that , as whatever claim plaintiff acquired by reason of her injury was one not against the defendant company , but against the receiver operating the road at the time under the orders of the court appointing him , and as it was within the power of such court , on terminating the receivership , to make and provide for settlement of all claims of parties against such receiver growing out of his operation of the road , and as , in the present instance , by its order , the circuit court had made such provision by directing that all claims against the receiver should be presented and prosecuted by intervention prior to February 1 , 1889 , and that , if not so presented by that date , the same be barred , and shall not be a charge on the property of said company ; and that , as the plaintiff did not so present or prosecute her claim , she was thereby precluded from maintaining an action against the company .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Undoubtedly , if this were a controversy between a party whose claim originated while a railroad was in the control of a receiver appointed during a foreclosure suit , and a purchaser at a judicial sale decreed under that proceeding , the plaintiff 's proposition would be a sound one . If the property sequestrated had gone to sale , and a fund had been thus realized for distribution , then , upon notice appropriate to proceedings in rem , such a claimant would , in the absence of special and unusual circumstances , have been bound by the disposition so made .	@@empty@@	unmatched
But the present case is one in which no judicial sale was made , and no fund realized for distribution by final decree after notice to and a hearing of those having claims against the fund . It was not the ordinary case of a sale and purchase in which compliance with stipulated conditions forms part of the consideration , and in which the extent of the burdens assumed is defined . Here , the railroad and its appurtenances , whose value was largely enhanced during the pendency of the receivership , were returned to the possession of the railroad company ; and while it was proper for the court , in order to protect its receiver , to make an order for those who had claims against him to bring them forward for disposition , it by no means follows that the company took back its property free from all claims that may have originated during the receivership . Such might be the case if the claim originated in some personal delinquency of the receiver , for which he and his bondsmen could be held responsible . But where the claim was incidental to the ordinary management of the railroad , not attributable to personal misconduct of the receiver , and where the court which had appointed the receiver had not been put in possession of a fund by a foreclosure sale , but had , at the request of the company and its mortgage creditors , restored its property to the railroad company , while such a claim was pending , we are unable to concede that an order of the kind that was made in this case precluded the plaintiff from enforcing her claim . There is present no element of estoppel in favor of the railroad company ; for the plaintiff 's judgment , obtained after a trial in which the company 's defense on the merits was fully heard , would have to be paid , and it would be a matter of indifference , so far as the pecuniary result is concerned , whether the claim was satisfied by the action of the court when discharging its receiver , or by remedial proceedings against the company after the foreclosure suit had been abandoned .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We think the order in question , fairly interpreted , meant that the court , when about to release the receiver and his bondsmen by a determination of the foreclosure proceedings and a discharge of the receiver , gave an opportunity to those who had claims to present them ; but that , after February 1 , 1889 , those who had not intervened would cease to be entitled to resort to the circuit court in the equity suit , and would be remitted to such other remedies as might be within their reach .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Such was the view of the nature of this order that was taken by this court in the case of Railway Co. v. Johnson , 151 U. S. 81 , 14 Sup . Ct . 250 , which was a case involving the same proceedings which are now under consideration .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It was indisputably shown at the trial , by the testimony of the receiver himself , that the earnings of the railroad while operated by him largely exceeded the expenses , and that a very large sum was applied by him to improvements and new equipments , so that ' the road was turned over to the company in far better condition and more valuable by far than when placed in the hands of the receiver .

Such a state of facts certainly discloses an equitable claim against the railroad on behalf of the plaintiff below .	@@empty@@	unmatched

' The circuit court of appeals erred in its judgment affirming the judgment of the circuit court in overruling the general demurrer presented by plaintiff in error to the petition of the defendant in error , for the reason that the matters alleged in said petition , if true as stated , disclose no cause of action at common law against plaintiff in error , nor any personal liability on the part of plaintiff in error to defendant in error such as could support an action at common law in said court ; but , if any cause of action or right in defendant in error was shown by such pleading , it was of an equitable nature , to wit , an equitable lien on the property of plaintiff in error , and defendant in error 's remedy was an equitable one against such property , and not by a suit at common law for a personal judgment against the plaintiff in error , and because the right asserted by defendant in error , and her remedies therefor could only be adjudicated and plead upon the equity side of said court , and by an appeal to said court sitting as a court of chancery . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
In sustaining this assignment , the counsel for the plaintiff in error complain of what is called a ' misapprehension ' by the circuit court of appeals of the case of Railway Co. v. Johnson , 151 U. S. 81 , 14 Sup . Ct . 250 , and they seek to distinguish that from the present case by calling attention to the fact that the former case came here by way of a writ of error to the supreme court of the state of Texas , and to the other fact that there was evidence in the Johnson Case tending to show that the receiver was appointed at the instigation of the railway company , and in order to enable it to improve its property by making repairs to its track and additions to its rolling stock by using therefor the earnings of the company during the receivership .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is true that , in meeting the argument that a personal judgment could not be rendered against the railway company because it was not liable for acts committed by the receiver , this court said , in the Johnson Case , that such a question was ' one of general law , and for the state court to pass upon . ' Nevertheless , this court , in reviewing the decision of the state court , said :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' In the view of that court a railway company might be held directly liable when a receiver is appointed in an amicable suit at the instigation of the company and for the company 's own purposes , and , these purposes being accomplished , the property is returned to its owner , the rights of no third persons intervening as purchasers , upon the ground that the acts of the receiver might well be regarded as the acts of its own servant , rather than those of an officer of the court , which , under such circumstances , he would only be sub modo . But as the court did not feel authorized to entertain a conclusion which might carry the implication that this receivership would have been created or continued , although its object had only been to place the property temporarily beyond the reach of creditors until it could be augmented in value by improvements made from earnings under the protection of the court , that rule was not applied in this case . The company was held liable upon the district ground that the earnings of the road were subject to the payment of claims for damages , and that as , in this instance , such earnings , to an extent far greater than sufficient to pay the plaintiff , had been diverted into betterments , of which the company had the benefit , it must respond directly for the claim . This was so by reason of the statute ( Laws Tex . 1887 , c. 131 ) , and , irrespective of statute , on equitable principles applicable under the facts . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
But although this court , in the Johnson Case , chose to rest its decision upon the well - settled ground that the decisions of the state court in the construction of state statutes are binding on this court , no disapproval was suggested or implied of the reasoning of the state court . And with a similar question now before us , in a case brought from a circuit court of the United States , we see no reason to reach a different conclusion .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It will be observed that in this branch of the case the plaintiff in error is conceding that the plaintiff below had a good cause of action against the receiver ; that she was not bound to prosecute her claim as part of the foreclosure proceedings ; and that the earnings of the railroad , to an amount largely exceeding the claim , had been diverted by the receiver to betterments . But the contention is that the plaintiff 's remedy , in such circumstances , was by proceedings in equity . This contention is founded on the proposition that the plaintiff 's right to a remedy is solely upon the ground that the income of the road while in the hands of the receiver had been applied to the improvement of the road , and it is argued that such a remedy can not go beyond the amount of the income so applied , and that the plaintiff must , therefore , follow the fund in equity , and is not entitled to sue and obtain a personal judgment against the holder of the fund ; that is , the railroad company in possession of the railroad increased in value by the betterments .	@@empty@@	unmatched
There is a general principle that a party having a right to resort to a fund in the hands of a receiver or trustee may have the aid of a court of equity in following that fund , where it has been improperly mingled with other funds , or has been invested in property in which third persons have an interest . That is a rule devised for the benefit of the party invoking it , but can not be applied , as we understand the facts of this case , to the detriment of the defendant in error . The railroad company did not , at the trial , pretend that the amount of the benefits received by reason of the betterments did not reach the amount of the plaintiff 's claim,indeed , the receiver 's testimony showed that the betterments amounted to several hundred thousands of dollars,but the company claimed then , as they do now , that the plaintiff 's only remedy was in equity . It is obvious that the only right or advantage that would accrue to the railroad company , if the plaintiff was compelled to resort to an equitable proceeding , would be the opportunity to show that the betterments received were less than the amount of the claim . The conduct of the railroad company in procuring , or , at least , in acquiescing in the withdrawal of , the receivership , and in the discharge of the receiver and the cancellation of his bond , and in accepting the restoration of its road , largely increased in value by the betterments , well affords ground to charge an assumpsit of such valid claims against the receiver as were not satisfied by him or by the court which discharged him . The company might , even in such circumstances , have a right to show that the claims exceeded the amount of the betterments , and have the aid of a court of equity to restrict its liability to that amount . But , as we have seen , it is not pretended that there is any such equity in the present case .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The judgment of the circuit court of appeals is affirmed .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Respondent hired attorney Low to represent him on a federal drug charge . The District Court denied Lows application for admission pro hac vice on the ground that he had violated a professional conduct rule and then , with one exception , prevented respondent from meeting or consulting with Low throughout the trial . The jury found respondent guilty . Reversing , the Eighth Circuit held that the District Court erred in interpreting the disciplinary rule , that the courts refusal to admit Low therefore violated respondents Sixth Amendment right to paid counsel of his choosing , and that this violation was not subject to harmless - error review .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
( b ) The Sixth Amendment violation is not subject to harmless - error analysis . Erroneous deprivation of the right to counsel of choice , with consequences that are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate , unquestionably qualifies as structural error.  Sullivan v. Louisiana , 508 U. S. 275 . It def[ies ] analysis by harmless error standards because it affec[ts ] the framework within which the trial proceeds and is not simply an error in the trial process itself. Arizona v. Fulminante , 499 U. S. 279 . Different attorneys will pursue different strategies with regard to myriad trial matters , and the choice of attorney will affect whether and on what terms the defendant cooperates with the prosecution , plea bargains , or decides to go to trial . It is impossible to know what different choices the rejected counsel would have made , and then to quantify the impact of those different choices on the outcome of the proceedings . This inquiry is not comparable to that required to show that a counsels deficient performance prejudiced a defendant . Pp . 811 .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
( c ) Nothing in the Courts opinion casts any doubt or places any qualification upon its previous holdings limiting the right to counsel of choice and recognizing trial courts authority to establish criteria for admitting lawyers to argue before them .

Respondent Cuauhtemoc Gonzalez - Lopez was charged in the Eastern District of Missouri with conspiracy to distribute more than 100 kilograms of marijuana . His family hired attorney John Fahle to represent him . After the arraignment , respondent called a California attorney , Joseph Low , to discuss whether Low would represent him , either in addition to or instead of Fahle . Low flew from California to meet with respondent , who hired him .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Some time later , Low and Fahle represented respondent at an evidentiary hearing before a Magistrate Judge . The Magistrate Judge accepted Lows provisional entry of appearance and permitted Low to participate in the hearing on the condition that he immediately file a motion for admission pro hac vice . During the hearing , however , the Magistrate Judge revoked the provisional acceptance on the ground that , by passing notes to Fahle , Low had violated a court rule restricting the cross - examination of a witness to one counsel .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The following week , respondent informed Fahle that he wanted Low to be his only attorney . Low then filed an application for admission pro hac vice . The District Court denied his application without comment . A month later , Low filed a second application , which the District Court again denied without explanation . Lows appeal , in the form of an application for a writ of mandamus , was dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Fahle filed a motion to withdraw as counsel and for a show - cause hearing to consider sanctions against Low . Fahle asserted that , by contacting respondent while respondent was represented by Fahle , Low violated Mo. Rule of Professional Conduct 44.2 ( 1993 ) , which prohibits a lawyer [i]n representing a client from communicat[ing ] about the subject of the representation with a party … represented by another lawyer without that lawyers consent . Low filed a motion to strike Fahles motion . The District Court granted Fahles motion to withdraw and granted a continuance so that respondent could find new representation . Respondent retained a local attorney , Karl Dickhaus , for the trial . The District Court then denied Lows motion to strike and , for the first time , explained that it had denied Lows motions for admission pro hac vice primarily because , in a separate case before it , Low had violated Rule 44.2 by communicating with a represented party .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The case proceeded to trial , and Dickhaus represented respondent . Low again moved for admission and was again denied . The Court also denied Dickhauss request to have Low at counsel table with him and ordered Low to sit in the audience and to have no contact with Dickhaus during the proceedings . To enforce the Courts order , a United States Marshal sat between Low and Dickhaus at trial . Respondent was unable to meet with Low throughout the trial , except for once on the last night . The jury found respondent guilty .	@@empty@@	unmatched
After trial , the District Court granted Fahles motion for sanctions against Low . It read Rule 44.2 to forbid Lows contact with respondent without Fahles permission . It also reiterated that it had denied Lows motions for admission on the ground that Low had violated the same Rule in a separate matter .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Respondent appealed , and the Eighth Circuit vacated the conviction . 399 F. 3d 924 ( 2005 ) . The Court first held that the District Court erred in interpreting Rule 44.2 to prohibit Lows conduct both in this case and in the separate matter on which the District Court based its denials of his admission motions . The District Courts denials of these motions were therefore erroneous and violated respondents Sixth Amendment right to paid counsel of his choosing . See i d . , at 928932 . The Court then concluded that this Sixth Amendment violation was not subject to harmless - error review . See i d . , at 932935 . We granted certiorari . 546 U. S. _ _ _ ( 2006 ) .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
The Sixth Amendment provides that [i]n all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right … to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence. We have previously held that an element of this right is the right of a defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him . See Wheat v. United States , 486 U. S. 153 , 159 ( 1988 ) . Cf . Powell v. Alabama , 287 U. S. 45 , 53 ( 1932 ) ( It is hardly necessary to say that , the right to counsel being conceded , a defendant should be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice ) . The Government here agrees , as it has previously , that the Sixth Amendment guarantees the defendant the right to be represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire , or who is willing to represent the defendant even though he is without funds. Caplin & Drysdale , Chartered v. United States , 491 U. S. 617 , 624625 ( 1989 ) . To be sure , the right to counsel of choice is circumscribed in several important respects. Wheat , supra , at 159 . But the Government does not dispute the Eighth Circuits conclusion in this case that the District Court erroneously deprived respondent of his counsel of choice .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
The Government contends , however , that the Sixth Amendment violation is not complete unless the defendant can show that substitute counsel was ineffective within the meaning of Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 , 691696 ( 1984 ) i.e . , that substitute counsels performance was deficient and the defendant was prejudiced by it . In the alternative , the Government contends that the defendant must at least demonstrate that his counsel of choice would have pursued a different strategy that would have created a reasonable probability that … the result of the proceedings would have been different, i d . , at 694in other words , that he was prejudiced within the meaning of Strickland by the denial of his counsel of choice even if substitute counsels performance was not constitutionally deficient . 1 To support these propositions , the Government points to our prior cases , which note that the right to counsel has been accorded … not for its own sake , but for the effect it has on the ability of the accused to receive a fair trial. Mickens v. Taylor , 535 U. S. 162 , 166 ( 2002 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . A trial is not unfair and thus the Sixth Amendment is not violated , the Government reasons , unless a defendant has been prejudiced .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
Stated as broadly as this , the Governments argument in effect reads the Sixth Amendment as a more detailed version of the Due Process Clauseand then proceeds to give no effect to the details . It is true enough that the purpose of the rights set forth in that Amendment is to ensure a fair trial ; but it does not follow that the rights can be disregarded so long as the trial is , on the whole , fair . What the Government urges upon us here is what was urged upon us ( successfully , at one time , see Ohio v. Roberts , 448 U. S. 56 ( 1980 ) ) with regard to the Sixth Amendments right of confrontationa line of reasoning that abstracts from the right to its purposes , and then eliminates the right. Maryland v. Craig , 497 U. S. 836 , 862 ( 1990 ) ( Scalia , J. , dissenting ) . Since , it was argued , the purpose of the Confrontation Clause was to ensure the reliability of evidence , so long as the testimonial hearsay bore indicia of reliability, the Confrontation Clause was not violated . See Roberts , supra , at 6566 . We rejected that argument ( and our prior cases that had accepted it ) in Crawford v. Washington , 541 U. S. 36 ( 2004 ) , saying that the Confrontation Clause commands , not that evidence be reliable , but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner : by testing in the crucible of cross - examination. Id. , at 61 .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
So also with the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice . It commands , not that a trial be fair , but that a particular guarantee of fairness be providedto wit , that the accused be defended by the counsel he believes to be best . The Constitution guarantees a fair trial through the Due Process Clauses , but it defines the basic elements of a fair trial largely through the several provisions of the Sixth Amendment , including the Counsel Clause. Strickland , supra , at 684685 . In sum , the right at stake here is the right to counsel of choice , not the right to a fair trial ; and that right was violated because the deprivation of counsel was erroneous . No additional showing of prejudice is required to make the violation complete. 2	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
The cases the Government relies on involve the right to the effective assistance of counsel , the violation of which generally requires a defendant to establish prejudice . See , e.g. , Strickland , supra , at 694 ; Mickens , supra , at 166 ; United States v. Cronic , 466 U. S. 648 ( 1984 ) . The earliest case generally cited for the proposition that the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel, McMann v. Richardson , 397 U. S. 759 , n. 14 ( 1970 ) , was based on the Due Process Clause rather than on the Sixth Amendment , see Powell , 287 U. S. , at 57 ( cited in e.g. , McMann , supra , at 771 , n. 14 ) . And even our recognition of the right to effective counsel within the Sixth Amendment was a consequence of our perception that representation by counsel is critical to the ability of the adversarial system to produce just results. Strickland , supra , at 685 . Having derived the right to effective representation from the purpose of ensuring a fair trial , we have , logically enough , also derived the limits of that right from that same purpose . See Mickens , supra , at 166 . The requirement that a defendant show prejudice in effective representation cases arises from the very nature of the specific element of the right to counsel at issue thereeffective ( not mistake - free ) representation . Counsel can not be ineffective unless his mistakes have harmed the defense ( or , at least , unless it is reasonably likely that they have ) . Thus , a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to effective representation is not complete until the defendant is prejudiced . See Strickland , supra , at 685 .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
The right to select counsel of ones choice , by contrast , has never been derived from the Sixth Amendments purpose of ensuring a fair trial . 3 It has been regarded as the root meaning of the constitutional guarantee . See Wheat , 486 U. S. , at 159 ; Andersen v. Treat , 172 U. S. 24 ( 1898 ) . See generally W. Beaney , The Right to Counsel in American Courts 1824 , 2733 ( 1955 ) . Cf . Powell , supra , at 53 . Where the right to be assisted by counsel of ones choice is wrongly denied , therefore , it is unnecessary to conduct an ineffectiveness or prejudice inquiry to establish a Sixth Amendment violation . Deprivation of the right is complete when the defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants , regardless of the quality of the representation he received . To argue otherwise is to confuse the right to counsel of choicewhich is the right to a particular lawyer regardless of comparative effectivenesswith the right to effective counselwhich imposes a baseline requirement of competence on whatever lawyer is chosen or appointed .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
Having concluded , in light of the Governments concession of erroneous deprivation , that the trial court violated respondents Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice , we must consider whether this error is subject to review for harmlessness . In Arizona v. Fulminante , 499 U. S. 279 ( 1991 ) , we divided constitutional errors into two classes . The first we called trial error, because the errors occurred during presentation of the case to the jury and their effect may be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether [ they were ] harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. , at 307308 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . These include most constitutional errors. Id. , at 306 . The second class of constitutional error we called structural defects. These defy analysis by harmless - error standards because they affec[t ] the framework within which the trial proceeds, and are not simply an error in the trial process itself. Id. , at 309310 . 4 See also Neder v. United States , 527 U. S. 1 , 79 ( 1999 ) . Such errors include the denial of counsel , see Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U. S. 335 ( 1963 ) , the denial of the right of self - representation , see McKaskle v. Wiggins , 465 U. S. 168 , n. 8 ( 1984 ) , the denial of the right to public trial , see Waller v. Georgia , 467 U. S. 39 , 49 , n. 9 ( 1984 ) , and the denial of the right to trial by jury by the giving of a defective reasonable - doubt instruction , see Sullivan v. Louisiana , 508 U. S. 275 ( 1993 ) .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
We have little trouble concluding that erroneous deprivation of the right to counsel of choice , with consequences that are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate , unquestionably qualifies as structural error.  Id. , at 282 . Different attorneys will pursue different strategies with regard to investigation and discovery , development of the theory of defense , selection of the jury , presentation of the witnesses , and style of witness examination and jury argument . And the choice of attorney will affect whether and on what terms the defendant cooperates with the prosecution , plea bargains , or decides instead to go to trial . In light of these myriad aspects of representation , the erroneous denial of counsel bears directly on the framework within which the trial proceeds, Fulminante , supra , at 310or indeed on whether it proceeds at all . It is impossible to know what different choices the rejected counsel would have made , and then to quantify the impact of those different choices on the outcome of the proceedings . Many counseled decisions , including those involving plea bargains and cooperation with the government , do not even concern the conduct of the trial at all . Harmless - error analysis in such a context would be a speculative inquiry into what might have occurred in an alternate universe .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Government acknowledges that the deprivation of choice of counsel pervades the entire trial , but points out that counsels ineffectiveness may also do so and yet we do not allow reversal of a conviction for that reason without a showing of prejudice . But the requirement of showing prejudice in ineffectiveness claims stems from the very definition of the right at issue ; it is not a matter of showing that the violation was harmless , but of showing that a violation of the right to effective representation occurred . A choice - of - counsel violation occurs whenever the defendants choice is wrongfully denied . Moreover , if and when counsels ineffectiveness pervades a trial , it does so ( to the extent we can detect it ) through identifiable mistakes . We can assess how those mistakes affected the outcome . To determine the effect of wrongful denial of choice of counsel , however , we would not be looking for mistakes committed by the actual counsel , but for differences in the defense that would have been made by the rejected counselin matters ranging from questions asked on voir dire and cross - examination to such intangibles as argument style and relationship with the prosecutors . We would have to speculate upon what matters the rejected counsel would have handled differentlyor indeed , would have handled the same but with the benefit of a more jury - pleasing courtroom style or a longstanding relationship of trust with the prosecutors . And then we would have to speculate upon what effect those different choices or different intangibles might have had . The difficulties of conducting the two assessments of prejudice are not remotely comparable . 5	@@empty@@	unmatched
Nothing we have said today casts any doubt or places any qualification upon our previous holdings that limit the right to counsel of choice and recognize the authority of trial courts to establish criteria for admitting lawyers to argue before them . As the dissent too discusses , post , at 3 , the right to counsel of choice does not extend to defendants who require counsel to be appointed for them . See Wheat , 486 U. S. , at 159 ; Caplin & Drysdale , 491 U. S. , at 624 , 626 . Nor may a defendant insist on representation by a person who is not a member of the bar , or demand that a court honor his waiver of conflict - free representation . See Wheat , 486 U. S. , at 159160 . We have recognized a trial courts wide latitude in balancing the right to counsel of choice against the needs of fairness , i d . , at 163164 , and against the demands of its calendar , Morris v. Slappy , 461 U. S. 1 , 1112 ( 1983 ) . The court has , moreover , an independent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them. Wheat , supra , at 160 . None of these limitations on the right to choose ones counsel is relevant here . This is not a case about a courts power to enforce rules or adhere to practices that determine which attorneys may appear before it , or to make scheduling and other decisions that effectively exclude a defendants first choice of counsel . However broad a courts discretion may be , the Government has conceded that the District Court here erred when it denied respondent his choice of counsel . Accepting that premise , we hold that the error violated respondents Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice and that this violation is not subject to harmless - error analysis .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed , and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion .	@@empty@@	unmatched
I disagree with the Courts conclusion that a criminal conviction must automatically be reversed whenever a trial court errs in applying its rules regarding pro hac vice admissions and as a result prevents a defendant from being represented at trial by the defendants first - choice attorney . Instead , a defendant should be required to make at least some showing that the trial courts erroneous ruling adversely affected the quality of assistance that the defendant received . In my view , the majoritys contrary holding is based on an incorrect interpretation of the Sixth Amendment and a misapplication of harmless - error principles . I respectfully dissent .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
The majority makes a subtle but important mistake at the outset in its characterization of what the Sixth Amendment guarantees . The majority states that the Sixth Amendment protects the right of a defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. Ante , at 3 . What the Sixth Amendment actually protects , however , is the right to have the assistance that the defendants counsel of choice is able to provide . It follows that if the erroneous disqualification of a defendants counsel of choice does not impair the assistance that a defendant receives at trial , there is no violation of the Sixth Amendment . 1	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
The language of the Sixth Amendment supports this interpretation . The Assistance of Counsel Clause focuses on what a defendant is entitled to receive ( Assistance ) , rather than on the identity of the provider . The background of the adoption of the Sixth Amendment points in the same direction . The specific evil against which the Assistance of Counsel Clause was aimed was the English common - law rule severely limiting a felony defendants ability to be assisted by counsel . United States v. Ash , 413 U. S. 300 , 306 ( 1973 ) . [T]he core purpose of the counsel guarantee was to assure Assistance at trial, i d . , at 309 , and thereby to assure fairness in the adversary criminal process, United States v. Morrison , 449 U. S. 361 , 364 ( 1981 ) . It was not the essential aim of the Amendment … to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be represented by the lawyer whom he prefers. Wheat v. United States , 486 U. S. 153 , 159 ( 1988 ) ; cf . Morris v. Slappy , 461 U. S. 1 , 14 ( 1983 ) ( [W]e reject the claim that the Sixth Amendment guarantees a meaningful relationship between an accused and his counsel ) .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
There is no doubt , of course , that the right to have the Assistance of Counsel carries with it a limited right to be represented by counsel of choice . At the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights , when the availability of appointed counsel was generally limited , 2 that is how the right inevitably played out : A defendants right to have the assistance of counsel necessarily meant the right to have the assistance of whatever counsel the defendant was able to secure . But from the beginning , the right to counsel of choice has been circumscribed .	@@empty@@	unmatched
For one thing , a defendants choice of counsel has always been restricted by the rules governing admission to practice before the court in question . The Judiciary Act of 1789 made this clear , providing that parties in all the courts of the United States had the right to the assistance of such counsel or attorneys at law as by the rules of the said courts respectively shall be permitted to manage and conduct cases therein. Ch . 20 , § 35 , 1Stat . 92 . Therefore , if a defendants first - choice attorney was not eligible to appear under the rules of a particular court , the defendant had no right to be represented by that attorney . Indeed , if a defendants top 10 or top 25 choices were all attorneys who were not eligible to appear in the court in question , the defendant had no right to be represented by any of them . Today , rules governing admission to practice before particular courts continue to limit the ability of a criminal defendant to be represented by counsel of choice . See Wheat , 486 U. S.,at159 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The right to counsel of choice is also limited by conflict- of - interest rules . Even if a defendant is aware that his or her attorney of choice has a conflict , and even if the defendant is eager to waive any objection , the defendant has no constitutional right to be represented by that attorney . See i d . , at 159160 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Similarly , the right to be represented by counsel of choice can be limited by mundane case - management considerations . If a trial judge schedules a trial to begin on a particular date and defendants counsel of choice is already committed for other trials until some time thereafter , the trial judge has discretion under appropriate circumstances to refuse to postpone the trial date and thereby , in effect , to force the defendant to forgo counsel of choice . See , e.g. , Slappy , supra ; United States v. Hughey , 147 F. 3d 423 , 428431 ( CA5 1998 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
These limitations on the right to counsel of choice are tolerable because the focus of the right is the quality of the representation that the defendant receives , not the identity of the attorney who provides the representation . Limiting a defendant to those attorneys who are willing , available , and eligible to represent the defendant still leaves a defendant with a pool of attorneys to choose fromand , in most jurisdictions today , a large and diverse pool . Thus , these restrictions generally have no adverse effect on a defendants ability to secure the best assistance that the defendants circumstances permit .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Because the Sixth Amendment focuses on the quality of the assistance that counsel of choice would have provided , I would hold that the erroneous disqualification of counsel does not violate the Sixth Amendment unless the ruling diminishes the quality of assistance that the defendant would have otherwise received . This would not require a defendant to show that the second - choice attorney was constitutionally ineffective within the meaning of Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 ( 1984 ) . Rather , the defendant would be entitled to a new trial if the defendant could show an identifiable difference in the quality of representation between the disqualified counsel and the attorney who represents the defendant at trial. Rodriguez v. Chandler , 382 F. 3d 670 , 675 ( CA7 2004 ) , cert . denied , 543 U. S. 1156 ( 2005 ) .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
This approach is fully consistent with our prior decisions . We have never held that the erroneous disqualification of counsel violates the Sixth Amendment when there is no prejudice , and while we have stated in several cases that the Sixth Amendment protects a defendants right to counsel of choice , see Caplin & Drysdale , Chartered v. United States , 491 U. S. 617 , 624625 ( 1989 ) ; Wheat , supra , at 159 ; Powell v. Alabama , 287 U. S. 45 , 53 ( 1932 ) , we had no occasion in those cases to consider whether a violation of this right can be shown where there is no prejudice . Nor do our opinions in those cases refer to that question . It is therefore unreasonable to read our general statements regarding counsel of choice as addressing the issue of prejudice . 3	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
But even accepting , as the majority holds , that the erroneous disqualification of counsel of choice always violates the Sixth Amendment , it still would not follow that reversal is required in all cases . The Constitution , by its terms , does not mandate any particular remedy for violations of its own provisions . Instead , we are bound in this case by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a ) , which instructs federal courts to disregar[d] [a]ny error … which does not affect substantial rights. See also 28 U. S. C. § 2111 ; Chapman v. California , 386 U. S. 18 , 22 ( 1967 ) . The only exceptions we have recognized to this rule have been for a limited class of fundamental constitutional errors that defy analysis by harmless error standards.  Neder v. United States , 527 U. S. 1 , 7 ( 1999 ) ( quoting Arizona v. Fulminante , 499 U. S. 279 , 309 ( 1991 ) ) ; see also Chapman , supra , at 23 . Such errors … necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair [ and ] deprive defendants of basic protections without which a criminal trial can not reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence … and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.  Neder , supra , at 89 ( quoting Rose v. Clark , 478 U. S. 570 , 577578 ( 1986 ) ( second omission in original ) ) ; see also ante , at 9 ( listing such errors ) .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
Thus , in Neder , we rejected the argument that the omission of an element of a crime in a jury instruction necessarily render[s ] a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence. 527 U. S. , at 9 . In fact , in that case , quite the opposite [ was ] true : Neder was tried before an impartial judge , under the correct standard of proof and with the assistance of counsel ; a fairly selected , impartial jury was instructed to consider all of the evidence and argument in respect to Neders defense . …  Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Neders situationwith an impartial judge , the correct standard of proof , assistance of counsel , and a fair juryis much like respondents . Fundamental unfairness does not inexorably follow from the denial of first - choice counsel . The decision to retain a particular lawyer is often uninformed, Cuyler v. Sullivan , 446 U. S. 335 , 344 ( 1980 ) ; a defendants second - choice lawyer may thus turn out to be better than the defendants first - choice lawyer . More often , a defendants first- and second - choice lawyers may be simply indistinguishable . These possibilities would not justify violating the right to choice of counsel , but they do make me hard put to characterize the violation as always render[ing ] a trial unfair, Neder , supra , at 9 . Fairness may not limit the right , see ante , at 5 , but it does inform the remedy .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Nor is it always or nearly always impossible to determine whether the first choice would have provided better representation than the second choice . There are undoubtedly cases in which the prosecution would have little difficulty showing that the second - choice attorney was better qualified than or at least as qualified as the defendants initial choice , and there are other cases in which it will be evident to the trial judge that any difference in ability or strategy could not have possibly affected the outcome of the trial .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Requiring a defendant to fall back on a second - choice attorney is not comparable to denying a defendant the right to be represented by counsel at all . Refusing to permit a defendant to receive the assistance of any counsel is the epitome of fundamental unfairness , and as far as the effect on the outcome is concerned , it is much more difficult to assess the effect of a complete denial of counsel than it is to assess the effect of merely preventing representation by the defendants first - choice attorney . To be sure , when the effect of an erroneous disqualification is hard to gauge , the prosecution will be unable to meet its burden of showing that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt . But that does not justify eliminating the possibility of showing harmless error in all cases .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The majoritys focus on the trial error/structural defect dichotomy is misleading . In Fulminante , we used these terms to denote two poles of constitutional error that had appeared in prior cases ; trial errors always lead to harmless - error review , while structural defects always lead to automatic reversal . See 499 U. S. , at 306310 . We did not suggest that trial errors are the only sorts of errors amenable to harmless - error review , or that all errors affecting the framework within which the trial proceeds, i d . , at 310 , are structural . The touchstone of structural error is fundamental unfairness and unreliability . Automatic reversal is strong medicine that should be reserved for constitutional errors that always or necessarily, Neder , supra , at 9 ( emphasis in original ) , produce such unfairness .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Either of the two courses outlined aboverequiring at least some showing of prejudice , or engaging in harmless - error reviewwould avoid the anomalous and unjustifiable consequences that follow from the majoritys two - part rule of error without prejudice followed by automatic reversal .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Under the majoritys holding , a defendant who is erroneously required to go to trial with a second - choice attorney is automatically entitled to a new trial even if this attorney performed brilliantly . By contrast , a defendant whose attorney was ineffective in the constitutional sense ( i.e. , made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed … by the Sixth Amendment, Strickland , 466 U. S. , at 687 ) can not obtain relief without showing prejudice .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
Under the majoritys holding , a trial court may adopt rules severely restricting pro hac vice admissions , cf . Leis v. Flynt , 439 U. S. 438 , 443 ( 1979 ) ( per curiam ) , but if it adopts a generous rule and then errs in interpreting or applying it , the error automatically requires reversal of any conviction , regardless of whether the erroneous ruling had any effect on the defendant .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Under the majoritys holding , some defendants will be awarded new trials even though it is clear that the erroneous disqualification of their first - choice counsel did not prejudice them in the least . Suppose , for example , that a defendant is initially represented by an attorney who previously represented the defendant in civil matters and who has little criminal experience . Suppose that this attorney is erroneously disqualified and that the defendant is then able to secure the services of a nationally acclaimed and highly experienced criminal defense attorney who secures a surprisingly favorable result at trialfor instance , acquittal on most but not all counts . Under the majoritys holding , the trial courts erroneous ruling automatically means that the Sixth Amendment was violatedeven if the defendant makes no attempt to argue that the disqualified attorney would have done a better job . In fact , the defendant would still be entitled to a new trial on the counts of conviction even if the defendant publicly proclaimed after the verdict that the second attorney had provided better representation than any other attorney in the country could have possibly done .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
Cases as stark as the above hypothetical are unlikely , but there are certainly cases in which the erroneous disqualification of a defendants first - choice counsel neither seriously upsets the defendants preferences nor impairs the defendants representation at trial . As noted above , a defendants second - choice lawyer may sometimes be better than the defendants first - choice lawyer . Defendants who retain counsel are frequently forced to choose among attorneys whom they do not know and about whom they have limited information , and thus a defendant may not have a strong preference for any one of the candidates . In addition , if all of the attorneys considered charge roughly comparable fees , they may also be roughly comparable in experience and ability . Under these circumstances , the erroneous disqualification of a defendants first - choice attorney may simply mean that the defendant will be represented by an attorney whom the defendant very nearly chose initially and who is able to provide representation that is just as good as that which would have been furnished by the disqualified attorney . In light of these realities , mandating reversal without even a minimal showing of prejudice on the part of the defendant is unwarranted .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The consequences of the majoritys holding are particularly severe in the federal system and in other court systems that do not allow a defendant to take an interlocutory appeal when counsel is disqualified . See Flanagan v. United States , 465 U. S. 259 , 260 ( 1984 ) . Under such systems , appellate review typically occurs after the defendant has been tried and convicted . At that point , if an appellate court concludes that the trial judge made a marginally incorrect ruling in applying its own pro hac vice rules , the appellate court has no alternative but to order a new trialeven if there is not even any claim of prejudice . The Sixth Amendment does not require such results .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
Because I believe that some showing of prejudice is required to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment , I would vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether there was prejudice . However , assuming for the sake of argument that no prejudice is required , I believe that such a violation , like most constitutional violations , is amenable to harmless - error review . Our statutes demand it , and our precedents do not bar it . I would then vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether the error was harmless in this case .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
The right to a fair trial , guaranteed to state criminal defendants by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment , imposes on States certain duties consistent with their sovereign obligation to ensure that justice shall be done  in all criminal prosecutions . United States v. Agurs , 427 U. S. 97 , 111 ( 1976 ) ( quoting Berger v. United States , 295 U. S. 78 , 88 ( 1935 ) ) . In Brady v. Maryland , 373 U. S. 83 ( 1963 ) , we held that when a State suppresses evidence favorable to an accused that is material to guilt or to punishment , the State violates the defendants right to due process , irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution. Id. , at 87 .	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each state , excluding Indians not taxed . But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state .

In this case , Gary Cone , a Vietnam veteran sentenced to death , contends that the State of Tennessee violated his right to due process by suppressing witness statements and police reports that would have corroborated his trial defense and bolstered his case in mitigation of the death penalty . At his trial in 1982 , Cone asserted an insanity defense , contending that he had killed two people while suffering from acute amphetamine psychosis , a disorder caused by drug addiction . The State of Tennessee discredited that defense , alleging that Cones drug addiction was baloney. Ten years later , Cone learned that the State had suppressed evidence supporting his claim of drug addiction .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Cone presented his new evidence to the state courts in a petition for postconviction relief , but the Tennessee courts denied him a hearing on the ground that his Brady claim had been previously determined, either on direct appeal from his conviction or in earlier collateral proceedings . On application for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 2254 , the Federal District Court concluded that the state courts disposition rested on an adequate and independent state ground that barred further review in federal court , and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit agreed . Doubt concerning the correctness of that holding , coupled with conflicting decisions from other Courts of Appeals , prompted our grant of certiorari .	@@empty@@	unmatched
After a complete review of the trial and postconviction proceedings , we conclude that the Tennessee courts rejection of petitioners Brady claim does not rest on a ground that bars federal review . Furthermore , although the District Court and the Court of Appeals passed briefly on the merits of Cones claim , neither court distinguished the materiality of the suppressed evidence with respect to Cones guilt from the materiality of the evidence with respect to his punishment . While we agree that the withheld documents were not material to the question whether Cone committed murder with the requisite mental state , the lower courts failed to adequately consider whether that same evidence was material to Cones sentence . Therefore , we vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the District Court to determine in the first instance whether there is a reasonable probability that the withheld evidence would have altered at least one jurors assessment of the appropriate penalty for Cones crimes .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On the afternoon of Saturday , August 10 , 1980 , Cone robbed a jewelry store in downtown Memphis , Tennessee . Fleeing the scene by car , he led police on a high - speed chase into a residential neighborhood . Once there , he abandoned his vehicle and shot a police officer . 1 When a bystander tried to impede his escape , Cone shot him , too , before escaping on foot .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A short time later , Cone tried to hijack a nearby car . When that attempt failed ( because the driver refused to surrender his keys ) , Cone tried to shoot the driver and a hovering police helicopter before realizing he had run out of ammunition . He then fled the scene . Although police conducted a thorough search , Cone was nowhere to be found .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Early the next morning , Cone reappeared in the same neighborhood at the door of an elderly woman . He asked to use her telephone , and when she refused , he drew a gun . Before he was able to gain entry , the woman slammed the door and called the police . By the time officers arrived , however , Cone had once again disappeared .	@@empty@@	unmatched
That afternoon , Cone gained entry to the home of 93-year - old Shipley Todd and his wife , 79-year - old Cleopatra Todd . Cone beat the couple to death with a blunt instrument and ransacked the first floor of their home . Later , he shaved his beard and escaped to the airport without being caught . Cone then traveled to Florida , where he was arrested several days later after robbing a drugstore in Pompano Beach .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A Tennessee grand jury charged Cone with two counts of first - degree murder , two counts of murder in the perpetration of a burglary , three counts of assault with intent to murder , and one count of robbery by use of deadly force . At his jury trial in 1982 , Cone did not challenge the overwhelming physical and testimonial evidence supporting the charges against him . His sole defense was that he was not guilty by reason of insanity .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Cones counsel portrayed his client as suffering from severe drug addiction attributable to trauma Cone had experienced in Vietnam . Counsel argued that Cone had committed his crimes while suffering from chronic amphetamine psychosis , a disorder brought about by his drug abuse . That defense was supported by the testimony of three witnesses . First was Cones mother , who described her son as an honorably discharged Vietnam veteran who had changed following his return from service . She recalled Cone describing how terrible it had been to handle the bodies of dead soldiers , and she explained that Cone slept restlessly and sometimes holler[ed] in his sleep . Tr . 16431645 ( Apr. 20 , 1982 ) . She also described one occasion , following Cones return from service , when a package was shipped to him that contained marijuana . Before the war , she asserted , Cone had not used drugs of any kind .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Two expert witnesses testified on Cones behalf . Matthew Jaremko , a clinical psychologist , testified that Cone suffered from substance abuse and posttraumatic stress disorders related to his military service in Vietnam . Jaremko testified that Cone had expressed remorse for the murders , and he opined that Cones mental disorder rendered him substantially incapable of conforming his conduct to the law . Jonathan Lipman , a neuropharmacologist , recounted at length Cones history of illicit drug use , which began after Cone joined the Army and escalated to the point where Cone was consuming rather horrific quantities of drugs daily . App . 100 . According to Lipman , Cones drug abuse had led to chronic amphetamine psychosis , a disorder manifested through hallucinations and ongoing paranoia that prevented Cone from obeying the law and appreciating the wrongfulness of his actions .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In rebutting Cones insanity defense the States strategy throughout trial was to present Cone as a calculating , intelligent criminal who was fully in control of his decisions and actions at the time of the crimes . A key component of that strategy involved discrediting Cones claims of drug use . 2 Through cross - examination , the State established that both defense experts opinions were based solely on Cones representations to them about his drug use rather than on any independently corroborated sources , such as medical records or interviews with family or friends . The prosecution also adduced expert and lay testimony to establish that Cone was not addicted to drugs and had acted rationally and intentionally before , during , and after the Todd murders .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Particularly damaging to Cones defense was the testimony of rebuttal witness Ilene Blankman , who had spent time with Cone several months before the murders and at whose home Cone had stayed in the days leading up to his arrest in Florida . Blankman admitted to being a former heroin addict but testified that she no longer used drugs and tried to stay away from people who did . She testified that she had never seen Cone use drugs , had never observed track marks on his body , and had never seen him exhibit signs of paranoia .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Emphasizing the States position with respect to Cones alleged addiction , the prosecutor told the jury during closing argument , [Y]oure not dealing with a crazy person , an insane man . A man … out of his mind . Youre dealing , I submit to you , with a premeditated , cool , deliberateand even cowardly , reallymurderer. Tr . 2084 ( Apr. 22 , 1982 ) . Pointing to the quantity of drugs found in Cones car , the prosecutor suggested that far from being a drug addict , Cone was actually a drug dealer . The prosecutor argued , Im not trying to be absurd , but he says hes a drug addict . I say baloney . Hes a drug seller . Doesnt the proof show that? Id. , at 107 . 3	@@empty@@	unmatched
The jury rejected Cones insanity defense and found him guilty on all counts . At the penalty hearing , the prosecution asked the jury to find that Cones crime met the criteria for four different statutory aggravating factors , any one of which would render him eligible for a capital sentence . 4 Cones counsel called no witnesses but instead rested on the evidence adduced during the guilt phase proceedings . Acknowledging that the prosecutions experts had disputed the existence of Cones alleged mental disorder , counsel nevertheless urged the jury to consider Cones drug addiction when weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors in the case . 5 The jury found all four aggravating factors and unanimously returned a sentence of death . 6	@@empty@@	unmatched
On direct appeal Cone raised numerous challenges to his conviction and sentence . Among those was a claim that the prosecution violated state law by failing to disclose a tape - recorded statement and police reports relating to several trial witnesses . See App . 114117 . The Tennessee Supreme Court rejected each of Cones claims , and affirmed his conviction and sentence . State v. Cone , 665 S. W. 2d 87 ( 1984 ) . 7 Cone then filed a petition for postconviction relief , primarily raising claims that his trial counsel had been ineffective ; the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the denial of that petition in 1987 . Cone v. State , 747 S. W. 2d 353 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In 1989 , Cone , acting pro se , filed a second petition for postconviction relief , raising myriad claims of error . Among these was a claim that the State had failed to disclose evidence in violation of his rights under the United States Constitution . At the States behest , the postconviction court summarily denied the petition , concluding that all the claims raised in it had either been previously determined or waived. Order Dismissing Petition for Post - Conviction Relief in Cone v. State , No . P06874 ( Crim . Ct . Shelby Cty . , Tenn. , Jan. 2 , 1990 ) . 8 At that time , the court did not specify which claims fell into which category .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Cone appealed the denial of his petition to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals , asserting that the postconviction court had erred by dismissing 13 claimshis Brady claim among themas previously determined when , in fact , they had not been previously addressed or determined by any court. Brief for Petitioner - Appellant Gary Bradford Cone in No . P06874 , pp . 2324 , and n. 11 . In addition Cone urged the court to remand the case to allow him , with the assistance of counsel , to rebut the presumption that he had waived any of his claims by not raising them at an earlier stage in the litigation . Id. , at 24 . 9 The court agreed and remanded the case for further proceedings .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On remand counsel was appointed and an amended petition was filed . The State once again urged the postconviction court to dismiss Cones petition . Apparently conflating the state - law disclosure claim Cone had raised on direct appeal with his newly filed Brady claim , the State represented that the Tennessee Supreme Court had already decided the Brady issue and that Cone was therefore barred from relitigating it . See App . 1516 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
While that petition remained pending before the postconviction court , the Tennessee Court of Appeals held for the first time that the States Public Records Act allowed a criminal defendant to review the prosecutors file in his case . See Capital Case Resource Center of Tenn. , Inc. v. Woodall , No . 01A019104CH00150 , 1992 WL 12217 ( Jan. 29 , 1992 ) . Based on that holding , Cone obtained access to the prosecutors files , in which he found proof that evidence had indeed been withheld from him at trial . Among the undisclosed documents Cone discovered were statements from witnesses who had seen him several days before and several days after the murders . The witnesses described Cones appearance as wild eyed, App . 50 , and his behavior as real weird, i d . , at 49 . One witness affirmed that Cone had appeared to be drunk or high. Ibid . The file also contained a police report describing Cones arrest in Florida following the murders . In that report , a police officer described Cone looking around in a frenzied manner, and walking in [ an ] agitated manner prior to his apprehension . Id. , at 53 .

With the newly discovered evidence in hand , Cone amended his postconviction petition once again in October 1993 , expanding his Brady claim to allege more specifically that the State had withheld exculpatory evidence demonstrating that he did in fact suffer drug problems and/or drug withdrawal or psychosis both at the time of the offense and in the past. App . at 20 . Cone pointed to specific examples of evidence that had been withheld , alleging the evidence was exculpatory to both the jurys determination of petitioners guilt and its consideration of the proper sentence, and that there was a reasonable probability that , had the evidence not been withheld , the jurors would not have convicted [ him ] and would not have sentenced him to death. Id. , at 2021.<footcall num="10 " > In a lengthy affidavit submitted with his amended petition , Cone explained that he had not raised his Brady claim in earlier proceedings because the facts underlying it ha[d ] been revealed through disclosure of the States files , which occurred after the first post - conviction proceeding. App . 18 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
After denying Cones request for an evidentiary hearing , the postconviction court denied relief on each claim presented in the amended petition . Many of the claims were dismissed on the ground that they had been waived by Cones failure to raise them in earlier proceedings ; however , consistent with the position urged by the State , the court dismissed many others , including the Brady claim , as mere re - statements of previous grounds heretofore determined and denied by the Tennessee Supreme Court upon Direct Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeals upon the First Petition. App . 22 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Noting that the findings of the trial court in post - conviction hearings are conclusive on appeal unless the evidence preponderates against the judgment, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed .

In 1997 , Cone filed a petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus . Without disclosing to the District Court the contrary position it had taken in the state - court proceedings , the State acknowledged that Cones Brady claim had not been raised prior to the filing of his second postconviction petition . However , wrenching out of context the state appellate courts holding that Cone had waived all claims … which had not been previously determined,  the State now asserted the Brady claim had been waived .

In May 1998 , the District Court denied Cones request for an evidentiary hearing on his Brady claim . Lamenting that its consideration of Cones claims had been made more difficult by the parties failure to articulate the state procedural rules under which each of Cones claims had allegedly been defaulted , App . to Pet . for Cert . 98a , the District Court nevertheless held that the Brady claim was procedurally barred . After parsing the claim into 11 separate subclaims based on 11 pieces of withheld evidence identified in the habeas petition , the District Court concluded that Cone had waived each subclaim by failing to present or adequately develop it in state court . App . to Pet . for Cert . 112a113a . Moreover , the court concluded that even if Cone had not defaulted his Brady claim , it would fail on its merits because none of the withheld evidence would have cast doubt on Cones guilt . App . to Pet . for Cert . 116a119a . Throughout its opinion the District Court repeatedly referenced factual allegations contained in early versions of Cones second petition for postconviction relief rather than the amended version of the petition upon which the state courts decision had rested .

After the District Court dismissed the remainder of Cones federal claims , the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted him permission to appeal several issues , including the alleged suppression of Brady material . Before the Court of Appeals , the State shifted its procedural default argument once more , this time contending that Cone had simply never raised his Brady claim in the state court because he failed to make adequate factual allegations to support that claim in his second petition for postconviction relief .

Repeating the District Courts error , the State directed the Court of Appeals attention to Cones pro se petition and to the petition Cones counsel filed before he gained access to the prosecutions case file .

Briefly mentioning several isolated pieces of suppressed evidence , the court summarily concluded that even if Cones Brady claim had not been defaulted , the suppressed evidence would not undermine confidence in the verdict ( and hence was not Brady material ) because of the overwhelming evidence of Cones guilt. 243 F. 3d , at 968 .

Following our second remand , the Court of Appeals revisited Cones Brady claim . This time , the court divided the claim into four separate subclaims : (1 ) evidence regarding [ Cones ] drug use ; ( 2 ) evidence that might have been useful to impeach the testimony and credibility of prosecution witness Sergeant Ralph Roby ; ( 3 ) FBI reports ; [ 11 ] and ( 4 ) evidence showing that prosecution witness Ilene Blankman was untruthful and biased. 492 F. 3d 743 , 753 ( 2007 ) . Noting that it had previously found all four subclaims to be procedurally defaulted , the court declined to reconsider its earlier decision . See ibid . ( citing Cone , 243 F. 3d , at 968970 ) . At the same time , the court reiterated that the withheld evidence would not have overcome the overwhelming evidence of Cones guilt in committing a brutal double murder and the persuasive testimony that Cone was not under the influence of drugs. 492 F. 3d , at 756 . Summarily discounting Cones contention that the withheld evidence was material with respect to his sentence , the court concluded that the introduction of the suppressed evidence would not have altered the jurors finding that Cones alleged drug use did not vitiate his specific intent to murder his victims and did not mitigate his culpability sufficient to avoid the death sentence. Id. , at 757 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Judge Merritt dissented .

During the state and federal proceedings below , the State of Tennessee offered two different justifications for denying review of the merits of Cones Brady claim . First , in connection with Cones amended petition for state postconviction relief , the State argued that the Brady claim was barred because it had been decided on direct appeal . See App . 1516 . Then , in connection with Cones federal habeas petition , the State argued that Cones claim was waived because it had never been properly raised before the state courts . See i d . , at 39 . The District Court and the Court of Appeals agreed that Cones claim was procedurally barred , but for different reasons . The District Court held that the claim had been waived , App . to Pet . for Cert . 102a , while the Court of Appeals held that the claim had been either waived or previously determined , Cone , 243 F. 3d , at 969 . We now conclude that neither prior determination nor waiver provides an independent and adequate state ground for denying Cone review of his federalclaim .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is well established that federal courts will not review questions of federal law presented in a habeas petition when the state courts decision rests upon a state - law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment. Coleman v. Thompson , 501 U. S. 722 , 729 ( 1991 ) ; Lee v. Kemna , 534 U. S. 362 , 375 ( 2002 ) . In the context of federal habeas proceedings , the independent and adequate state ground doctrine is designed to ensur[e ] that the States interest in correcting their own mistakes is respected in all federal habeas cases. Coleman , 501 U. S. , at 732 . When a petitioner fails to properly raise his federal claims in state court , he deprives the State of an opportunity to address those claims in the first instance and frustrates the States ability to honor his constitutional rights . Id. , at 732 , 748 . Therefore , consistent with the longstanding requirement that habeas petitioners must exhaust available state remedies before seeking relief in federal court , we have held that when a petitioner fails to raise his federal claims in compliance with relevant state procedural rules , the state courts refusal to adjudicate the claim ordinarily qualifies as an independent and adequate state ground for denying federal review . See i d . , at 731 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
That does not mean , however , that federal habeas review is barred every time a state court invokes a procedural rule to limit its review of a state prisoners claims . We have recognized that  the adequacy of state procedural bars to the assertion of federal questions … is not within the States prerogative finally to decide ; rather , adequacy is itself a federal question.  Lee , 534 U. S. , at 375 ( quoting Douglas v. Alabama , 380 U. S. 415 , 422 ( 1965 ) ) ; see also Coleman , 501 U. S. , at 736 ( [F]ederal habeas courts must ascertain for themselves if the petitioner is in custody pursuant to a state court judgment that rests on independent and adequate state grounds ) . The question before us now is whether federal review of Cones Brady claim is procedurally barred either because the claim was twice presented to the state courts or because it was waived , and thus not presented at all .	@@empty@@	unmatched
First , we address the contention that the repeated presentation of a claim in state court bars later federal review . The Tennessee postconviction court denied Cones Brady claim after concluding it had been previously determined following a full and fair hearing in state court . See Tenn. Code Ann . § 4030112(a ) ( 1982 ) . That conclusion rested on a false premise : Contrary to the state courts finding , Cone had not presented his Brady claim in earlier proceedings and , consequently , the state courts had not passed on it . The Sixth Circuit recognized that Cones Brady claim had not been decided on direct appeal , see Cone , 243 F. 3d , at 969 , but felt constrained by the state courts refusal to reach the merits of that claim on postconviction review . The Court of Appeals concluded that because the state postconviction courts had applied a state procedural law to avoid reaching the merits of Cones Brady claim , an independent and adequate state ground barred federal habeas review . 243 F. 3d , at 969 . In this Court the State does not defend that aspect of the Court of Appeals holding , and rightly so .	@@empty@@	unmatched
When a state court declines to review the merits of a petitioners claim on the ground that it has done so already , it creates no bar to federal habeas review . In Ylst v. Nunnemaker , 501 U. S. 797 , 804 , n. 3 ( 1991 ) , we observed in passing that when a state court declines to revisit a claim it has already adjudicated , the effect of the later decision upon the availability of federal habeas is nil because a later state decision based upon ineligibility for further state review neither rests upon procedural default nor lifts a pre - existing procedural default. 12 When a state court refuses to readjudicate a claim on the ground that it has been previously determined , the courts decision does not indicate that the claim has been procedurally defaulted . To the contrary , it provides strong evidence that the claim has already been given full consideration by the state courts and thus is ripe for federal adjudication . See 28 U. S. C. § 2254(b)(1)(A ) ( permitting issuance of a writ of habeas corpus only after the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A claim is procedurally barred when it has not been fairly presented to the state courts for their initial considerationnot when the claim has been presented more than once . Accordingly , insofar as the Court of Appeals rejected Cones Brady claim as procedurally defaulted because the claim had been twice presented to the Tennessee courts , its decision was erroneous .	@@empty@@	unmatched
As an alternative ( and contradictory ) ground for barring review of Cones Brady claim , the State has argued that Cones claim was properly dismissed by the state postconviction court on the ground it had been waived . We are not persuaded . The state appellate court affirmed the denial of Cones Brady claim on the same mistaken ground offered by the lower courtthat the claim had been previously determined . 13 Contrary to the States assertion , the Tennessee appellate court did not hold that Cones Brady claim was waived .	@@empty@@	unmatched
When a state court declines to find that a claim has been waived by a petitioners alleged failure to comply with state procedural rules , our respect for the state - court judgment counsels us to do the same . Although we have an independent duty to scrutinize the application of state rules that bar our review of federal claims , Lee , 534 U. S. , at 375 , we have no concomitant duty to apply state procedural bars where state courts have themselves declined to do so . The Tennessee courts did not hold that Cone waived his Brady claim , and we will not second - guess their judgment . 14	@@empty@@	unmatched
The States procedural objections to federal review of the merits of Cones claim have resulted in a significant delay in bringing this unusually protracted case to a conclusion . Ultimately , however , they provide no obstacle to judicial review . Cone properly preserved and exhausted his Brady claim in the state court ; therefore , it is not defaulted . We turn now to the merits of that claim .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Although the State is obliged to prosecute with earnestness and vigor, it is as much [ its ] duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one. Berger , 295 U. S. , at 88 . Accordingly , we have held that when the State withholds from a criminal defendant evidence that is material to his guilt or punishment , it violates his right to due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment . See Brady , 373 U. S. , at 87 . In United States v. Bagley , 473 U. S. 667 , 682 ( 1985 ) ( opinion of Blackmun , J. ) , we explained that evidence is material within the meaning of Brady when there is a reasonable probability that , had the evidence been disclosed , the result of the proceeding would have been different . In other words , favorable evidence is subject to constitutionally mandated disclosure when it could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict. Kyles v. Whitley , 514 U. S. 419 , 435 ( 1995 ) ; accord , Banks v. Dretke , 540 U. S. 668 , 698699 ( 2004 ) ; Strickler v. Greene , 527 U.

The documents suppressed by the State vary in kind , but they share a common feature : Each strengthens the inference that Cone was impaired by his use of drugs around the time his crimes were committed . The suppressed evidence includes statements by witnesses acknowledging that Cone appeared to be drunk or high, App . 49 , acted real weird, ibid . , and looked wild eyed, i d . , at 50 , in the two days preceding the murders . 16 It also includes documents that could have been used to impeach witnesses whose trial testimony cast doubt on Cones drug addiction . For example , Memphis police officer Ralph Roby testified at trial that Cone had no needle marks on his body when he was arrestedan observation that bolstered the States argument that Cone was not a drug user . The suppressed evidence reveals , however , that Roby authorized multiple teletypes to law enforcement agencies in the days following the murders in which he described Cone as a drug user and a heavy drug user. See i d . , at 5558 . 17 A suppressed statement made by the chief of police of Cones hometown also describes Cone as a serious drug user . See Cone , 243 F. 3d , at 968 . And undisclosed notes of a police interview with Ilene Blankman conducted several days after the murders reveal discrepancies between her initial statement and her trial testimony relevant to Cones alleged drug use . App . 7273 . In sum , both the quantity and the quality of the suppressed evidence lends support to Cones position at trial that he habitually used excessive amounts of drugs , that his addiction affected his behavior during his crime spree , and that the States arguments to the contrary were false and misleading .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Thus , the federal question that must be decided is whether the suppression of that probative evidence deprived Cone of his right to a fair trial . See Agurs , 427 U. S. , at 108 . Because the Tennessee courts did not reach the merits of Cones Brady claim , federal habeas review is not subject to the deferential standard that applies under AEDPA to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings. 28 U. S. C. § 2254(d ) . Instead , the claim is reviewed de novo . See , e.g. , Rompilla v. Beard , 545 U. S. 374 , 390 ( 2005 ) ( de novo review where state courts did not reach prejudice prong under Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 ( 1984 ) ) ; Wiggins v. Smith , 539 U. S. 510 , 534 ( 2003 ) ( same ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Contending that the Federal District Court and Court of Appeals adequately and correctly resolved the merits of that claim , the State urges us to affirm the Sixth Circuits denial of habeas relief . In assessing the materiality of the evidence suppressed by the State , the Court of Appeals suggested that two facts outweighed the potential force of the suppressed evidence . First , the evidence of Cones guilt was overwhelming . Second , the evidence of Cones drug use was cumulative because the jury had heard evidence of Cones alleged addiction from witnesses and from officers who interviewed Cone and recovered drugs from his vehicle . 18 The Court of Appeals did not thoroughly review the suppressed evidence or consider what its cumulative effect on the jury would have been . Moreover , in concluding that the suppressed evidence was not material within the meaning of Brady , the court did not distinguish between the materiality of the evidence with respect to guilt and the materiality of the evidence with respect to punishmentan omission we find significant .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Evidence that is material to guilt will often be material for sentencing purposes as well ; the converse is not always true , however , as Brady itself demonstrates . In our seminal case on the disclosure of prosecutorial evidence , defendant John Brady was indicted for robbery and capital murder . At trial , Brady took the stand and confessed to robbing the victim and being present at the murder but testified that his accomplice had actually strangled the victim . Brady v. State , 226 Md. 422 , 425 , 174 A. 2d 167 , 168 ( 1961 ) . After Brady was convicted and sentenced to death he discovered that the State had suppressed the confession of his accomplice , which included incriminating statements consistent with Bradys version of events . Id. , at 426 , 174 A. 2d , at 169 . The Maryland Court of Appeals concluded that Bradys due process rights were violated by the suppression of the accomplices confession but declined to order a new trial on guilt . Observing that nothing in the accomplices confession could have reduced … Bradys offense below murder in the first degree, the state court ordered a new trial on the question of punishment only . Id. , at 430 , 174 A. 2d , at 171 . We granted certiorari and affirmed , rejecting Bradys contention that the state courts limited remand violated his constitutional rights . 373 U. S. , at 88 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
As in Brady , the distinction between the materiality of the suppressed evidence with respect to guilt and punishment is significant in this case . During the guilt phase of Cones trial , the only dispute was whether Cone was sane under the law, Tr . 2040 ( Apr. 22 , 1982 ) , as his counsel described the issue , or criminally responsible for his conduct , App . 110 , as the prosecutor argued . Under Tennessee law , Cone could not be held criminally responsible for the murders if , at the time of [ his ] conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lack[ed ] substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. Graham v. State , 547 S. W. 2d 531 , 543 ( Tenn. 1977 ) . Although we take exception to the Court of Appeals failure to assess the effect of the suppressed evidence collectively rather than item by item, see Kyles , 514 U. S. , at 436 , we nevertheless agree that even when viewed in the light most favorable to Cone , the evidence falls short of being sufficient to sustain his insanity defense .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Cones experts testified that his drug addiction and posttraumatic stress disorder originated during his service in Vietnam , more than 13 years before the Todds were murdered . During those years , despite Cones drug use and mental disorder , he managed to successfully complete his education , travel , and ( when not incarcerated ) function in civil society . The suppressed evidence may have strengthened the inference that Cone was on drugs or suffering from withdrawal at the time of the murders , but his behavior before , during , and after the crimes was inconsistent with the contention that he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law . See Graham , 547 S. W. 2d , at 543 . The likelihood that the suppressed evidence would have affected the jurys verdict on the issue of insanity is therefore remote . Accordingly , we conclude that the Sixth Circuit did not err by denying habeas relief on the ground that the suppressed evidence was immaterial to the jurys finding of guilt .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The same can not be said of the Court of Appeals summary treatment of Cones claim that the suppressed evidence influenced the jurys sentencing recommendation . There is a critical difference between the high standard Cone was required to satisfy to establish insanity as a matter of Tennessee law and the far lesser standard that a defendant must satisfy to qualify evidence as mitigating in a penalty hearing in a capital case . See Bell , 535 U. S. , at 712 ( Stevens , J. , dissenting ) ( [T]here is a vast difference between insanitywhich the defense utterly failed to proveand the possible mitigating effect of drug addiction incurred as a result of honorable service in the military ) . As defense counsel emphasized in his brief opening statement during penalty phase proceedings , the jury was statutorily required to consider whether Cones capacity … to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired as a result of mental disease or defect or intoxication which was insufficient to establish a defense to the crime but which substantially affected his judgment. Tenn. Code Ann . § 392203(j)(8 ) ( 1982 ) . It is possible that the suppressed evidence , viewed cumulatively , may have persuaded the jury that Cone had a far more serious drug problem than the prosecution was prepared to acknowledge , and that Cones drug use played a mitigating , though not exculpating , role in the crimes he committed . 19 The evidence might also have rebutted the States suggestion that Cone had manipulated his expert witnesses into falsely believing he was a drug addict when in fact he did not struggle with substance abuse .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Neither the Court of Appeals nor the District Court fully considered whether the suppressed evidence might have persuaded one or more jurors that Cones drug addictionespecially if attributable to honorable service of his country in Vietnamwas sufficiently serious to justify a decision to imprison him for life rather than sentence him to death . Because the evidence suppressed at Cones trial may well have been material to the jurys assessment of the proper punishment in this case , we conclude that a full review of the suppressed evidence and its effect is warranted .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In the 27 years since Gary Cone was convicted of murder and sentenced to death , no Tennessee court has reached the merits of his claim that state prosecutors withheld evidence that would have bolstered his defense and rebutted the States attempts to cast doubt on his alleged drug addiction . Today we hold that the Tennessee courts procedural rejection of Cones Brady claim does not bar federal habeas review of the merits of that claim . Although we conclude that the suppressed evidence was not material to Cones conviction for first - degree murder , the lower courts erred in failing to assess the cumulative effect of the suppressed evidence with respect to Cones capital sentence . Accordingly , the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated , and the case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to give full consideration to the merits of Cones Brady claim .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court affirms Gary Cones conviction for beating an elderly couple to death with a blunt object . In so doing , the majority correctly rejects Cones argument that his guilty verdict was secured in violation of his rights under Brady v. Maryland , 373 U. S. 83 ( 1963 ) . The majority declines , however , to decide whether the same evidence that was insufficient under Brady to overturn his conviction provides a basis for overturning his death sentence . The majority instead remands this question to the District Court for further consideration because it finds that the Court of Appeals engaged in a summary treatment of Cones Brady sentencing claim . See ante , at 2527 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
I respectfully dissent . The Court of Appeals allegedly summary treatment of Cones sentencing claim does not justify a remand to the District Court . Cone has failed to establish  a reasonable probability that , had the evidence been disclosed to the defense , the result of the [ sentencing ] proceeding would have been different,  Kyles v. Whitley , 514 U. S. 419 , 435 ( 1995 ) ( quoting United States v. Bagley , 473 U. S. 667 , 682 ( 1985 ) ( opinion of Blackmun , J. ) ) . As a result , I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals . 1	@@empty@@	unmatched
This case arises from a crime spree 28 years ago that began with Cones robbery of a jewelry store in Memphis , Tennessee , and concluded with his robbery of a drugstore in Pompano Beach , Florida . Along the way , Cone shot a police officer and a bystander while trying to escape the first robbery , attempted to shoot another man in a failed carjacking attempt , unsuccessfully tried to force his way into a womans apartment at gunpoint , and murdered 93-year - old Shipley Todd and his 79-year - old wife , Cleopatra . When he was tried on two counts of first - degree murder in 1982 , Cones sole defense was that he did not have the requisite intent to commit first - degree murder becausehe was in the grip of a chronic amphetamine psychosis . The jury rejected the defense and convicted Cone of both murders .	@@empty@@	unmatched
At sentencing , the Tennessee jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that four statutory aggravating factors applied to Cones offense : ( 1 ) Cone had been convicted of one or more previous felonies involving the use or threat of violence ; ( 2 ) he had knowingly created a great risk of death to two or more persons other than the victim during his act of murder ; ( 3 ) the murder was especially heinous , atrocious or cruel in that it involved torture or depravity of mind ; and ( 4 ) the murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding a lawful arrest . Tr . 21512152 ( Apr. 23 , 1982 ) ; see also State v. Cone , 665 S. W. 2d 87 , 9496 ( Tenn. 1984 ) . Tenn. Code Ann . § 392 - 203(i ) ( 1982 ) . 2 Cone argued to the jury at sentencing that his capacity … to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired as a result of mental disease or defect or intoxication which was insufficient to establish a defense to the crime but which substantially affected his judgment. See § 392 - 203(j)(8 ) . But the jury found that neither this , nor any other mitigating factor , outweighed the aggravating factors . The jury , as required by Tennessee law , unanimously sentenced Cone to death . See § 392 - 203(g ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
For almost three decades , Cones case has traveled through the Tennessee and federal courts . This Court has twice reversed decisions from the Court of Appeals that invalidated Cones conviction and sentence . See Bell v. Cone , 535 U. S. 685 ( 2002 ) ; Bell v. Cone , 543 U. S. 447 ( 2005 ) ( per curiam ) . On remand from this Courts latest decision , the Court of Appeals directly considered whether a handful of police reports , law enforcement bulletins , and notes that were allegedly withheld from Cones trial attorneys could have changed the result of Cones trial or sentencing . And , for the second time , the Court of Appeals held that there was not a  reasonable probability  that the evidence would have altered the jurys conclusion that Cones prior drug use did not vitiate his specific intent to murder his victims and did not mitigate his culpability sufficient to avoid the death sentence. 492 F. 3d 743 , 757 ( CA6 2007 ) . The Court of Appeals , therefore , held that neither Cones conviction nor his sentence was invalid . See ibid . ; Cone v. Bell , 243 F. 3d 961 , 968 ( CA6 2001 ) . We should affirm the Court of Appeals and put an end to this litigation .	@@empty@@	unmatched
According to the majority , the Court of Appeals decision affirming Cones death sentence is too summary, ante , at 25,and the facts are such that , on further examination , Cone might be able to demonstrate that it is possible that the contested evidence would have persuaded the jury to spare his life , ante , at 2526 . On this reasoning , the majority remands the case directly to the District Court for full consideration [ of ] the merits of Cones [ sentencing ] claim. Ante , at 27.I disagree on all counts . Remanding the sentencing issue to the District Court is an unusual step for this Court to take . House v. Bell , 547 U. S. 518 , 557 ( 2006 ) ( Roberts , C. J. , concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part ) . Furthermore , in this case , it is a step that is legally and factually unjustified . There is not  a reasonable probability that , had the evidence been disclosed to the defense , the result of the proceeding would have been different.  Kyles , 514 U. S. , at 433434 ( quoting Bagley , 473 U. S. , at 682 ( opinion of Blackmun , J. ) ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The majoritys criticism of the Court of Appeals allegedly summary treatment of the sentencing question is misplaced . Before the Court of Appeals , Cone dedicated eight pages of his opening brief to arguing that the implicated evidence was material to his guilt or innocence , but spent only one paragraph arguing its materiality to his death sentence . See Brief for Appellant in No . 995279 ( CA6 ) , pp . 4048 . The Court of Appeals focus on the guilt phase , rather than the sentencing phase , simply followed Cones lead . See 492 F. 3d , at 755 ( In his most recent brief , claiming that his receiving the withheld evidence would have resulted in a different sentence , Cone has made only conclusory arguments ) . 3 There is nothing defective about a judicial decision that summarily rejects an abbreviated legal argument , especially where , as here , the burden of proving the materiality of the contested evidence was on Cone . 4	@@empty@@	unmatched
In remanding this matter to the District Court , the majority makes two critical errorsone legal and one factualthat leave the false impression that Cones Brady claim has a chance of success . First , the majority states that [i]t is possible that the suppressed evidence may have convinced the jury that Cones substance abuse played a mitigating role in his crime and [t]he evidence might also have rebutted the States suggestion that Cones experts were inaccurately depicting the depth of his drug - induced impairment . Ante , at 26 ( emphasis added ) ; see also ante , at 2627(remanding [b]ecause the evidence suppressed at Cones trial may well have been material to the jurys assessment of the proper punishment in this case ( emphasis added ) ) . But , as the majority implicitly acknowledges , see ante , at 26 , n. 19 , this is not the correct legal test for evaluating a Brady claim : The mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense , or might have affected the outcome of the trial , does not establish materiality in the constitutional sense. United States v. Agurs , 427 U. S. 97 , 109110 ( 1976 ) ( emphasis added ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Rather , this Court has made clear that the legal standard for adjudicating such a claim is whether there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have been persuaded by the allegedly withheld evidence . Kyles , supra , at 435 ; Bagley , supra , at 682 ( opinion of Blackmun , J. ) . It simply is not sufficient , therefore , to claim that there is a reasonable possibility that … testimony might have produced a different result … . [ P]etitioners burden is to establish a reasonable probability of a different result. Strickler v. Greene , 527 U. S. 263 , 291 ( 1999 ) ( emphasis in original ) . To satisfy the reasonable probability standard , Cone must show that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the jurys sentencing determination . Kyles , supra , at 435 . The Court must view the record as a whole, Sawyer v. Whitley , 505 U. S. 333 , 374 ( 1992 ) ( Stevens , J. , concurring in judgment ) , and determine whether the absence of the disclosure prevented Cone from receiving  a trial resulting in a [ sentence ] worthy of confidence.  Strickler , supra , at 290 ( quoting Kyles , 514 U. S. , at 434 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In the context of this case , for Cone to establish  a reasonable probability that , had the evidence been disclosed to the defense , the result of the [ sentencing ] proceeding would have been different,  i d . , at 435 , he must not only demonstrate that the withheld evidence would have established that he was substantially impaired as a result of drug abuse or withdrawal ; Cone also must establish that the addition of the allegedly withheld evidence ultimately would have led the jury to conclude that any mitigating factors ( including substantial impairment ) outweighed all of the established aggravating factors . See Tenn. Code Ann . § 392 - 203(g ) . 5	@@empty@@	unmatched
Second , the majority incorrectly claims that to prevail on his Brady claim , Cone must demonstrate simply that the withheld evidence supported the inference that he was impaired by his use of drugs around the time his crimes were committed. See ante , at 21 . This is factually inaccurate because there was already significant evidence of Cones drug use at trial . To establish that the allegedly withheld evidence would reasonably have had any impact on his case , Cone must instead show that the evidence would have supported his claim of substantial mental impairment from drug use .	@@empty@@	unmatched
There was extensive evidence at trial that supported the inference that Cone was not only a longstanding drug user , but that he was in fact using drugs at the time of his crimes . The State itself presented significant evidence on this point . For example , it presented proof that officers found marijuana cigarette butts , empty drug vials , and loose syringes in the car that Cone abandoned immediately after the jewelry store robbery . Tr.15051509 ( Apr. 19 , 1982 ) . The State also did not challenge testimony from Cones mother that Cone used drugs . Id. , at 1647 , 16481653 ( Apr. 20 , 1982 ) . And , most tellingly , the State introduced evidence that Cone was abusing three drugscocaine , Dilaudid , and Demerolat the time of his arrest and was suffering slight withdrawal symptoms from them . Id.,at 19151916 , 1920 ( Apr. 22 , 1982 ) . As the Court of Appeals explained , [i]t would not have been news to the jurors , that Cone was a drug user.  492 F. 3d , at 757 . 6	@@empty@@	unmatched
In contrast , what was contested by the State during trial was Cones defense that his drug use was so significant that it caused him to suffer from extreme amphetamine psychosis at the time of the murders . One of Cones expert witnesses , a neuropharmacologist , testified that by the summer of 1980 , when the crimes occurred , Cone was ingesting ferociously large doses of drugs and that his increasing tolerance and use of amphetamines caused a chronic amphetamine psychosis . Tr . 17361737 , 17441747 , 17581759 ( Apr. 21 , 1982 ) . The expert further testified that if a person with chronic amphetamine psychosis were to go into withdrawal , he could suffer extreme mood swings , a crashing depression, and a state of weakness so severe that he could barely lift himself. Id. , at 18571859 . In this experts view , these symptoms could cause a person to lose his mind. Id. , at 1859 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The State contradicted that testimony with significant evidence that Cone did not act like someone who was out of his mind during the commission of his crimes . Rather , the State argued , Cone behaved rationally during his initial Tennessee robbery , his subsequent escape , his flight from Tennessee to Florida after the Todd murders , his Florida robbery , and his subsequent arrest . See , e.g. , i d . , at 20742084 ( Apr. 22 , 1982 ) . To substantiate this argument , the State called FBI Special Agent Eugene Flynn to the stand . Agent Flynn testified that , when captured , Cone coherently detailed his travel from Tennessee to Florida , explained his efforts to evade detection by shaving his beard and buying new clothes , and initiated negotiations for a plea bargain . Id. , at 19181921 . The State also presented testimony from a friend of Cones , Ilene Blankman , that she saw no indication that Cone was under the influence of drugs or severe withdrawal in the days immediately following the murder of the Todds . Id. , at 18751876 , 18821883 ( Apr. 21 , 1982 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Viewing the record as a whole , then , it is apparent that the contested issue at trial and sentencing was not whether Cone used drugs , but rather the quantityof Cones drug use and its effect on his mental state . Only if the evidence allegedly withheld from Cone was relevant to this question whether Cone suffered from extreme amphetamine psychosis or other substantial impairment would the evidence have been exculpatory for purposes of Brady . See Order Denying Motion for Evidentiary Hearing and Order of Partial Dismissal , Cone v. Bell , No . 972312M1/A ( WD Tenn. , May 15 , 1998 ) , App . to Pet . for Cert . 119a , n. 9 ( explaining that the issue at trial was not whether Cone had ever abused any drugs ( he clearly had ) , but whether he was out of his mind on amphetamines at the time of the murders ) ; Tr . 21152116 ( Apr. 23 , 1982 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
With the legal and factual issues correctly framed , it becomes clear that Cone can not establish a reasonable probability that admission of the evidenceviewed either individually or cumulativelywould have caused the jury to alter his sentence .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Cone first argues that he was improperly denied police reports that included witness statements regarding Cones behavior around the time of his crime spree . The first statement was given by a convenience store employee , Robert McKinney , who saw Cone the day before he robbed the Tennessee jewelry store . When asked whether Cone appeared to be drunk or high on anything, McKinney answered , [w]ell he did , he acted real weird … he just wandered around the store. App . 49 . But McKinney subsequently clarified that Cone didnt sound drunk and that the reason Cone attracted his attention was because he wasnt acting like a regular customer ; he was just kinda wandering around the store . Motion to Expand the Record in No . 972312M1 ( WD Tenn. ) , Exh . 2 , pp . 3 , 4 . Contrary to the majoritys assertion , this interview is not convincing evidence that Cone appeared to be drunk or high  when McKinney saw him . Ante , at 21 . McKinneys clarification that he had characterized Cones behavior as weird because Cone appeared to be killing time rather than acting like a normal shopper undermines the implication of McKinneys earlier statement that Cone looked weird because he might have been drunk or on drugs . Thus , there is little chance that McKinneys statement would have provided any significant additional evidence that Cone was using drugs , let alone provide sentence - changing evidence that he was substantially impaired due to amphetamine psychosis .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The second statement was given by Charles and Debbie Slaughter , who both witnessed Cone fleeing from police after the jewelry store robbery and reportedly told police that he looked wild eyed. App . 50 . Cone had just robbed a jewelry store , shot a police officer and a bystander , and was still fleeing from police when seen by the Slaughters . It is thus unlikely that their observation of a wild eyed man would have been interpreted by the jury to mean that Cone was suffering from chronic amphetamine psychosis at the time of the crimes, ante , at 21 , n. 16 , rather than to mean that Cone looked like a man on the run .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The third statement is contained in a police report authored by an officer who helped apprehend Cone after the Florida drugstore robbery . He reported that he saw a suspect at the rear of Sambos restaurant . Subject was observed to be looking about in a frenzied manner and also appeared to be looking for a place to run. App . 53 . Nothing in this police report either connects Cone to drug use or appears otherwise capable of altering the jurys understanding of Cones mental state at the time of the crimes . It certainly makes perfect sense that Cone was looking about in a frenzied manner, ibid . ; he had just robbed a drugstore and was about to engage in a gun battle with police in order to evade arrest . The police officers description of Cones appearance under these circumstances thus does not undermine confidence in Cones sentence . Kyles , 514 U. S. , at 435 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The next category of documents that Cone relies upon to establish his Brady claim are police bulletins . Some of the bulletins were sent by Memphis Police Sergeant Roby to neighboring jurisdictions on the day of the Todd murders and the day after . The bulletins sought Cones apprehension and alternatively described him as a drug user or a heavy drug user. App . 5558 . Cone asserts that he could have used these bulletins to impeach Sergeant Robys trial testimony that the sergeant did not see any track marks when visiting Cone in jail a week later . Tr . 1939 ( Apr. 22 , 1982 ) . Cones reasoning is faulty for two key reasons . First , Sergeant Roby never testified that Cone was nota drug user . His only trial testimony on this point was simply that he observed no needle marks on Cones arm when taking hair samples from him a few days after Cones apprehension . Ibid . Second , the bulletins establish only that the police were initially cautious regarding the characteristics of a person who had committed several heinous crimes. App . to Pet . for Cert . 119a , n. 9 . The bulletins would not have tended to prove that the fugitive Cone was , in fact , a heavy drug userlet alone out of his mind or otherwise substantially impaired due to amphetamine psychosisat the time of his crimes . 7	@@empty@@	unmatched
Cone also argues that material was withheld that could have been used to impeach Ilene Blankmans testimony that Cone did not appear to be high or in withdrawal when she helped him obtain a Florida drivers license during his efforts to evade arrest in Florida . Tr . 18751882 ( Apr. 21 , 1982 ) . But he again fails to meet the standard for exculpatory evidence set by Brady .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Cone first points to police notes of a pre - trial interview with Blankman , which did not reflect the statement she gave at trial that she saw no track marks on Cones arm . App . 7273 . But Blankman was questioned at trial about her failure to initially disclose this fact to police , Tr . 1903 ( Apr. 21 , 1982 ) , so the jury was fully aware of the omission . Disclosure of the original copy of the police notes thus could not have had any material effect on the jurys deliberations . Moreover , the missing notes also recorded a damning statement by Blankman that Cone never used drugs around her and she never saw Cone with drug paraphernalia. App . 73 . Thus , it is difficult to accept Cones argument that he would have benefited from the introduction of notes from Blackmans pretrial interview . If anything , these police notes would have undermined his mitigation argument .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Cone next relies on a report that describes a womans confrontation with the prosecution team and Blankman at a restaurant during trial . During the encounter , the woman accused Blankman of lying on the stand in order to frame Cone for the murders . Id. , at 7475 . The report indicates that the prosecutors politely declined the womans numerous attempts to discuss the merits of the case and that Blankman said nothing . Id. , at 75 . Nothing about this encounter raises doubts about Blankmans credibility .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Last , Cone points to correspondence in the district attorneys files suggest[ing ] that the prosecution had been unusually solicitous of [ Blankmans ] testimony. Brief for Petitioner 45 . But the correspondence was completely innocuous . One of the notes , sent in response to Blankmans request for a copy of her prior statement , expressed to Blankman that her cooperation in this particular matter is appreciated. App . 76 . The prosecutor then sent a letter to confirm that Blankman would testify at trial . Id. , at 77 . And finally , after trial , the prosecutor sent a note to inform Blankman of the verdict and indicate that they certainly appreciate[d ] [ her ] cooperation with [ them ] in the trial of Gary Bradford Cone. Id. , at 78 . There is nothing about these notes that tend[s ] to prove any fact that is both favorable to Cone and material to his guilt or punishment. App . to Pet . for Cert . 116a .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Viewing the record as a whole , Cone has not come close to demonstrating that there is a reasonable probability that the withheld evidence , analyzed individually or cumulatively , would have changed the result of his sentencing . Much of the impeachment evidence identified by Cone is of no probative value whatsoever . The police bulletins do not contradict any of the trial testimony ; the restaurant encounter was innocuous ; and the correspondence sent by prosecutors to Blankman does not undermine her testimony or call Cones mental state into doubt . If the remaining evidence has any value to Cone , it is marginal at best . There was testimony that Blankman did not initially tell police that Cone lacked track marks . See Tr . 1903 ( Apr. 21 , 1982 ) . McKinney clarified in his statement that Cones activity in the store was consistent with a person killing time , not the use of drugs or alcohol . And the behavior described by the Slaughters and the Florida police officer is more naturally attributable to the circumstances of Cones flight from the police than to any inference that Cone was out of his mind or otherwise substantially impaired due to amphetamine psychosis .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Countering the trivial value of the alleged Brady material is the clear and overwhelming evidence that during Cones crime spree , he was neither sufficiently insane to avoid a conviction of murder nor substantially impaired by his drug use or withdrawal - related psychosis . There was substantial evidence that Cone carefully planned the jewelry store robbery and was calm in carrying it out , Tr . at 974976 , 1014 ( Apr. 16 , 1982 ) , 13501352 ( Apr. 17 , 1982 ) , 1501 ( Apr. 19 , 1982 ) , 2075 ( Apr. 22 , 1982 ) ; that he successfully eluded police after engaging them in a shootout , i d . , at 10531064 ( Apr. 16 , 1982 ) ; that , after hiding overnight , he concocted a ruse to try to gain illegal entry to a residence , i d . , at 12051208 ( Apr. 17 , 1982 ) ; that he murdered the Todds after they declined to cooperate with his efforts to further elude police , i d . , at 1681 ( Apr. 20 , 1982 ) ; that he took steps to change his appearance at the Todd residence and then successfully fled to Florida , i d . , at 19181919 ( Apr. 22 , 1982 ) ; that he arrived in Florida exhibiting no signs of drug use or severe withdrawal , i d . , at 18751882 ( Apr. 21 , 1982 ) ; that he obtained false identification in a further effort to avoid apprehension , i d . , at 18811882 , and that he denied any memory lapses and described undergoing only minor drug withdrawal when police arrested him , i d . , at 19191920 ( Apr. 22 , 1982 ) . Given this wealth of evidence , there is no reasonable probability that the jury would have found that Cone was entitled to the substantial impairment mitigator had the evidence he seeks been made available to him .	@@empty@@	unmatched
And even if Cone could have presented this evidence to the jury at sentencing and established an entitlement to this mitigator , he still has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that it would have outweighed all of the aggravating factors supporting the jurys death sentence . See i d . , at 21512154 ( Apr. 23 , 1982 ) . In its decision on direct appeal , the Tennessee Supreme Court was well aware of the evidence regarding the degree and extent of [ Cones ] drug abuse. Cone , 665 S. W. 2d , at 90 . As part of its required independent review of whether the mitigation evidence was sufficiently substantial to outweigh the aggravating factors , see Tenn. Code Ann . § 392 - 205 , the Tennessee court nevertheless concluded that the sentence was not in any way disproportionate under all of the circumstances , including the brutal murders of two elderly defenseless persons by an escaping armed robber who had terrorized a residential neighborhood for twenty - four hours. 665 S. W. 2d , at 9596 . None of Cones proffered evidence places that conclusion , made by both the jury and the Tennessee Supreme Court , in such a different light as to undermine confidence in Cones sentence . Kyles , 514 U. S. , at 435 ; see also Strickler , 527 U. S. , at 296 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This Court should not vacate and remand lower court decisions based on nothing more than the vague suspicion that error might be present , or because the court below could have been more clear . This is especially so where , as here , the record before the Court is adequate to evaluate Cones Brady claims with respect to both the guilt and sentencing phases of his trial . The Courts willingness to return the sentencing issue to the District Court without any firm conviction that an error was committed by the Court of Appeals is inconsistent with our established practice and disrespectful to the lower courts that have considered this case . Worse still , the inevitable result will be years of additional delay in the execution of a death sentence lawfully imposed by a Tennessee jury . Because I would affirm the judgment below , I respectfully dissent .	@@empty@@	unmatched

This is a suit brought by the United States in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to recover possession of a strip of land on the Potomac River front of the City of Alexandria . Except an insignificant portion as to which no special defence was made and which it is agreed may be disregarded , this strip lay below low water mark until it was filled in by the United States in 1910 - 1912 by dredging from the bottom of the river and depositing the material on the other side of a riprap wall built on the river bed . Act of June 25 , 1910 , c. 382 , 36 Stat . 630 , 639 ; Act of February 27 , 1911 , c. 166 , 36 Stat . 933 , 937 . The United States enclosed the made land by a fence at high water mark , but the defendant , the plaintiff in error , claiming title to the adjoining land inshore , destroyed the fence and took possession , whereupon this action was brought . The defendant pleaded to the jurisdiction of the Court alleging that the land was not in the District but was part of Virginia . On this issue the Court found or ruled in favor of the plaintiff and afterwards did the same upon the general issue , a jury having been waived . Judgment for the plaintiff was affirmed by the Court of Appeals and the defendant took a writ of error to bring the case to this Court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A question is raised by the defendant in error as to the jurisdiction of this Court . The language of the Judicial Code ( Act of March 3 , 1911 , c. 231 ) § 250 , 36 Stat . 1087 , 1159 ( Comp St. § 1227 ) , is that any final judgment of the Court of Appeals may be reexamined ' First . In cases in which the jurisdiction of the trial court is in issue . ' The words taken literally cover this case , but it is argued that they should be construed as similar words in section 238 ( section 1215 ) concerning the District Courts are construed . In the latter instance , as is well known , they are confined to the jurisdiction of the District Courts as courts of the United States . But the jurisdiction of the District Courts is a limited jurisdiction based upon statutory grounds , and therefore the words of section 238 naturally enough were confined to what always is the first question in a case before them . The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia on the other hand is a court of general jurisdiction , and whether or not the clause of section 250 was suggested by the earlier one , we see no sufficient justification for denying to it the scope that it must have if it is given its natural sense . The plea to the jurisdiction raises the question clearly , and a certificate would add nothing to what the record shows .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We are not prepared to say that the judgment before us was not ' otherwise reviewable ' on the question of the boundary between the United States and Virginia , so far as the defendant drew in question the construction of the Revised Statutes relating to the District of Columbia , section 1 , Act June 22 , 1874 , hereafter discussed . We should hesitate to apply the decision in American Security & Trust Co. v. District of Columbia , 224 U. S. 491 , 32 Sup . Ct . 553 , 56 L. Ed . 856 , to such a case .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The question of the jurisdiction of the trial court and that of the merits very nearly coalesce , as the original title , at least , of Maryland and its jurisdiction were founded upon the same facts , and as the United States succeeded to the rights of Maryland by the grant of the District completed in 1791 . That the original title of Maryland extended at least to low water mark on the Virginia side it now is too late to deny , in view of the decisions in Maryland v. West Virginia , 217 U. S. 1 , 45 , 46 , 30 Sup . Ct . 268 , 54 L. Ed . 645 ; Id. , 217 U. S. 557 , 578 , 30 Sup . Ct . 630 , 54 L. Ed . 888 ; and Morris v. United States , 174 U. S. 196 , 19 Sup . Ct . 649 , 43 L. Ed . 946 . An attempt to throw doubt upon these authorities and upon the effect of the charter of Charles I , June 30 , 1632 , granting Maryland to Lord Baltimore ( ad ulteriorem dicti Fluminis Ripam et eam sequendo , etc . , 217 U. S. 25 , 30 Sup . Ct . 268 , 54 L. Ed . 645 ) , ' to the farther bank of the said Potomac river and following it , ' by the charters of James I to Virginia and especially by the terms of a grant from the Governor of Virginia to Howsing in 1669 must fail . The latter grant is subordinate to the former and is not inconsistent with it as the language is ' extending down Potomac River by various courses 3152 po . making a S. Wtly line to a pokecory , ' ect . The implication of the words ' by various courses ' that the grant follows the line of the stream is not changed by the words ' including several small creeks or inlets . ' The land in question is situated upon an indentation , called Battery Cove , but the place is not a creek or inlet . The former decisions of the Court must be followed so far as they go .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The original state of things was not changed by the grant of Virginia and the regrant by the United States of the part of the District on the Virginia side . They at least did not enlarge the rights of that State . The compact between Virginia and Maryland in 1785 also seems to us to have no bearing upon the case . It says nothing about the boundary in terms . Without going into the history of the compact or reciting it , we only need to remark that it was a regulation of commerce , and while with a view to opening up a route to the West it provided in Article 6 that the Potomac should be considered as a common highway for the purposes of navigation and commerce to the citizens of Virginia and Maryland , and in Article 7 gave the citizens of each State full property in the shores of the river adjoining their lands and the privilege of carrying out wharves , etc . , with a common right of fishing , it left the question of boundary open to long continued disputes . It may be laid on one side even if it ever was in force in the District of Columbia , which has been denied on the ground that the compact was abrogated so far as it affected this land by the grant of Virginia and was not revived by the grant to the United States .

The question of boundary remaining open was submitted to arbitration which ended in an award accepted by the parties in 1878 . But that was an arbitration between the two States and did not purport to affect the boundary of the District . The assent of the United States did not enlarge its scope . Act of March 3 , 1879 , c. 196 , 20 Stat . 481 . It is said that as the submission was to an ascertainment of the true boundary line the award must be taken to have determined it , but the question was confined to the boundary between the States as they then were , and whatever may be the force of the argument that the same principle ought to govern here , it was not and could not be adjudicated . Further discussion on this point is not needed . The award fixed low water mark on the Virginia side as the boundary , and is only material if at all as suggesting a claim that the low water line should be drawn from headland to headland and in that way include the indentation or cove where the United States has filled . But we know of no reason for construing the charter to Lord Baltimore as so limited or that to Howsing as importing such a rule .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The only important aspect of the last mentioned suggestion is in connection with a claim of prescriptive right . The land behind the filling of the United States is made land , and the fillings on the Alexandria side go below the original low water mark . In this case , however , there is no attempt to disturb the long maintained possession of such extentions whether originally warranted or not . The only question before us is of the rights of the United States to fill land that hitherto has been under water . The plaintiff in error seeks to exclude it by force of what already has been done and the claims of right that have been made in connection with it . If the taking possession of land under a deed purporting to convey more than the portion actually occupied , no doubt , within reasonable limits , the sovereign power might give to it the effect of adverse possession of the whole , as against other subjects of the same power . Montoya v. Gonzales , 232 U. S. 375 , 377 , 378 , 34 Sup . Ct . 413 , 58 L. Ed . 645 . But the effect of filling in upon the edge of a stream as against a different power is another matter . Such acts in themselves import no claim beyond the land thus occupied . Maryland and the United States are not called upon to scrutinize the discourse of those in Virginia even if in statutory form . Except so far as actually occupied the seizin of the land remains in the party that has the title . ' One who enters upon the land of another , though under color of title , gives no notice to that other of any claim , except to the extent of his actual occupancy . ' Hunnicutt v. Peyton , 102 U. S. 333 , 369 , 26 L. Ed . 113 . Still more is this true as against independent sovereign rights .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Finally , on the other hand , the Revised Statutes relating to the District of Columbia , June 22 , 1874 , § 1 , describe the District as ' including the river Potomac in its course through the District , ' which imports an assertion by Congress that the title of the United States embraces the whole river bed ; and the jurisdiction of the District over the river seems to have been exercised without dispute . For cases that have reached the reports see Alexandria Canal Railroad & Bridge Co. v. District of Columbia , 1 Mackey , 217 , 225 , 226 ; Smoot v. District of Columbia , 23 App . D. C. 266 ; Evans v.

It may happen that such filling as is done in this case will interrupt previously existing access to the water front .

In 1980 , the Michigan Legislature raised maximum weekly workers ' compensation benefits and provided an annual supplemental adjustment to workers injured before 1980 . The following year it enacted a statute allowing employers to decrease workers ' compensation benefits to those disabled employees eligible to receive wage - loss compensation from other employer - funded sources . Some employers , including petitioners , General Motors Corporation and Ford Motor Company , took the position that the 1981 law 's " benefit coordination " provision allowed them to reduce workers ' compensation benefits to workers injured before the statute 's effective date , who were receiving benefits from other sources . The State Supreme Court ultimately accepted this interpretation . Chambers v. General Motors Corp. , 422 Mich. 636 , 375 N.W.2d 715 . In 1987 , the legislature repudiated Chambers and required employers who had coordinated benefits for previously disabled workers under the 1981 law to refund the benefits withheld .

Held :	@@empty@@	unmatched
1 . The 1987 statute did not substantially impair the obligations of petitioners ' contracts with their employees in violation of the Contract Clause , because there was no contractual agreement regarding the specific terms allegedly at issue . The contracts were entered into after collective bargaining between the parties before the 1981 law was enacted and make no express mention of workers ' compensation benefits . Nor was the workers ' compensation law an implied contract term whereby employers promised to pay the amount required by law for each payment period , an obligation that was completed by making payments for any disability period . There was no occasion for the parties to consider in bargaining taking place before the 1981 law 's effective date the question whether an unanticipated reduction in benefits could later be restored after the " benefit period " had closed . Petitioners err in arguing that such a term is " incorporated " by law into the employment contracts , regardless of the parties ' assent . Michigan law does not explicitly imply a contractual term allowing an employer to depend on the closure of past disability compensation periods ; and such a right does not appear to be so central to the bargained - for exchange between the parties , or to the enforceability of the contract as a whole , that it must be deemed to be a contract term . State regulations are usually implied terms regardless of assent only when those laws affect the validity , construction , and enforcement of contracts . See United States Trust Co. of New York v. New Jersey , 431 U.S. 1 , 19 , n. 17 , 97 S.Ct . 1505 , 1516 , n. 17 , 52 L.Ed.2d 92 . While changes in the laws that make a contract legally enforceable may trigger Contract Clause scrutiny if they impair the obligation of pre - existing contracts , even if they do not alter the contracts ' bargained - for terms , the 1987 statute did not change the legal enforceability of the contracts here . The parties still have the same ability to enforce the bargained - for terms that they did before the 1987 statute 's enactment . Petitioners ' suggestion that every workplace regulation should be read into private employment contracts would expand the definition of contract so far that the Contract Clause would lose its purpose of enabling individuals to order their personal and business affairs according to their particular needs and interests ; would cause the Clause to protect against all changes in legislation , regardless of those changes ' effect on bargained - for agreements ; would severely limit the ability of state legislatures to amend their regulatory legislation ; and could render the Clause entirely dependent on state law .

It preserved the legislative compromise that had been struck by the 1980 - 1981 lawsgiving workers injured before 1982 their full benefits without coordination , but not the greater increases made to subsequently injured workersand equalized the payments made by employers who had relied on Chambers with those who had not , cf .

Among other things , the 1980 legislation raised maximum weekly benefits to 90 % of the state average weekly wage , and provided workers injured before 1980 an annual supplemental adjustment of their benefits of up to five percent . Mich . Comp . Laws Ann . § § 418.355(2 ) , 418.352(1 ) ( 1982 ) .

Mich . Comp . Laws Ann . § 418.354 ( 1982 ) . This provision , allowing what is called " benefit coordination , " is at the heart of the controversy in this case .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The benefit coordination provision did not specify whether it was to be applied to workers injured before its effective date , March 31 , 1982 . Petitioners took the position that the 1981 law allowed them to reduce workers ' compensation benefits to workers injured before March 31 , 1982 , who were receiving benefits from other sources . For example , GM cut respondent Romein 's weekly payment by $ 132.00 per week , and Ford cut respondent Gonzalez 's payment by $ 176.00 per week . The lower state courts disagreed with petitioners ' interpretation , holding that coordination was allowed only for employees injured after 1982 . See , e.g. , Franks v. White Pine Copper Div . , Copper Range Co. , 122 Mich . App . 177 , 185 , 332 N.W.2d 447 , 449 ( 1982 ) . Both Houses of the Michigan Legislature passed a concurrent resolution declaring that the coordination provisions were " not designed to disrupt benefits which were already being received by an employee prior to the effective date of this act or benefits resulting from injuries incurred prior to the act 's effective date . " See Senate Concurrent Res . 575 , adopted by the Senate on April 1 , 1982 , and by the House on May 18 , 1982 . 1982 Senate J. 626 , 706 - 707 ; 1982 House J. 1262 .

Meanwhile , petitioners continued to attempt to persuade the Michigan courts that the 1981 statute should be applied to workers injured before its effective date . In 1985 , petitioners ' interpretation was accepted by the Michigan Supreme Court . Chambers v. General Motors Corp. , decided together with Franks v. White Pine Copper Div . , Copper Range Co. , 422 Mich. 636 , 375 N.W.2d 715 . The court held that the benefit coordination provision applied to all payment periods after its effective date , regardless of the date the employee had been injured . The court also held that application of the coordination provisions to employees injured before 1982 did not violate the Contract Clause or the Due Process Clause .	@@empty@@	unmatched
After the decision in Chambers , employers who had not coordinated benefits for employees injured before 1982 began to demand reimbursement from these employees . See Jones , Firms Cut Checks for Disabled Workers , Detroit Free Press , Nov. 29 , 1985 , p. 3A. The Michigan Legislature responded almost immediately by introducing legislation to overturn the court 's decision . On October 16 , 1985 , before the Michigan Supreme Court had ruled on the motion for rehearing in Chambers , House Bill 5084 was introduced . As amended and passed by the House on January 29 , 1986 , the Bill repudiated the Chambers decision , declared that employers who had not coordinated benefits before the Chambers decision could not seek reimbursement from affected employees , and required employers who had coordinated benefits before Chambers to reimburse their employees . Meanwhile , the Senate passed its own version of the bill , Senate Bill 67 , also disapproving the Chambers decision and providing that employers could not require employees to reimburse them for benefits not coordinated after 1982 . The Senate bill was amended by a Conference Committee to provide for reimbursement of benefits withheld as a result of coordination , putting employers who had coordinated benefits for previously disabled workers in the same position as those who had not .

As a result of the 1987 statute , petitioners were ordered to refund nearly $ 25 million to disabled employees . They protested that the provision requiring reimbursement of benefits withheld was unfairly retroactive and violated the Contract Clause and Due Process Clause . The Michigan Supreme Court upheld the statute against these challenges , on the ground that the employers had no vested rights in coordination for Contract Clause purposes , and that the retroactive provisions furthered a rational legislative purpose . 436 Mich. 515 , 462 N.W.2d 555 ( 1990 ) .

Article I , § 10 of the Constitution provides : " No State shall . . . pass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts .

Generally , we first ask whether the change in state law has " operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship . " Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus , 438 U.S. 234 , 244 , 98 S.Ct . 2716 , 2722 , 57 L.Ed.2d 727 ( 1978 ) ; Energy Reserves Group , Inc. , v. Kansas Power & Light Co. , 459 U.S. 400 , 411 , 103 S.Ct . 697 , 704 , 74 L.Ed.2d 569 ( 1983 ) . This inquiry has three components : whether there is a contractual relationship , whether a change in law impairs that contractual relationship , and whether the impairment is substantial . Normally , the first two are unproblematic , and we need address only the third . In this case , however , we need not reach the questions of impairment , as we hold that there was no contractual agreement regarding the specific workers ' compensation terms allegedly at issue .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The contracts allegedly impaired by the 1987 statute are employment contracts entered into after collective bargaining between petitioners and respondents . It is undisputed that the contracts themselves were formed before the 1981 law was enacted requiring benefit coordination . It is also undisputed that the contracts make no express mention of workers ' compensation benefits . Petitioners argue that the workers ' compensation law is an implied term of the contracts , because the parties bargained for other compensation with workers ' compensation benefits in mind . This implied term that was allegedly impaired by the 1987 statute is defined as : a promise to pay the amount of workers ' compensation required by law for each payment period . Once performance of this obligation is completed by making payments for any disability period , petitioners claim that they have a settled expectation that can not be undone by later state legislation . Because the 1987 statute " reopens " these closed transactions , petitioners contend its retroactive provisions violate the Contract Clause .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Michigan Supreme Court held that the term suggested by petitioners was not an implied term of the employment contracts between petitioners and respondents . We " accord respectful consideration and great weight to the views of the State 's highest court , " though ultimately we are " bound to decide for ourselves whether a contract was made . " Indiana ex rel . Anderson v. Brand , 303 U.S. 95 , 100 , 58 S.Ct . 443 , 446 , 82 L.Ed . 685 ( 1938 ) . The question whether a contract was made is a federal question for purposes of Contract Clause analysis , see Irving Trust Co. v. Day , 314 U.S. 556 , 561 , 62 S.Ct . 398 , 401 , 86 L.Ed . 452 ( 1942 ) , and " whether it turns on issues of general or purely local law , we can not surrender the duty to exercise our own judgment . " Appleby v. City of New York , 271 U.S. 364 , 380 , 46 S.Ct . 569 , 573 , 70 L.Ed . 992 ( 1926 ) .

While it is true that the terms to which the contracting parties give assent may be express or implied in their dealings , cf . Garrison v. City of New York , 21 Wall . 196 , 203 , 22 L.Ed . 612 ( 1875 ) , the contracting parties here in no way manifested assent to limiting disability payments in accordance with the 1981 law allowing coordination of benefits . The employment contracts at issue were formed before the 1981 law allowing coordination of benefits came into effect . Thus , there was no occasion for the parties to consider in bargaining the question raised here : whether an unanticipated reduction in benefits could later be restored after the " benefit period " had closed .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Petitioners argue that their right to rely on past payment periods as " closed " is a contractual term " incorporated " by law into the employment contracts , regardless of the assent , express or implied , of the parties . While petitioners cite passages from our prior decisions that " ' the laws which subsist at the time and place of the making of a contract . . . enter into and form a part of it , ' " Home Building & Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell , 290 U.S. 398 , 429 - 430 , 54 S.Ct . 231 , 236 - 237 , 78 L.Ed . 413 ( 1934 ) ( quoting Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy , 4 Wall . 535 , 550 , 18 L.Ed . 403 ( 1867 ) ) , that principle has no application here , since petitioners have not shown that the alleged right to rely on past payment periods as closed was part of Michigan law at the time of the original contract . Though Michigan courts , in awarding interest on unpaid workers ' compensation awards , had held that such awards were more analogous to contractual damages than tort damages , see , e.g. , Wilson v. Doehler - Jarvis Division of National Lead Co. , 358 Mich. 510 , 517 - 519 , 100 N.W.2d 226 , 229 - 230 ( 1960 ) ; Brown v. Eller Outdoor Advertising Co. , 139 Mich . App . 7 , 14 , 360 N.W.2d 322 , 326 ( 1984 ) , Michigan law does not explicitly imply a contractual term allowing an employer to depend on the closure of past disability compensation periods . Moreover , such right does not appear to be so central to the bargained - for exchange between the parties , or to the enforceability of the contract as a whole , that it must be deemed to be a term of the contract .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Contrary to petitioners ' suggestion , we have not held that all state regulations are implied terms of every contract entered into while they are effective , especially when the regulations themselves can not be fairly interpreted to require such incorporation . For the most part , state laws are implied into private contracts regardless of the assent of the parties only when those laws affect the validity , construction , and enforcement of contracts . See United States Trust Co. of New York v. New Jersey , 431 U.S. 1 , 19 , n. 17 , 97 S.Ct . 1505 , 1516 , n. 17 , 52 L.Ed.2d 92 ( 1977 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
While it is somewhat misleading to characterize laws affecting the enforceability of contracts as " incorporated terms " of a contract , see 3 A. Corbin , Corbin on Contracts § 551 , pp . 199 - 200 ( 1960 ) , these laws are subject to Contract Clause analysis because without them , contracts are reduced to simple , unenforceable promises . " The obligation of a contract consists in its binding force on the party who makes it . This depends on the laws in existence when it is made ; these are necessarily referred to in all contracts , and forming a part of them as the measure of the obligation to perform them by the one party , and the right acquired by the other . . . . If any subsequent law affect to diminish the duty , or to impair the right , it necessarily bears on the obligation of the contract . " McCracken v. Hayward , 2 How . 608 , 612 , 11 L.Ed . 397 ( 1844 ) . See also , Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy , supra . A change in the remedies available under a contract , for example , may convert an agreement enforceable at law into a mere promise , thereby impairing the contract 's obligatory force . See Sturges v. Crowninshield , 4 Wheat . 122 , 197 - 198 , 4 L.Ed . 529 ( 1819 ) ; Edwards v. Kearzey , 96 U.S. 595 , 601 , 24 L.Ed . 793 ( 1878 ) . For this reason , changes in the laws that make a contract legally enforceable may trigger Contract Clause scrutiny if they impair the obligation of pre - existing contracts , even if they do not alter any of the contracts ' bargained - for terms . See , e.g. , Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy , supra ( repeal of tax designed to repay bond issue ) ; Bronson v. Kinzie , 1 How . 311 , 316 , 11 L.Ed . 143 ( 1843 ) ( law limiting foreclosure rights ) ; McCracken , supra , 2 How . at 611 - 614 ( same ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The 1987 statute did not change the legal enforceability of the employment contracts here . The parties still have the same ability to enforce the bargained - for terms of the employment contracts that they did before the 1987 statute was enacted . Moreover , petitioners ' suggestion that we should read every workplace regulation into the private contractual arrangements of employers and employees would expand the definition of contract so far that the constitutional provision would lose its anchoring purpose , i.e. , " enabling individuals to order their personal and business affairs according to their particular needs and interests . " Allied Structural Steel , 438 U.S. , at 245 , 98 S.Ct . at 2723 . Instead , the Clause would protect against all changes in legislation , regardless of the effect of those changes on bargained - for agreements . The employment contract , in petitioners ' view , could incorporate workplace safety regulations , employment tax obligations , and laws prohibiting workplace discrimination , even if these laws are not intended to affect private contracts and are not subject to bargaining between the employer and employees . Moreover , petitioners ' construction would severely limit the ability of state legislatures to amend their regulatory legislation . Amendments could not take effect until all existing contracts expired , and parties could evade regulation by entering into long - term contracts . The ultimate irony of petitioners ' proposed principle is that , taken to an extreme , it would render the Contract Clause itself entirely dependent on state law . As Justice Story pointed out :	@@empty@@	unmatched
" It has been contended , by some learned minds , that the municipal law of the place where a contract is made forms a part of it , and travels with it , wherever the parties to it may be found . If this were admitted to be true , the consequence would be , that all the existing laws of a State , being incorporated into the contract , would constitute a part of its stipulations . . . . If , therefore , the legislature should provide , by a law , that all contracts thereafter made should be subject to the entire control of the legislature , as to their obligation , validity , and execution , whatever might be their terms , they would be completely within the legislative power , and might be impaired or extinguished by future laws ; thus having a complete ex post facto operation .

Petitioners also contend that the 1987 statute violated Due Process because its retroactive provisions unreasonably interfered with closed transactions . Retroactive legislation presents problems of unfairness that are more serious than those posed by prospective legislation , because it can deprive citizens of legitimate expectations and upset settled transactions . For this reason , " the retroactive aspects of economic legislation , as well as the prospective aspects , must meet the test of due process " : a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by rational means .

The statute in this case meets that standard . The purpose of the 1987 statute was to correct the unexpected results of the Michigan Supreme Court 's Chambers opinion . The retroactive repayment provision of the 1987 statute was a rational means of meeting this legitimate objective : It preserved the delicate legislative compromise that had been struck by the 1980 - 1981 laws giving workers injured before 1982 their full benefits without coordination , but not the greater increases given to subsequently injured workers . Also , it equalized the payments made by employers who had gambled on the Chambers decision with those made by employers who had not . Cf . United States v. Sperry Corp. , 493 U.S. 52 , 64 - 65 , 110 S.Ct . 387 , 396 - 397 , 107 L.Ed.2d 290 ( 1989 ) ( legitimate to legislate retrospectively in order to ensure that similarly situated persons bear similar financial burdens of program ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In sum , petitioners knew they were taking a risk in reducing benefits to their workers , but they took their chances with their interpretation of the 1981 law .

In an indictment upon a statute , it is not sufficient to set forth the offence in the words of the statute , unless those words of themselves fully , directly , and expressly , without any uncertainty or ambiguity , set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offence intended to be punished ; and the fact that the statute in question , read in the light of the common law , and of other statutes on the like matter , enables the court to infer the intent of the legislature , does not dispense with the necessity of alleging in the indictment all the facts necessary to bring the case within that intent .

The language of the statute on which this indictment is founded includes the case of every person who , with intent to defraud , utters any forged obligation of the United States .

' Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled , that all appropriations for the current and contingent expenses of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and for fulfilling treaty stipulations with various Indian tribes , which shall remain unprovided for on June thirtieth , nineteen hundred and fifteen , are continued and made available for and during the fiscal year nineteen hundred and sixteen to the same extent , in detail , and under the same conditions , restrictions , and limitations for the fiscal year nineteen hundred and sixteen as the same were provided for on account of the fiscal year nineteen hundred and fifteen in the Indian Appropriation Act for that fiscal year . For all of such purposes a sufficient sum is appropriated , out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated , or out of funds to the credit of Indians as the same were respectively provided in the Indian Appropriation Act for the fiscal year nineteen hundred and fifteen : Provided , that the appropriations from the treasury of the United States or from Indian funds shall not exceed in the aggregate the amounts of such appropriations for the fiscal year nineteen hundred and fifteen : Provided further , that this joint resolution shall not be const ued as providing for or authorizing the duplication of any special payment or for the execution of any purpose provided for in said Appropriation Act that was intended to be paid only once or done solely on account of the fiscal year nineteen hundred and fifteen . * * * ' 38 Stat . 1228 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The original bill alleged that no part of the $ 205,000 appropriated by Act of August 1 , 1914 , was for expenses of the Bureau of Indian Affairs or for fulfilling treaty stipulations with Chippewa Indians of Minnesota , but all ( except the $ 40,000 item not here involved ) was for special payments and limited to fiscal year ending June 30 , 1915 ; that it was not intended as a regular annual appropriation and the Joint Resolution of 1915 in express language excluded such items in Act of 1914 from being re - expended during 1916 ; that notwithstanding this the Comptroller of the Treasury had ruled the Joint Resolution did reappropriate $ 160,000 , and the Secretary of the Interior and Commissioner of Indian Affairs were preparing to expend such sum out of Indians ' trust funds ; and that unless enjoined they would draw warrants therefor upon the treasury which would be honored .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Upon motion , the trial court dismissed the bill for want of equity . The Court of Appeals reversed the decree , holding the Joint Resolution did not reappropriate $ 160,000 and the relief prayed should have been granted .

The only point presented for decision is whether by the language used Congress has sufficiently indicated an intent to appropriate the money in question . The bill does not challenge its power .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Under an act approved January 14 , 1889 ( 25 Stat . 642 , c. 24 ) , lands in Minnesota occupied by Chippewa Indians were disposed of and proceeds deposited to their credit in the United States treasury , it being agreed that the fund should bear 5 per cent . interest to be paid directly to the Indians or used for their schools , and further ' that Congress may , in its discretion , from time to time , during the said period of fifty years , appropriate , for the purpose of promoting civilization and self - support among the said Indians , a portion of said principal sum , not exceeding five per centum thereof . ' For many years subsequent to 1889 , under the general head of ' Current and contingent expenses of the Indian Department * * * and fulfilling treaty stipulations with various Indian tribes , ' appropriations were made for general benefit of Chippewas ' to be reimbursed to the United States out of the proceeds of sales of their lands . ' In 1911 their funds derived from land sales had become very large ; and beginning then and continuing down to 1914 the annual Indian appropriations bill contained an item essentially similar ( except as to amounts ) both in words and position to the one in section 8 , Act of 1914 quoted above .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It seems clear that ' civilization and self - support ' among the Indians can not be promoted effectively by disconnected efforts , but must be accomplished , if at all , by definite , permanent plans operating through many years . And in view of the long - continued practice of Congress to provide funds for such continuous efforts by annual appropriations , the circumstances under which the Joint Resolution became law , and the studied incorporation therein of the language of former appropriation acts , we think the purpose was to authorize expenditure of $ 160,000 during 1916 , as had been done for 1915 . A different construction might have occasioned disruption of well ordered arrangements for advancing the nation 's wards , to the great detriment of all concerned ; and to such unfortunate consequences experienced legislators probably were not oblivious .	@@empty@@	unmatched

In the early part of 1892 a revolution was initiated in Venezuela , against the administration thereof , which the revolutionists claimed had ceased to be the legitimate government . The principal parties to this conflict were those who recognized Palacio as their head , and those who followed the leadership of Crespo . Gen. Hernandez belonged to the antiadministration party , and commanded its forces in the vicinity of Ciudad Bolivar . On the 8th of August , 1892 , an engagement took place between the arimes of the two parties at Buena Vista , some seven miles from Bolivar , in which the troops under Hernandez prevailed ; and , on the 13th of August , Hernandez entered Bolivar , and assumed command of the city . All of the local officials had in the meantime left , and the vacant positions were filled by Gen. Hernandez , who from that date , and during the period of the transactions complained of , was the civil and military chief of the city and district . In October the party in revolt had achieved success generally , taking possession of the capital of Venezuela , October 6th ; and on October 23 , 1892 , the ' Crespo government , ' so called , was formally recognized as the legitimate government of Venezuela by the United States .	@@empty@@	unmatched
George F. Underhill was a citizen of the United States , who had constructed a waterworks system for the city of Bolivar , under a contract with the government , and was engaged in supplying the place with water ; and he also carried on a machiney repair business .

Mr. Chief Justice FULLER , after stating the facts in the foregoing language , delivered the opinion of the court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Every sovereign state is bound to respect the independence of every other sovereign state , and the courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another , done within its own territory . Redress of grievances by reason of such acts must be obtained through the means open to be availed of by sovereign powers as between themselves .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Nor can the principle be confined to lawful or recognized governments , or to cases where redress can manifestly be had through public channels . The immunity of individuals from suits brought in foreign tribunals for acts done within their own states , in the exercise of governmental authority , whether as civil officers or as military commanders , must necessarily extend to the agents of governments ruling by paramount force as matter of fact . Where a civil war prevails ( that is , where the people of a country are divided into two hostile parties , who take up arms and oppose one another by military force ) , generally speaking , foreign nations do not assume to judge of the merits of the quarrel . If the party seeking to dislodge the existing government succeeds , and the independence of the government it has set up is recognized , then the acts of such government , from the commencement of its existence , are regarded as those of an independent nation . If the political revolt fails of success , still , if actual war has been waged , acts of legitimate warfare can not be made the basis of individual liability . U. S. v. Rice , 4 Wheat . 246 ; Fleming v. Page , 9 How . 603 ; Thorington v. Smith , 8 Wall . 1 ; Williams v. Bruffy , 96 U. S. 176 ; Ford v. Surget , 97 U. S. 594 ; Dow v. Johnson , 100 U. S. 158 ; and other cases .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Revolutions or insurrections may inconvenience other nations , but by accommodation to the facts the application of settled rules is readily reached . And , where the fact of the existence of war is in issue in the instance of complaint of acts committed within foreign territory , it is not an absolute prerequisite that that fact should be made out by an acknowledgment of belligerency , as other official recognition of its existence may be sufficient proof thereof . The Three Friends , 166 U. S. 1 , 17 Sup . Ct . 495 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In this case the archives of the state department show that civil war was flagrant in Venezuela from the spring of 1892 , that the revolution was successful , and that the revolutionary government was recognized by the United States as the government of the country ; it being , to use the language of the secretary of state in a communication to our minister to Venezuela , ' accepted by the people , in the possession of the power of the nation , and fully established . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
That these were facts of which the court is bound to take judicial notice , and for information as to which it may consult the department of state , there can be no doubt . Jones v. U. S. , 137 U. S. 202 , 11 Sup . Ct . 80 ; Mighell v. Sultan of Jahore 1894 1 Q. B. 149 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is idle to argue that the proceedings of those who thus triumphed should be treated as the acts of baditti , or mere mobs .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We entertain no doubt , upon the evidence , that Hernandez was carrying on military operations in support of the revolutionary party . It may be that adherents of that side of the controversy in the particular locality where Hernandez was the leader of the movement entertained a preference for him as the future executive head of the nation , but that is beside the question . The acts complained of were the acts of a military commander representing the authority of the revolutionary party as a government , which afterwards succeeded , and was recognized by the United States . We think the circuit court of appeals was justified in concluding ' that the acts of the defendant were the acts of the government of Venezuela , and as such are not properly the subject of adjudication in the courts of another government . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
The decisions cited on plaintiff 's behalf are not in point . Cases respecting arrests by military authority in the absence of the prevalence of war , or the validity of contracts between individuals entered into in aid of insurrection , or the right or revolutionary bodies to vex the commerce of the world on its common highway without incurring the penalties denounced on piracy , and the like , do not involve the questions presented here .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We agree with the circuit court of appeals that ' the evidence upon the trial indicated that the purpose of the defendant in his treatment of the plaintiff was to coerce the plaintiff to operate his waterworks and his repair works for the benefit of the community and the revolutionary forces , ' and that ' it was not sufficient to have warranted a finding by the jury that the defendant was actuated by malice or any personal or private motive , ' and we concur in its disposition of the rulings below .

As Director of Community Intensive Training for Youth ( CITY ) , a program for underprivileged youth operated by Central Alabama Community College ( CACC ) , petitioner Edward Lane conducted an audit of the program ’s expenses and discovered that Suzanne Schmitz , an Alabama State Representative on CITY ’s payroll , had not been reporting for work . Lane eventually terminated Schmitz’ employment . Shortly thereafter , federal authorities indicted Schmitz on charges of mail fraud and theft concerning a program receiving federal funds . Lane testified , under subpoena , regarding the events that led to his terminating Schmitz . Schmitz was convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison . Meanwhile , CITY was experiencing significant budget shortfalls . Respondent Franks , then CACC ’s president , terminated Lane along with 28 other employees in a claimed effort to address the financial difficulties . A few days later , however , Franks rescinded all but 2 of the 29 terminations — those of Lane and one other employee . Lane sued Franks in his individual and official capacities under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 , alleging that Franks had violated the First Amendment by firing him in retaliation for testifying against Schmitz .

Almost 50 years ago , this Court declared that citizens do not surrender their First Amendment rights by accepting public employment . Rather , the First Amendment protection of a public employee ’s speech depends on a careful balance “ between the interests of the [ employee ] , as a citizen , in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State , as an employer , in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees . ” Pickering v. Board of Ed . of Township High School Dist . 205 , Will Cty . , 391 U. S. 563 , 568 ( 1968 ) . In Pickering , the Court struck the balance in favor of the public employee , extending First Amendment protection to a teacher who was fired after writing a letter to the editor of a local newspaper criticizing the school board that employed him . Today , we consider whether the First Amendment similarly protects a public employee who provided truthful sworn testimony , compelled by sub - poena , outside the course of his ordinary job responsibilities . We hold that it does .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
In 2006 , Central Alabama Community College ( CACC ) hired petitioner Edward Lane to be the Director of Community Intensive Training for Youth ( CITY ) , a statewide program for underprivileged youth . CACC hired Lane on a probationary basis . In his capacity as Director , Lane was responsible for overseeing CITY ’s day - to - day operations , hiring and firing employees , and making decisions with respect to the program ’s finances .	@@empty@@	unmatched
At the time of Lane ’s appointment , CITY faced significant financial difficulties . That prompted Lane to conduct a comprehensive audit of the program ’s expenses . The audit revealed that Suzanne Schmitz , an Alabama State Representative on CITY ’s payroll , had not been reporting to her CITY office . After unfruitful discussions with Schmitz , Lane shared his finding with CACC ’s president and its attorney . They warned him that firing Schmitz could have negative repercussions for him and CACC .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Lane nonetheless contacted Schmitz again and in - structed her to show up to the Huntsville office to serveas a counselor . Schmitz refused ; she responded that shewished to “ ‘ continue to serve the CITY program in the same manner as [ she had ] in the past.’ ” Lane v. Central Ala. Community College , 523 Fed . Appx . 709 , 710 ( CA11 2013 ) ( per curiam ) . Lane fired her shortly thereafter . Schmitz told another CITY employee , Charles Foley , that she intended to “ ‘ get [ Lane ] back’ ” for firing her . 2012 WL 5289412 , * 1 ( ND Ala. , Oct. 18 , 2012 ) . She also said that if Lane ever requested money from the state legislature for the program , she would tell him , “ ‘ [ y]ou’re fired.’ ” Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Schmitz’ termination drew the attention of many , including agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , which initiated an investigation into Schmitz’ employment with CITY . In November 2006 , Lane testified before a federal grand jury about his reasons for firing Schmitz . In January 2008 , the grand jury indicted Schmitz on four counts of mail fraud and four counts of theft concerning a program receiving federal funds . See United States v. Schmitz , 634 F. 3d 1247 , 1256–1257 ( CA11 2011 ) . The indictment alleged that Schmitz had collected $ 177,251.82 in federal funds even though she performed “ ‘ virtually no services,’ ” “ ‘ generated virtually no work product,’ ” and “ ‘ rarely even appeared for work at the CITY Program offices.’ ” Id. , at 1260 . It further alleged that Schmitz had submitted false statements concerning the hours she worked and the nature of the services she performed . Id. , at 1257 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Schmitz’ trial , which garnered extensive press coverage , 1 commenced in August 2008 . Lane testified , under subpoena , regarding the events that led to his terminating Schmitz . The jury failed to reach a verdict . Roughly six months later , federal prosecutors retried Schmitz , and Lane testified once again . This time , the jury convicted Schmitz on three counts of mail fraud and four countsof theft concerning a program receiving federal funds . The District Court sentenced her to 30 months in prison and ordered her to pay $ 177,251.82 in restitution and forfeiture .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Meanwhile , CITY continued to experience considerable budget shortfalls . In November 2008 , Lane began reporting to respondent Steve Franks , who had become president of CACC in January 2008 . Lane recommended that Franks consider layoffs to address the financial difficulties . In January 2009 , Franks decided to terminate 29 probationary CITY employees , including Lane . Shortly thereafter , however , Franks rescinded all but 2 of the 29 terminations — those of Lane and one other employee— because of an “ ambiguity in [ those other employees’ ] probationary service . ” Brief for Respondent Franks 11 . Franks claims that he “ did not rescind Lane ’s termination . . . because he believed that Lane was in a fundamentally different category than the other employees : he was the director of the entire CITY program , and not simply an employee . ” Ibid .

Franks later retired , and respondent Susan Burrow , the current Acting President of CACC , replaced him while this case was pending before the Eleventh Circuit .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In January 2011 , Lane sued Franks in his individual and official capacities under Rev. Stat . § 1979 , 42 U. S.

The District Court granted Franks’ motion for summary judgment . Although the court concluded that the record raised “ genuine issues of material fact . . . concerning [ Franks’ ] true motivation for terminating [ Lane ’s ] employment , ” 2012 WL 5289412 , * 6 , it held that Franks was entitled to qualified immunity as to the damages claims because “ a reasonable government official in [ Franks’ ] position would not have had reason to believe that the Constitution protected [ Lane ’s ] testimony , ” i d . , * 12 . The District Court relied on Garcetti v. Ceballos , 547 U. S. 410 ( 2006 ) , which held that “ ‘ when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties , the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment pur - poses.’ ” 2012 WL 5289412 , * 10 ( quoting Garcetti , 547 U. S.,at 421 ) . The court found no violation of clearly established law because Lane had “ learned of the information that he testified about while working as Director at [ CITY ] , ” such that his “ speech [ could ] still be considered as part of his official job duties and not made as a citizen on a matter of public concern . ” 2012 WL 5289412 , * 10 .

The Eleventh Circuit affirmed . 523 Fed . Appx . , at 710 . Like the District Court , it relied extensively on Garcetti . It reasoned that , “ [ e]ven if an employee was not required to make the speech as part of his official duties , he enjoys no First Amendment protection if his speech ‘ owes its existence to [ the ] employee ’s professional responsibilities’ and is ‘ a product that the “ employer himself has commissioned or created . ” ’ ” Id. , at 711 ( quoting Abdur - Rahman v. Walker , 567 F. 3d 1278 , 1283 ( CA11 2009 ) ) . The court concluded that Lane spoke as an employee and not as a citizen because he was acting pursuant to his official duties when he investigated Schmitz’ employment , spoke with Schmitz and CACC officials regarding the issue , and terminated Schmitz . 523 Fed . Appx . , at 712 . “ That Lane testified about his official activities pursuant to a sub - poena and in the litigation context , ” the court continued,“does not bring Lane ’s speech within the protection of the First Amendment . ” Ibid . The Eleventh Circuit also concluded that , “ even if . . . a constitutional violation of Lane ’s First Amendment rights occurred in these circumstances , Franks would be entitled to qualified immunity in his personal capacity ” because the right at issue had not been clearly established . Id. , at 711 , n. 2 .

We granted certiorari , 571 U. S. _ _ ( 2014 ) , to resolve discord among the Courts of Appeals as to whether public employees may be fired — or suffer other adverse employment consequences — for providing truthful subpoenaed testimony outside the course of their ordinary job responsibilities . Compare 523 Fed . Appx . , at 712 ( case below ) , with , e.g. , Reilly v. Atlantic City , 532 F. 3d 216 , 231 ( CA3 2008 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Speech by citizens on matters of public concern lies at the heart of the First Amendment , which “ was fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people , ” Roth v. United States , 354 U. S. 476 , 484 ( 1957 ) . This remains true when speech concerns information related to or learned through public employment . After all , public employees do not renounce their citizenship when they accept employment , and this Court has cautioned time and again that public employers may not condition employment on the relinquishment of constitutional rights . See , e.g. , Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ . of State of N. Y. , 385 U. S. 589 , 605 ( 1967 ) ; Pickering , 391 U. S. , at 568 ; Connick v. Myers , 461 U. S. 138 , 142 ( 1983 ) . There is considerable value , moreover , in encouraging , rather than inhibiting , speech by public employees . For “ [ g]overnment employees are often in the best position to know what ails the agencies for which they work . ” Waters v. Churchill , 511 U. S. 661 , 674 ( 1994 ) ( plurality opinion ) . “ The interest at stake is as much the public ’s interest in receiving informed opinion as it is the employee ’s own right to disseminate it . ” San Diego v. Roe , 543 U. S. 77 , 82 ( 2004 ) ( per curiam ) .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
Our precedents have also acknowledged the government ’s countervailing interest in controlling the operation of its workplaces . See , e.g. , Pickering , 391 U. S. , at 568 . “ Government employers , like private employers , need a significant degree of control over their employees’ words and actions ; without it , there would be little chance for the efficient provision of public services . ” Garcetti , 547 U.

Pickering provides the framework for analyzing whether the employee ’s interest or the government ’s interest should prevail in cases where the government seeks to curtail the speech of its employees . It requires “ balanc[ing ] . . . the interests of the [ public employee ] , as a citizen , in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State , as an employer , in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees . ” 391 U. S. , at 568 . In Pickering , the Court held that a teacher ’s letter to the editor of a local news - paper concerning a school budget constituted speech on amatter of public concern . Id. , at 571 . And in balancing the employee ’s interest in such speech against the government ’s efficiency interest , the Court held that the publication of the letter did not “ imped[e ] the teacher ’s proper performance of his daily duties in the classroom ” or “ interfer[e ] with the regular operation of the schools generally . ” Id. , at 572–573 . The Court therefore held that the teacher ’s speech could not serve as the basis for his dismissal . Id. , at 574 .	@@empty@@	unmatched

“ The first requires determining whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern .

The question becomes whether the relevant government entity had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public . ” 547 U.

In describing the first step in this inquiry , Garcetti distinguished between employee speech and citizen speech . Whereas speech as a citizen may trigger protection , the Court held that “ when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties , the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment pur - poses , and the Constitution does not insulate their communi - cations from employer discipline . ” Id. , at 421 . Applying that rule to the facts before it , the Court found that an internal memorandum prepared by a prosecutor in the course of his ordinary job responsibilities constituted unprotected employee speech .

Truthful testimony under oath by a public employee outside the scope of his ordinary job duties is speech as a citizen for First Amendment purposes . That is so even when the testimony relates to his public employment or concerns information learned during that employment .

In rejecting Lane ’s argument that his testimony was speech as a citizen , the Eleventh Circuit gave short shrift to the nature of sworn judicial statements and ignored the obligation borne by all witnesses testifying under oath . See 523 Fed . Appx . , at 712 ( finding immaterial the fact that Lane spoke “ pursuant to a subpoena and in the litigation context ” ) . Sworn testimony in judicial proceedings is a quintessential example of speech as a citizen for a simple reason : Anyone who testifies in court bears an obligation , to the court and society at large , to tell the truth . See , e.g. , 18 U. S. C. § 1623 ( criminalizing false statements under oath in judicial proceedings ) ; United States v. Mandujano , 425 U. S. 564 , 576 ( 1976 ) ( plurality opinion ) ( “ Perjured testimony is an obvious and flagrant affront to the basic concept of judicial proceedings ” ) . When the person testifying is a public employee , he may bear separate obligations to his employer — for example , an obligation not to show up to court dressed in an unprofessional manner . But any such obligations as an employee are distinct and independent from the obligation , as a citizen , to speak the truth . That independent obligation renders sworn testimony speech as a citizen and sets it apart from speech made purely in the capacity of an employee .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In holding that Lane did not speak as a citizen whenhe testified , the Eleventh Circuit read Garcetti far too broadly . It reasoned that , because Lane learned of the sub - ject matter of his testimony in the course of his employment with CITY , Garcetti requires that his testimony be treated as the speech of an employee rather than that of a citizen . See 523 Fed . Appx . , at 712 . It does not .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The sworn testimony in this case is far removed from the speech at issue in Garcetti — an internal memorandum prepared by a deputy district attorney for his supervisors recommending dismissal of a particular prosecution . The Garcetti Court held that such speech was made pursuant to the employee ’s “ official responsibilities ” because “ [ w]hen [ the employee ] went to work and performed the tasks he was paid to perform , [ he ] acted as a government employee . The fact that his duties sometimes required him to speak or write does not mean that his supervisors were prohib - ited from evaluating his performance . ” 547 U. S. , at 422 , 424 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
But Garcetti said nothing about speech that simply relates to public employment or concerns information learned in the course of public employment . The Garcetti Court made explicit that its holding did not turn on the fact that the memo at issue “ concerned the subject matter of [ the prosecutor ’s ] employment , ” because “ [ t]he First Amendment protects some expressions related to the speaker ’s job . ” Id. , at 421 . In other words , the mere fact that a citizen ’s speech concerns information acquired by virtue of his public employment does not transform that speech into employee — rather than citizen — speech . The critical question under Garcetti is whether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee ’s duties , not whether it merely concerns those duties .

It bears emphasis that our precedents dating back to Pickering have recognized that speech by public employees on subject matter related to their employment holdsspecial value precisely because those employees gainknowledge of matters of public concern through their employment . In Pickering , for example , the Court observed that “ [ t]eachers are . . . the members of a commu - nity most likely to have informed and definite opinions as to how funds allotted to the operation of the schools should be spent . Accordingly , it is essential that they be able to speak out freely on such questions without fear of retaliatory dismissal . ” 391 U. S. , at 572 ; see also Garcetti , 547 U. S. , at 421 ( recognizing that “ [ t]he same is true of many other categories of public employees ” ) . Most recently , in San Diego v. Roe , 543 U. S. , at 80 , the Court again observed that public employees “ are uniquely qualified to comment ” on “ matters concerning government policies that are of interest to the public at large . ”	@@empty@@	unmatched
The importance of public employee speech is especially evident in the context of this case : a public corruption scandal . The United States , for example , represents that because “ [ t]he more than 1000 prosecutions for federal corruption offenses that are brought in a typical year . . . often depend on evidence about activities that government officials undertook while in office , ” those prosecutions often “ require testimony from other government employees . ” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20 . It would be antithetical to our jurisprudence to conclude that the very kind of speech necessary to prosecute corruption by public officials — speech by public employees regarding information learned through their employment — may never form the basis for a First Amendment retaliation claim . Such a rule would place public employees who witness corruption in an impossible position , torn between the obligation to testify truthfully and the desire to avoid retaliation and keep their jobs .

Applying these principles , it is clear that Lane ’s sworn testimony is speech as a citizen .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Lane ’s testimony is also speech on a matter of public concern . Speech involves matters of public concern “ when it can ‘ be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political , social , or other concern to the community,’ or when it ‘ is a subject of legitimate news interest ; that is , a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public.’ ” Snyder v. Phelps , 562 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2011 ) ( slip op . , at 6–7 ) ( citation omitted ) . The inquiry turns on the “ content , form , and context ” of the speech . Connick , 461 U.

The content of Lane ’s testimony — corruption in a public program and misuse of state funds — obviously involves a matter of significant public concern . See , e.g. , Garcetti , 547 U. S. , at 425 ( “ Exposing governmental inefficiency and misconduct is a matter of considerable significance ” ) . And the form and context of the speech — sworn testimony in a judicial proceeding — fortify that conclusion . “ Unlike speech in other contexts , testimony under oath has the formality and gravity necessary to remind the witness that his or her statements will be the basis for official governmental action , action that often affects the rights and liberties of others . ” United States v. Alvarez , 567 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2012 ) ( slip op . , at 8–9 ) ( plurality opinion ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We hold , then , that Lane ’s truthful sworn testimony at Schmitz’ criminal trials is speech as a citizen on a matter of public concern .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This does not settle the matter , however . A public employee ’s sworn testimony is not categorically entitled to First Amendment protection simply because it is speech as a citizen on a matter of public concern . Under Pickering , if an employee speaks as a citizen on a matter of public concern , the next question is whether the government had “ an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the public ” based on the government ’s needs as an employer . Garcetti , 547 U. S. , at 418 .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
As discussed previously , we have recognized that government employers often have legitimate “ interest[s ] in the effective and efficient fulfillment of [ their ] responsibilities to the public , ” including “ ‘ promot[ing ] efficiency and integrity in the discharge of official duties,’ ” and “ ‘ maintain[ing ] proper discipline in public service.’ ” Connick , 461 U.

We have also cautioned , however , that “ a stronger showing [ of government interests ] may be necessary if the employee ’s speech more substantially involve[s ] matters of public concern . ” Id. , at 152 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Here , the employer ’s side of the Pickering scale is entirely empty : Respondents do not assert , and can not demonstrate , any government interest that tips the balance in their favor . There is no evidence , for example , that Lane ’s testimony at Schmitz’ trials was false or erroneous or that Lane unnecessarily disclosed any sensitive , confidential , or privileged information while testifying . 5 In these circumstances , we conclude that Lane ’s speech is entitled to protection under the First Amendment . The Eleventh Circuit erred in holding otherwise and dismissing Lane ’s claim of retaliation on that basis .

Respondent Franks argues that even if Lane ’s testimony is protected under the First Amendment , the claims against him in his individual capacity should be dismissed on the basis of qualified immunity . We agree .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
Qualified immunity “ gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open legal questions . ” Ashcroft v. al - Kidd , 563 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2011 ) ( slip op . , at 12 ) . Under this doctrine , courts may not award damages against a government official in his personal capacity unless “ the official violated a statutory or constitutional right , ” and “ the right was ‘ clearly established’ at the time of the challenged conduct . ” Id. , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 3 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The relevant question for qualified immunity purposes is this : Could Franks reasonably have believed , at the time he fired Lane , that a government employer could fire an employee on account of testimony the employee gave , under oath and outside the scope of his ordinary job responsibilities ? Eleventh Circuit precedent did not preclude Franks from reasonably holding that belief . And no decision of this Court was sufficiently clear to cast doubt on the controlling Eleventh Circuit precedent .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In dismissing Lane ’s claim , the Eleventh Circuit relied on its 1998 decision in Morris v. Crow , 142 F. 3d 1379 ( per curiam ) . There , a deputy sheriff sued the sheriff and two other officials , alleging that he had been fired in retaliation for statements he made in an accident report and later giving deposition testimony about his investigation of a fatal car crash between another officer and a citizen . Id. , at 1381 . In his accident report , the plaintiff noted that the officer was driving more than 130 mph in a 50 mph zone , without using his emergency blue warning light . See ibid . The plaintiff later testified to these facts at a deposition in a wrongful death suit against the sheriff ’s office . Ibid . His superiors later fired him . Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Eleventh Circuit , in a pre - Garcetti decision , concluded that the plaintiff ’s deposition testimony was unprotected . It held that a public employee ’s speech is protected only when it is “ ‘ made primarily in the employee ’s role as citizen,’ ” rather than “ ‘ primarily in the role of employee.’ ” Morris , 142 F. 3d , at 1382 . And it found the plaintiff ’s deposition testimony to be speech as an em - ployee because it “ reiterated the conclusions regardinghis observations of the accident ” that he “ generated in thenormal course of [ his ] duties . ” Ibid . Critically , the court acknowledged — and was unmoved by — the fact that al - though the plaintiff had investigated the accident andprepared the report pursuant to his official duties , there was no “ evidence that [ he ] gave deposition testimony for any reason other than in compliance with a subpoena to testify truthfully in the civil suit regarding the . . . accident . ” Ibid . The court further reasoned that the speech could not “ be characterized as an attempt to make public comment on sheriff ’s office policies and procedures , the internal workings of the department , the quality of its employees or upon any issue at all . ” Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Lane argues that two other Eleventh Circuit precedents put Franks on notice that his conduct violated the First Amendment : Martinez v. Opa - Locka , 971 F. 2d 708 ( 1992 ) ( per curiam ) , and Tindal v. Montgomery Cty . Comm’n , 32 F. 3d 1535 ( 1994 ) . Martinez involved a public employee ’s subpoenaed testimony before the Opa - Locka City Commission regarding her employer ’s procurement practices . 971 F. 2d , at 710 . The Eleventh Circuit held that her speech was protected , reasoning that it addressed a matter of public concern and that her interest in speaking freely was not outweighed by her employer ’s interest in providing government services . Id. , at 712 . It held , further , that the relevant constitutional rules were so clearly established at the time that qualified immunity did not apply . Id. , at 713 . Tindal , decided two years after Martinez , involved a public employee ’s subpoenaed testimony in her co - worker ’s sexual harassment lawsuit . 32 F. 3d , at 1537–1538 . The court again ruled in favor of the em - ployee . It held that the employee ’s speech touched upona public concern and that her employer had not offered any evidence that the speech hindered operations . Id.,at 1539–1540 .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
Morris , Martinez , and Tindal represent the landscape of Eleventh Circuit precedent the parties rely on for qualified immunity purposes . If Martinez and Tindal were controlling in the Eleventh Circuit in 2009 , we would agree with Lane that Franks could not reasonably have believed that it was lawful to fire Lane in retaliation for his testimony . But both cases must be read together with Morris , which reasoned — in declining to afford First Amendment protection — that the plaintiff ’s decision to testify was motivated solely by his desire to comply with a subpoena . The same could be said of Lane ’s decision to testify . Franks was thus entitled to rely on Morris when he fired Lane . 6	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
Lane argues that Morris is inapplicable because it distinguished Martinez , suggesting that Martinez survived Morris . See Morris , 142 F. 3d , at 1382–1383 . But this debate over whether Martinez or Morris applies to Lane ’s claim only highlights the dispositive point : At the time of Lane ’s termination , Eleventh Circuit precedent did not provide clear notice that subpoenaed testimony concerning information acquired through public employment is speech of a citizen entitled to First Amendment protection . At best , Lane can demonstrate only a discrepancy in Eleventh Circuit precedent , which is insufficient to defeat the defense of qualified immunity .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
Finally , Lane argues that decisions of the Third and Seventh Circuits put Franks on notice that his firing of Lane was unconstitutional . See Reilly , 532 F. 3d , at 231 ( CA3 ) ( truthful testimony in court is citizen speech protected by the First Amendment ) ; Morales v. Jones , 494 F. 3d 590 , 598 ( CA7 2007 ) ( similar ) . But , as the court below acknowledged , those precedents were in direct conflict with Eleventh Circuit precedent . See 523 Fed . Appx . , at 712 , n. 3 .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
There is no doubt that the Eleventh Circuit incorrectly concluded that Lane ’s testimony was not entitled to First Amendment protection . But because the question was not “ beyond debate ” at the time Franks acted , al - Kidd , 563 U. S. , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 9 ) , Franks is entitled to qualified immunity .	@@empty@@	unmatched

This case presents the discrete question whether a public employee speaks “ as a citizen on a matter of public concern , ” Garcetti v. Ceballos , 547 U. S. 410 , 418 ( 2006 ) , when the employee gives “ [ t]ruthful testimony under oath . . . outside the scope of his ordinary job duties , ” ante , at 9 . Answering that question requires little more than a straightforward application of Garcetti . There , we held that when a public employee speaks “ pursuant to ” his official duties , he is not speaking “ as a citizen , ” and First Amendment protection is unavailable . 547 U. S. , at 421–422 . The petitioner in this case did not speak “ pursuant to ” his ordinary job duties because his responsibilities did not include testifying in court proceedings , see ante , at 8 , n. 4 , and no party has suggested that he was subpoenaed as a representative of his employer , see Fed . Rule Civ . Proc . 30(b)(6 ) ( requiring subpoenaed organizations to designate witnesses to testify on their behalf ) . Because petitioner did not testify to “ fulfil[l ] a [ work ] responsibility , ” Garcetti , supra , at 421 , he spoke “ as a citizen , ” not as an employee .

We accordingly have no occasion to address the quite different question whether a public employee speaks “ as a citizen ” when he testifies in the course of his ordinary job responsibilities . See ante , at 8 , n. 4 . For some public employees — such as police officers , crime scene technicians , and laboratory analysts — testifying is a routine and critical part of their employment duties . Others may be called to testify in the context of particular litigation as the designated representatives of their employers . See Fed . Rule Civ . Proc . 30(b)(6 ) . The Court properly leaves the constitutional questions raised by these scenarios for another day .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Employers must pay Federal Insurance Contribution Act taxes ( popularly known as Social Security taxes or FICA taxes ) , calculated as a percentage of the wagesincluding the tipsthat their employees receive . 26 U. S. C. § § 3101(q ) . This case focuses upon the Governments efforts to assess a restaurant for FICA taxes based upon tips that its employees may have received but did not report . We must decide whether the law authorizes the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) to base that assessment upon its aggregate estimate of all the tips that the restaurants customers paid its employees , or whether the law requires the IRS instead to determine total tip income by estimating each individual employees tip income separately , then adding individual estimates together to create a total . In our view , the law authorizes the IRS to use the aggregate estimation method .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The tax law imposes , not only on employees , but also on every employer, an excise tax, i.e . , a FICA tax , in an amount equal to a percentage of the wages … paid by him with respect to employment. § 3111(a ) ( setting forth basic Social Security tax ) ; § 3111(b ) ( using identical language to set forth additional hospital insurance tax ) . It specifies that tips received by an employee in the course of his employment shall be considered remuneration and deemed to have been paid by the employer for purposes of the FICA tax sections . § 3121(q ) . It also requires an employee who receives wages in the form of tips to report the amount of those tips to the employer , who must send copies of those reports to the IRS . 26 CFR § 31.6011(a)1(a ) ( 2001 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In 1991 and 1992 the reports provided to San Franciscos Fior DItalia restaurant ( and ultimately to the IRS ) by the restaurants employees showed that total tip income amounted to $ 247,181 and $ 220,845 , in each year respectively . And Fior DItalia calculated and paid its FICA tax based on these amounts . The same reports , however , also showed that customers had listed tips on their credit card slips amounting to far more than the amount reported by the employees ( $ 364,786 in 1991 and $ 338,161 in 1992 ) . Not surprisingly , this discrepancy led the IRS to conduct a compliance check . And that check led the IRS to issue an assessment against Fior DItalia for additional FICA tax .	@@empty@@	unmatched
To calculate the added tax it found owing , the IRS used what it calls an aggregate estimation method . That method was a very simple one . The IRS examined the restaurants credit card slips for the years in question , finding that customers had tipped , on average , 14.49 % of their bills in 1991 and 14.29 % in 1992 . Assuming that cash - paying customers on average tipped at those rates also , the IRS calculated total tips by multiplying the tip rates by the restaurants total receipts . It then subtracted tips already reported and applied the FICA tax rate to the remainder . The results for 1991 showed total tips amounting to $ 403,726 and unreported tips amounting to $ 156,545 . The same figures for 1992 showed $ 368,374 and $ 147,529 . The IRS issued an assessment against Fior DItalia for additional FICA taxes owed , amounting to $ 11,976 for 1991 and $ 11,286 for 1992 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
After paying a portion of the taxes assessed , the restaurant brought this refund suit , while the IRS filed a counterclaim for the remainder . The restaurant argued that the tax statutes did not authorize the IRS to use its aggregate estimation method ; rather , they required the IRS first to determine the tips that each individual employee received and then to use that information to calculate the employers total FICA tax liability . Simplifying the case , the restaurant agreed that [f]or purpose[s ] of this litigation, it would not dispute the facts , estimates and/or determinations that the IRS had used … as a basis for its calculation of the employees aggregate unreported tip income. App . 35 . And the District Court decided the sole remaining legal questionthe question of the statutory authority to estimate tip income in the aggregatein Fior DItalias favor .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court by a vote of 2 to 1 , the majority concluding that the IRS is not legally authorized to use its aggregate estimation method , at least not without first adopting its own authorizing regulation .

An assessment amounts to an IRS determination that a taxpayer owes the Federal Government a certain amount of unpaid taxes . It is well established in the tax law that an assessment is entitled to a legal presumption of correctnessa presumption that can help the Government prove its case against a taxpayer in court . See , e.g . , United States v. Janis , 428 U. S. 433 , 440 ( 1976 ) ; Palmer v. IRS , 116 F. 3d 1309 , 1312 ( CA9 1997 ) ; Psaty v.

This provision , by granting the IRS assessment authority , must simultaneously grant the IRS power to decide how to make that assessmentat least within certain limits .

Fior DItalia does not challenge this basic principle of law . Rather , it seeks to explain why this principle should not apply here , or why it should not determine the outcome of this case in the Governments favor .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Fior DItalias primary argument rests upon the statute that imposes the FICA tax . It points out that the tax law says there is imposed on every employer an excise tax calculated on the basis of wages … paid by him as those  wages  are  defined in § 3121 . § § 3111(a ) , ( b ) . It adds that the subsection of § 3121 which specifies that wages includes tips ( subsection q ) refers to tips as those received by an employee in the course of his employment, i.e. , to tips received by each employee individually . ( Emphasis added . ) Fior DItalia emphasizes § 3121(q)s reference to the employee in the singular to conclude that the employers liability for FICA taxes therefore attaches to each of these individual payments , not when they are later summed and reported. Brief for Respondent 28 ( emphasis in original ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In our view Fior DItalias linguistic argument makes too much out of too little . The language it finds key , the words tips received by an employee is contained in a definitional section , § 3121(q ) , not in the sections that impose the tax , § § 3111(a ) , ( b ) . The definitional section speaks in the singular . It says that an employees ( singular ) tips shall be considered remuneration for purposes of the latter , tax imposing sections . § 3121(q ) . But the latter operational sections speak in the plural . They impose on employers a FICA tax calculated as a percentage of the wages ( plural ) paid to individuals ( plural ) by the employer with respect to employment. § § 3111(a ) , ( b ) . The operational sections consequently impose liability for the totality of the wages that the employer pays , which totality of wages, says the definitional section , shall include the tips that each individual employee earns . It is as if a tax were imposed on all of a restaurants dishes, with a definitional section specifying that dishes shall include each customers silverware. We simply do not see how this kind of language , taken as a whole , argues against use of an aggregate estimation method that seeks to determine the restaurants total FICA tax liability .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Ninth Circuit relied in part upon two other statutory provisions . The first , 26 U. S. C. § 446(b ) , has been interpreted to authorize the IRS to use methods of estimation for determining income tax liability . See , e.g. , Mendelson , supra , at 521522 ( authorizing estimate of waitress gross receipts ) . The court felt this provision negatively implies a lack of IRS authority to use the aggregate estimation method in respect to other taxes , such as employer FICA taxes , where no such provision applies . 242 F. 3d , at 849 . The second , 26 U. S. C. § 6205(a)(1 ) , authorizes the Secretary to adopt regulations that prescribe mechanisms for employers to adjust FICA tax liability . The court felt this provision negatively implies a lack of IRS authority to use an aggregate estimation method in the absence of a regulation . 242 F. 3d , at 851 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
After examining the statutes , however , we can not find any negative implication . The first says that , where a taxpayer has used a method of accounting that does not clearly reflect income, or has used no method of accounting at all , the computation of taxable income shall be made under such method as , in the opinion of the Secretary , does clearly reflect income. § 446(b ) . This provision applies to only one corner of income tax law , and even within that corner it says nothing about any particular method of calculation . To read it negatively would significantly limit IRS authority in that respect both within and outside the field of income tax law . And there is simply no reason to believe that Congress intended any such limitation .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Section 6205(a)(1 ) refers to certain employment taxes , including FICA taxes , and says that when an employer initially pays less than the correct amount of tax, then proper adjustments … shall be made , without interest, in accordance with regulations. The IRS has made clear that this provision refers to an employers adjustments, say , in an initially underreported tax liability , made before the IRS has assessed an underpayment . See generally 26 CFR § 31.62051 ( 2001 ) . Again , there is simply no reason to believe that Congress , in writing this provision applicable to a small corner of tax law , intended , through negative implication , to limit the IRS general power to assess tax deficiencies . Indeed , Fior DItalia has not advanced in this Court either negative implication argument relied on by the Ninth Circuit .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Fior DItalia next points to several features of an aggregate estimate that , in its view , make it unreasonable ( and therefore contrary to law ) for the IRS to use that method . First , it notes that an aggregate estimate will sometimes include tips that should not count in calculating the FICA tax the employer owes . The law excludes an employees tips from the FICA wages base insofar as those tips amount to less than $ 20 in a month . 26 U. S. C. § 3121(a)(12)(B ) . It also excludes the portion of tips and other wages ( including fixed salary ) an employee receives that rises above a certain annual level$53,400 in 1991 and $ 55,500 in 1992 . § 3121(a)(1 ) ; 242 F. 3d , at 846 , n. 4 . These ceilings mean that if a waiter earns , say , $ 36,000 in fixed salary , reports $ 20,000 in tips , and fails to report $ 10,000 in tips , the restaurant would not owe additional taxes , because the waiters reported income ( $ 56,000 ) already exceeds the FICA ceiling . But if that waiter earns $ 36,000 in fixed salary , reports $ 10,000 in tips , and fails to report another $ 10,000 in tips , the restaurant would owe additional taxes on the unreported amount , because the waiters reported income of $ 46,000 falls below the FICA ceiling .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Second , Fior DItalia points out that an aggregate calculation based on credit card slips can overstate the aggregate amount of tips because it fails to account for the possibilities that : ( 1 ) customers who pay cash tend to leave a lower percentage of the bill as a tip ; ( 2 ) some customers stiff the waiter , leaving no tip at all ; ( 3 ) some customers write a high tip on the credit card slip , but ask for some cash back , leaving a net lower amount ; and ( 4 ) some restaurants deduct the credit card company fee from the tip , leaving the employees with a lower net amount .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Fior DItalia adds that these potential errors can make an enormous difference to a restaurant , for restaurant profits are often low , while the tax is high . Brief for Respondent 910 , n. 6 ( asserting that an assessment for unreported tips for all years since employer FICA tax provision was enacted would amount to two years total profits ) . Indeed , the restaurant must pay this tax on the basis of amounts that the restaurant itself can not control , for the restaurants customers , not the restaurant itself , determine the level of tips . Fior DItalia concludes that the IRS should avoid these problems by resting its assessment upon individual calculations of employee tip earnings , and argues that the IRS failure to do so will always result in an overstatement of tax liability , rendering any assessment that results from aggregate estimates unreasonable and outside the limits of any delegated IRS authority .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In our view , these considerations do not show that the IRS aggregate estimating method falls outside the bounds of what is reasonable . It bears repeating that in this litigation , Fior DItalia stipulated that it would not challenge the particular IRS calculation as inaccurate . Absent such a stipulation , a taxpayer would remain free to present evidence that an assessment is inaccurate in a particular case . And we do not accept Fior DItalias claim that restaurants are unable to do sothat they simply do not have the information to dispute the IRS assessment . Tr . of Oral Arg . 36 . Why does a restaurant owner not know , or why is that owner unable to find out : how many busboys or other personnel work for only a day or twothereby likely earning less than $ 20 in tips ; how many employees were likely to have earned more than $ 55,000 or so in 1992 ; how much less cash - paying customers tip ; how often they stiff waiters or ask for a cash refund ; and whether the restaurant owner deducts a credit card charge of , say 3 % , from employee tips ? After all , the restaurant need not prove these matters with precision . It need only demonstrate that use of the aggregate method in the particular case has likely produced an inaccurate result . And in doing so , it may well be able to convince a judge to insist upon a more accurate formula . See , e.g. , Erickson , 937 F. 2d , at 1551 (  Some reasonable foundation for the assessment is necessary to preserve the presumption of correctness ( emphasis in original ) ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Nor has Fior DItalia convinced us that individualized employee assessments will inevitably lead to a more reasonable assessment of employer liability than an aggregate estimate . After all , individual audits will be plagued by some of the same inaccuracies Fior DItalia attributes to the aggregate estimation method , because they are , of course , based on estimates themselves . See , e.g. , Mendelson , 305 F. 2d , at 521522 ; McQuatters v. Commissioner , CCH TCM 1122 ( 1973 ) . Consequently , we can not find that the aggregate method is , as a general matter , so unreasonable as to violate the law .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Fior DItalia also mentions an IRS regulation that it believes creates a special problem of fairness when taken together with the aggregate assessment method . That regulation says that an employer , when calculating its FICA tax , must include wages received by an employee in the form of tips only to the extent of the tips reported … to the employer. 26 CFR § 31.6011(a)1(a ) ( 2001 ) ( emphasis added ) . How , then , asks Fior DItalia , could the employer have calculated tax on a different amount , namely : ( 1 ) the amount of tips reported ; plus ( 2 ) the amount of tips received but not reported ? Indeed , Fior DItalia itself did not do so initially , presumably because this regulation said it should not do so . See Brief for Respondent 1617 . And , if it should not do so , is it not seriously unfair for the IRS later to assess against it a tax deficiency based on this latter figure ? [T]here is no practical or legally authorized way, Fior DItalia complains , for the restaurant to include the additional amount of tips for which the IRS might later seek tax payment . I d . , at 16 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The statute itself , however , responds to this concern . It says that , insofar as tips were received but not reported to the employer , that remuneration ( i.e. , the unreported tips ) shall not be deemed to have been paid by the employer until the date on which notice and demand for such taxes is made to the employer by the Secretary. 26 U. S. C. § 3121(q ) . This provision makes clear that it is not unfair or illegal to assess a tax deficiency on the unreported tips , for penalties will not attach and interest will not accrue unless the IRS actually demands the money and the restaurant refuses subsequently to pay the amount demanded in a timely fashion . See generally , Rev. Rul . 957 , 19954 I. R. B. 44 . Indeed , the statute ( and its accompanying Revenue Ruling ) contemplates both a restaurant that does not police employee tip reporting and a later assessment based on unreported tips . It makes clear that , at most , such a restaurant would have to create a reserve for potential later tax liability . Although the reporting scheme may place restaurants in an awkward position , the Tax Code seems to contemplate that position ; and its bookkeeping awkwardness consequently fails to support the argument that aggregate estimation is unlawful .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Finally , Fior DItalia suggests that the IRS is putting its aggregate estimate method to improper use . It traces a lengthy history of disagreement among restaurant workers , restaurant owners , and the IRS as to how best to enforce the restaurants legal obligation to pay FICA taxes on unreported tip income . It notes that the IRS has agreed to create a special program , called the Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment, whereby a restaurant promises to establish accurate tip reporting procedures in return for an IRS promise to base FICA tax liability on reported tips alone . It adds that any coercion used to force a restaurant to enter such a program ( often unpopular with employees ) would conflict with the views of Members of Congress and IRS officials , who have said that a restaurant should not be held responsible for its employees failure to report all their tips as income . See , e.g. , Letter of Members of Congress to Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen , 32 Tax Analysts Daily Tax Highlights & Documents 3913 ( Mar. 4 , 1994 ) ; App . 106 , 107 . It adds that Congress has enacted this view into two special laws : the first of which gives restaurants a nonrefundable tax credit on FICA taxes paid , i.e. , permits restaurants to offset any FICA it pays on employee tips on a dollar for dollar basis against its own income tax liability , 26 U. S. C. § 45B ; and the second of which forbids the IRS from threaten[ing ] to audit a restaurant in order to coerce it into entering the special tip - reporting program . Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 , 112Stat . 755 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Fior DItalia says that the IRS recent use of an aggregate estimate approach runs contrary to the understanding that underlies this second statute , for it effectively forces the employer into … verifying , investigating , monitoring , and policing compliance by its employeesresponsibilities which Congress and the Courts have considered , evaluated , and steadfastly refused to transfer from IRS to the employer. Brief for Respondent 9 . And it suggests that the IRS intends to use a legal victory here as a threat, say to reopen back tax years , in order to require restaurant owners to force their employees to report all tips . I d . , at 14 . Why else , asks Fior DItalia , would the IRS bring this case ? After all , given the dollar for dollar FICA / income tax setoff , this case may not even produce revenue for the Government .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Fior DItalias abuse of power argument , however , does not constitute a ground for holding unlawful the IRS use of aggregate estimates . Even if we assume , for arguments sake , that an improper motive could render unlawful the use of a statutorily permissible enforcement method in certain circumstances , cf . United States v. Powell , 379 U. S. 48 , 58 ( 1964 ) , we note that Fior DItalia has not demonstrated that the IRS has acted illegally in this case . Instead it has presented a general claim to the effect that the aggregate estimation method lends itself to abusive agency action . But we can not find agency action unreasonable in all cases simply because of a general possibility of abusea possibility that exists in respect to many discretionary enforcement powers . Cf . Heckler v. Chaney , 470 U. S. 821 , 831 ( 1985 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The statutes and congressional documents that protect restaurants from onerous monitoring requirements consequently do not support Fior DItalias argument that aggregate estimates are statutorily prohibited . For example , the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act prohibits the IRS from threaten[ing ] to audit restaurants as a means to coerce them into policing employee tip reporting , supra , at 12 , but Fior DItalia does not claim that the IRS has violated this statute . Nor , for that matter , has Fior DItalia presented evidence that this particular litigation would fail to yield revenue to the Government ( due to the availability of the FICA tax credit ) , or convincingly explained , even if so , why that fact , while making the case unremunerative , would automatically make it improper . And while other documents show that Congress has expressed concern regarding a restaurants difficulty in trying to supervise its employees reporting of their tips , they do not suggest that the aggregate estimate method is an unreasonable way of ascertaining unpaid FICA taxes for which the employer is indisputably liable ( particularly when one recalls that the taxpayer generally remains free to challenge the accuracy of the calculation at issue , even though this taxpayer has waived its right to do so ) . Rather , as we have shown , the relevant Code provisions and case law support the use of aggregate estimates . See supra , at 35 , 911 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We conclude that Fior DItalias discussion of IRS abuse is insufficient to show that the agencys use of aggregate estimates is prohibited by law . In saying this , we recognize that Fior DItalia remains free to make its policy - related arguments to Congress .	@@empty@@	unmatched
For these reasons , and because Fior DItalia has stipulated that it does not challenge the accuracy of the IRS assessment in this case , the decision of the Court of Appeals is	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court holds that the Internal Revenue Services statutory authorization to make assessments for unpaid taxes is reasonably read to cover a restaurateurs FICA taxes based on an aggregate estimate of all unreported employee tips . I believe that reading the statute so broadly saddles employers with a burden unintended by Congress , and I respectfully dissent .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Taxes on earned income imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act ( FICA ) pay for employees benefits under the Social Security Act , 49Stat . 622 , as amended , 42 U. S. C. § 401 et seq . ( 1994 ed . and Supp . V ) . In the simplest case , the employee is taxed on what he receives , and the employer is taxed on what he pays . See 26 U. S. C. § § 3101 . For a long time , an employees income from tips was not recognized as remuneration paid by the employer , and the corresponding FICA tax was imposed only on the employee . See Social Security Amendments of 1965 , § 313(c ) , 79Stat . 382 . In 1987 , however , the Internal Revenue Code was amended to treat tip income within the remuneration on which the employer , too , is taxed , 26 U. S. C. § 3121(q ) , and that is the present law .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The scheme is simple . The tips are includible in the employees wages . The employee must report the amount of taxable tip income to the employer . § 6053(a ) . [L]arge food or beverage establishment[s] must pass on that information to the Internal Revenue Service , § 6053(c)(1 ) , and must also report the total amount of tips shown on credit card slips . Ibid . The employer is subject to tax on the same amount of tip income listed on an employees report to him and in turn reported by him to the Internal Revenue Service . For both the employer and the employee , however , taxable tip income is limited to income within what is known as the wage band ; there is no tax on tips that amount to less than $ 20 in a given month , or on total remuneration in excess of the Social Security wage base ( $ 53,400 and $ 55,500 , respectively , in the years relevant to this case ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Because many employees report less tip income than they receive , their FICA taxes and their employers matching amounts are less than they would be in a world of complete reporting . The IRS has chosen to counter dishonesty on the part of restaurant employees not by moving directly against them , but by going against their employers with assessments of unpaid FICA taxes based on an estimate of all tip income paid to all employees aggregated together . The Court finds these aggregated assessments authorized by the general provision for assessments of unpaid taxes , § 6201 , which benefits the Government with a presumption of correctness . See United States v. Janis , 428 U. S. 433 , 440 ( 1976 ) . 1 The practice of assessing FICA taxes against an employer on estimated aggregate tip income , however , raises anomaly after anomaly , to the point that one has to suspect that the Governments practice is wrong . An appreciation of these consequences , in fact , calls for a reading of the crucial provision , 26 U. S. C. § 3121(q ) , in a straightforward way , which bars aggregate assessments and the anomalies that go with them .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Social Security scheme of benefits and the FICA tax funding it have been characterized as a kind of social insurance, Flemming v. Nestor , 363 U. S. 603 , 609 ( 1960 ) , in which employers and employees contribute matching amounts . Compare 26 U. S. C. § 3101 with § 3111 . The payments that beneficiaries are entitled to receive are determined by the records of their wages earned . Nestor , supra , at 608 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Notwithstanding this basic structure , the IRSs aggregate estimation method creates a disjunction between amounts presumptively owed by an employer and those owed by an employee . It creates a comparable disproportion between the employers tax and the employees ultimate benefits , since an aggregate assessment does nothing to revise the earnings records of the individual employees for whose benefit the taxes are purportedly collected . 2 Thus , from the outset , the aggregate assessment fits poorly with the design of the system .	@@empty@@	unmatched
As the majority acknowledges , the next problem is that the aggregate estimation necessarily requires the use of generalized assumptions for calculating such estimates , and the assumptions actually used tend to inflate liability . In the first place , while the IRSs assumption that many employees are underreporting is indisputably sound , the assumption that every patron is not only tipping , but tipping 14.49 % in 1991 and 14.29 % in 1992 , is probably not . Those percentages are based on two further assumptions : that patrons who pay with credit cards tip at the same rate as patrons who pay in cash , and that all patrons use the tip line of the credit card slip for tips , rather than to obtain cash . But what is most significant is that the IRSs method of aggregate estimation ignores the wage band entirely , assuming that all tips are subject to FICA tax , although this is not true in law , and certainly not always the case in fact .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The tendency of the Governments aggregation method to overestimate liability might not count much against it if it were fair to expect employers to keep the reports that would carry their burden to refute any contested assessment based on an aggregate estimate . But it is not fair .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Obviously , the only way an employer can refute probable inflation by estimate is to keep track of every employees tips , ante , at 9 , and at first blush , there might seem nothing unusual about expecting employers to do this . 3 The Code imposes a general obligation upon all taxpayers to keep records relevant to their liability according to regulations promulgated by the Secretary , 26 U. S. C. § 6001 , and , for the most part , the courts have viewed the burden on taxpayers to maintain such records as reasonable and , hence , as the justification for requiring taxpayers to disprove IRS estimates ; the taxpayer who fails to attend to § 6001 has only himself to blame . See , e.g. , Kikalos v. Commissioner , 190 F. 3d 791 , 792 , n. 1 ( CA7 1999 ) ; Cracchiola v. Commissioner , 643 F.2d 1383 , 1385 ( CA9 1981 ) ; Meneguzzo v. Commissioner , 43 TC 824 , 831 ( 1965 ) . 4 But the first blush ignores the one feature of § 6001 relevant here . The provision states a single , glaring exception : employers need not keep records in connection with charged tips other than charge receipts , records necessary to comply with section 6053(c ) , and copies of statements furnished by employees under section 6053(a). Ibid . Employers are expressly excused from any effort to determine whether employees are properly reporting their tips ; the Code tells them that they need not keep the information specific to each employee that would be necessary to determine if any tips fell short of the estimates or outside the wage band . 5 Presumably because of this statutory exception , the Secretarys regulations regarding employer recordkeeping do not impose any obligations beyond those mentioned in § 6001 . See 26 CFR § 31.60015 ( 2001 ) ( describing required records ) . This absolution from recordkeeping is mirrored by the fact that tips are uniquely excepted from the general rule that remuneration must be reported in W2 statements . See 26 U. S. C. § 6041(e ) . The upshot is that Congress has enacted a singular exception to the duty to keep records that would allow any ready wage band determinations or other checks on estimates , while the aggregate assessment practice of the IRS virtually reads the exception out of the Code .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The majority doubts that there is any practical difference between determining the liability of one employee , very possibly with an estimation similar to the one used here , and estimating the aggregate amount for an employer . Ante , at 910 . But determinations limited to an individual employee will necessarily be more tailored , if only by taking the wage band into account . In fact , any such determination would occur in consequence of some audit of the employee , who would have an incentive to divulge information to contest the IRSs figures where possible , and generate the very paper trail an employer would need to contest liability while availing himself of the exception in § 6001 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The strangeness of combining a statute excusing employers from recordkeeping with an administrative practice of making probably inflated assessments stands out even more starkly in light of the eccentric route the Government has to follow in a case like this in order to benefit from the presumption of correctness that an aggregate assessment carries . Under the general authorization to make assessments , 26 U. S. C. § 6201 , on which the Government relies , any assessment is preceded by liability for taxes . § 6201(a ) ( The Secretary is authorized … to make the inquiries , determinations , and assessments of all taxes … which have not been duly paid …  ) ; ante , at 3 ( An assessment amounts to an IRS determination that a taxpayer owes the Federal Government a certain amount of unpaid taxes  ) . After , but only after , assessment can the IRS take the further step of issuing notice and demand for the unpaid taxes assessed , § 6303 , so as to authorize the IRS to levy upon the taxpayers property , or impose liens , § § 6321 , 6331 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In the case of an employers liability for FICA taxes on tips , however , this sequence can not be followed if the employee does not report the tips to the employer in the first place , for it is the report , not the employees receipt of the tips , that raises the employers liability to pay the FICA tax . The employer may know from the credit slips that the employees reports are egregiously inaccurate ( wage band or no wage band ) , but the employer is still liable only on what the employee declares . In fact , the effect of § 6053(c ) is such that employers can not help but know when underreporting is severe , since they are required to give the IRS a summary of the amount of reported tips and the amount of charged tips . Nonetheless , the employer remains liable solely for taxes on the reported tips . 6	@@empty@@	unmatched
Indeed , even if the employer , seeing a disparity , paid extra FICA taxes on the assumption that the employees had underreported tips , the extra payment would be treated as an overpayment . See Tr . of Oral Arg . 8 ; Jones v. Liberty Glass Co. , 332 U. S. 524 , 531 ( 1947 ) ( overpayment is any payment in excess of that which is properly due ) . The overall implication is that employers are meant to pay taxes based on specific information provided by others . As a practical matter , the tips themselves are not the true basis for liability ; instead , it is an employee report that creates the obligation .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Some event must therefore trigger liability for taxes on unreported tips before the IRS can make the assessment , and this event turns out to be the notice and demand for which § 3121(q ) makes special provision in such a case . 7 Only after notice and demand can the Government proceed to assessment under § 6201 . Whereas the usual sequence is assessment , then notice and demand , see 26 U. S. C. § 6303 , here it is notice and demand , then assessment .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The IRS does not dispute this . It concedes that it does not rely upon § 6201 before issuing the notice , see Reply Brief for United States 1516 , but instead performs a pre - assessment estimate ( for which , incidentally , no statutory authorization exists ) . Then it issues notice and ( liability having now attached ) uses the same estimate for the official assessment under § 6201 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Again , at first blush , it is tempting to say that the sequence of events may be unusual , but under the aggregate assessment practice the employer - taxpayer ends up in the same position he would have been in if he failed to pay FICA taxes on reported tips . But there are two very significant differences . It is true that the employer who is delinquent as to reported tips ends up subject to liability on the basis of third - party action ( the employees report ) which assessment invests with a presumption of correctness , and which notice and demand then make a basis for possible liens and levies . But in that case the employers liability , and exposure to collection mechanisms , is subject to the important safeguard of the employees report . Whatever the employee may do , it will not be in his interest to report more tips than he received , exposing himself ( and , incidentally , his employer ) to extra taxation . But this safeguard is entirely lost to the employer , through no fault of his own , if the Government can make aggregate assessments . The innocent employer has few records and no protection derived from the employees interest . Yet without any such protection he is , on the Governments theory , immediately liable for the consequences of notice and demand at the very instant liability arises .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The second difference goes to the authority for estimating liability . The IRS finds this authority implicit in § 6201 , which authorizes assessments . Ante , at 4 . In the usual case , the estimate is thus made in calculating the assessment , which occurs after the event that creates the liability being estimated and assessed . But in the case of the tips unreported by the employee , there would be no liability until notice and demand is made under § 3121(q ) , and it is consequently at this point that the estimate is required . The upshot is that the estimate has to occur before the statute claimed to authorize it , § 6201 , is even applicable . That is , the IRS says it can estimate because it can assess , and it can assess because it can previously estimate . Reasoning this circular may warrant suspicion .	@@empty@@	unmatched
There is one more source of suspicion . In 1993 , Congress enacted an income tax credit for certain employers in the amount of FICA taxes paid on tips in excess of the minimum wage . 26 U. S. C. § 45B. The existence of the credit creates a peculiar scheme , for unless we are to assume that restaurateurs are constantly operating on the knife - edge of solvency , never able to use the credit ( even with its 20-year carryforward , see 26 U. S. C. § 39 ) , the IRS has little reason to expect to gain much from the employer - taxpayer ; the collection effort will probably result in no net benefit to the Government ( except , perhaps , as an interest - free loan ) . 8 And because , as noted , the aggregate method chosen by the IRS will not affect individual employees wage - earning records , the estimates do not even play much of a bookkeeping role . There is something suspect , then , in the IRSs insistence on conducting audits of employers , without corresponding audits of employees , for the purpose of collecting FICA taxes that will ultimately be refunded , that do not increase the accuracy of individual earnings records , and probably overestimate the true amount of taxable earnings .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In fact , the only real advantage to the IRS seems to be that the threat of audit , litigation , and immediate liability may well force employers to assume the job of monitoring their employees tips to ensure accurate reporting . But if that explanation for the Governments practice makes sense of it , it also flips the Government from the frying pan into the fire . Congress has previously stymied every attempt the IRS has made to impose such a burden on employers . In the days when employers were responsible only for withholding the employees share of the FICA tax , the IRS attempted to force employers to include tip income on W2 forms ; this effort was blocked when Congress modified 26 U. S. C. § 6041 to exclude tip income expressly from the W2 requirements . See Revenue Act of 1978 , § 501(b ) , 92Stat . 2878 . When the IRS interpreted the credit available under § 45B to apply only to tips reported by the employee pursuant to 26 U. S. C. § 6053(a ) , Congress overruled the IRS and clarified that the credit would apply to all FICA taxes paid on tips above those used to satisfy the employers minimum wage obligations . See Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 , Pub . L. No . 104188 , § 1112(a ) , 110Stat . 1759 . Finally , when the IRS developed its Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment ( TRAC ) program , ante , at 1112 , Congress forbade the IRS from threaten[ing ] to audit any taxpayer in an attempt to coerce the taxpayer into participating . Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 , § 3414 , 112Stat . 755 . 9 And although the use of a threatened aggregate estimate ( after an audit ) to induce monitoring of employee tips may not technically run afoul of that statute , it is difficult to imagine that Congress would allow the aggregation practice as a lever on employers , when it forbade the use of an audit for the same purpose .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Consider an alternative . I have noted already that even the Government tacitly acknowledges the crucial role of § 3121(q ) , the source of its authority to issue notice and demand , without which there is no liability on the employers part for FICA taxes on unreported tips and thus no possibility of assessment under § 6201 . It makes sense , then , to understand the scope of authority to make the assessment as being limited by the scope of the authority to issue notice and demand , and it likewise makes sense to pay close attention to the text of that authorization .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The special provision in § 3121(q ) for notice and demand against an employer says nothing and suggests nothing about aggregate assessments . It reads that when an employer was furnished no statement including such tips or was given an inaccurate or incomplete one , the remuneration in the form of such tips shall be treated as if paid on the date notice and demand is made to the employer . 26 U. S. C. § 3121(q ) . [S]uch tips are described as tips received by an employee in the course of his employment. Ibid . Thus , by its terms , the statute provides for notice and demand for the tax on the tips of an employee, not on the tips of employees or all employees aggregated together . And , of course , if notice and demand is limited to taxes on tips of an employee, that is the end of aggregate estimates .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is true that under the Dictionary Act , 1 U. S. C. § 1 , a statutory provision in the singular may include the plural where that would work in the context . Ibid . [A]n employee could cover employees and the notice and demand could cover tips received during their employment, unless the context indicates otherwise, ibid . But here the context does indicate otherwise . The anomalies I have pointed out occur when the singular employee in § 3121(q ) is read to include the plural , which in turn is crucial to allowing aggregate notice , demand , and assessment ; and it turns out that reading the statute to refer only to a particular employees tips and limiting notice , demand , and assessment accordingly , goes far to abridge the catalog of oddities that come with the Governments position .	@@empty@@	unmatched
First , sticking to the singular means that the employer will not be assessed more tax than the employee himself should pay ; whether or not the employee is sued for a like amount , the respective liabilities of employer and employee will be restored to parity . And by keying the employers liability to a particular employee , the near - certainty of overassessment will be replaced with a likelihood of an accurate assessment taking into consideration the wage band of taxability under FICA .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Second , the fact that the employer has exercised his express , statutory option to decline to keep tipping records on his work force will no longer place him at such an immediate disadvantage . It will be relatively easy to discover the basis for the tax calculation in a particular instance .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Third , if indeed the Government first establishes the employees liability for unreported tips , notice and demand under § 3121(q ) will then serve what on its face seems to be its obvious purpose , to provide the employer with reliable information , like the employee tip reports that similarly trigger liability , so that the employer will have no further need for keeping track of employee tips . Although this is not the time to decide whether the IRS must formally audit the employees own tax liability first , there is at least one reason to think Congress assumed that it would . There is no statute of limitations on an employers FICA tax liability for unreported tips ( because the statute does not run until after liability attaches , and no time limits are imposed upon the issuance of the notice that triggers liability ) . But there is a statute of limitations for assessments against employees . 26 U. S. C. § 6501 . Conditioning the employers liability on a parallel obligation of the employee would in effect place a limitation period on the employers exposure .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Finally , of course , the tension with Congresss admonition that the IRS not threaten to audit any taxpayer in an attempt to coerce the taxpayer into participating in TRAC will be eliminated . If the employer is liable only after an individual employees delinquency has been calculated , the use of mass assessments to force an employer , in self - defense , to institute TRAC will simply vanish .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Thus , the context establishes that a singular reading is the one that makes sense by eliminating the eccentricities entailed by the aggregate reading , some of which seem unfair to employer taxpayers . Of course , this means that the problem of underreporting tips will be harder to solve , but it seems clear that Congress did not mean to solve it by allowing the IRS to use its assessment power to shift the problem to employers . I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Respondent paraplegics filed this action for damages and equitable relief , alleging that Tennessee and a number of its counties had denied them physical access to that States courts in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ( ADA ) , which provides : [N]o qualified individual with a disability shall , by reason of such disability , be excluded from participation or denied the benefits of the services , programs or activities of a public entity, 42 U. S. C. § 12132 . After the District Court denied the States motion to dismiss on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds , the Sixth Circuit held the appeal in abeyance pending Board of Trustees of Univ . of Ala. v. Garrett , 531 U. S. 356 . This Court later ruled in Garrett that the Eleventh Amendment bars private money damages actions for state violations of ADA Title I , which prohibits employment discrimination against the disabled . The en banc Sixth Circuit then issued its Popovich decision , in which it interpreted Garrett to bar private ADA suits against States based on equal protection principles , but not those relying on due process , and therefore permitted a Title II damages action to proceed despite the States immunity claim . Thereafter , a Sixth Circuit panel affirmed the dismissal denial in this case , explaining that respondents claims were not barred because they were based on due process principles . In response to a rehearing petition arguing that Popovich did not control because respondents complaint did not allege due process violations , the panel filed an amended opinion , explaining that due process protects the right of access to the courts , and that the evidence before Congress when it enacted Title II established , inter alia , that physical barriers in courthouses and courtrooms have had the effect of denying disabled people the opportunity for such access .	The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state , or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state .	50
( b ) Title II is a valid exercise of Congress § 5 enforcement power . Pp . 1123 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
( 1 ) The Boerne inquirys first step requires identification of the constitutional rights Congress sought to enforce when it enacted Title II . Garrett , 531 U. S. , at 365 . Like Title I , Title II seeks to enforce the Fourteenth Amendments prohibition on irrational disability discrimination , Garrett , 531 U. S. , at 366 . But it also seeks to enforce a variety of other basic constitutional guarantees , including some , like the right of access to the courts here at issue , infringements of which are subject to heightened judicial scrutiny . See , e.g. , Dunn v. Blumstein , 405 U. S. 330 . Whether Title II validly enforces such constitutional rights is a question that must be judged with reference to the historical experience which it reflects. E.g. , South Carolina v. Katzenbach , 383 U. S. 301 . Congress enacted Title II against a backdrop of pervasive unequal treatment of persons with disabilities in the administration of state services and programs , including systematic deprivations of fundamental rights . The historical experience that Title II reflects is also documented in the decisions of this and other courts , which have identified unconstitutional treatment of disabled persons by state agencies in a variety of public programs and services . With respect to the particular services at issue , Congress learned that many individuals , in many States , were being excluded from courthouses and court proceedings by reason of their disabilities . A Civil Rights Commission report before Congress showed that some 76 % of public services and programs housed in state - owned buildings were inaccessible to and unusable by such persons . Congress also heard testimony from those persons describing the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses . And its appointed task force heard numerous examples of their exclusion from state judicial services and programs , including failure to make courtrooms accessible to witnesses with physical disabilities . The sheer volume of such evidence far exceeds the record in last Terms Nevada Dept . of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U. S. 721 , in which the Court approved the family - care leave provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 as valid § 5 legislation . Congress finding in the ADA that discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as … access to public services, § 12101(a)(3 ) , together with the extensive record of disability discrimination that underlies it , makes clear that inadequate provision of public services and access to public facilities was an appropriate subject for prophylactic legislation . Pp . 1118 .	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each state , excluding Indians not taxed . But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof . But Congress may by a vote of two - thirds of each House , remove such disability . The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law , including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion , shall not be questioned . But neither the United States nor any state shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States , or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave ; but all such debts , obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void . The Congress shall have power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article .	56
( 2 ) Title II is an appropriate response to this history and pattern of unequal treatment . Unquestionably , it is valid § 5 legislation as it applies to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of judicial services . Congress chosen remedy for the pattern of exclusion and discrimination at issue , Title IIs requirement of program accessibility , is congruent and proportional to its object of enforcing the right of access to the courts . The long history of unequal treatment of disabled persons in the administration of judicial services has persisted despite several state and federal legislative efforts to remedy the problem . Faced with considerable evidence of the shortcomings of these previous efforts , Congress was justified in concluding that the difficult and intractable problem of disability discrimination warranted added prophylactic measures . Hibbs , 538 U. S. , at 737 . The remedy Congress chose is nevertheless a limited one . Recognizing that failure to accommodate persons with disabilities will often have the same practical effect as outright exclusion , Congress required the States to take reasonable measures to remove architectural and other barriers to accessibility . § 12132 . But Title II does not require States to employ any and all means to make judicial services accessible or to compromise essential eligibility criteria for public programs . It requires only reasonable modifications that would not fundamentally alter the nature of the service provided , and only when the individual seeking modification is otherwise eligible for the service . Ibid . Title IIs implementing regulations make clear that the reasonable modification requirement can be satisfied in various ways , including less costly measures than structural changes . This duty to accommodate is perfectly consistent with the well - established due process principle that , within the limits of practicability , a State must afford to all individuals a meaningful opportunity to be heard in its courts . Boddie , 401 U. S. , at 379 . A number of affirmative obligations flow from this principle . Cases such as Boddie , Griffin v. Illinois , 351 U. S. 12 , and Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U. S. 335 , make clear that ordinary considerations of cost and convenience alone can not justify a States failure to provide individuals with a meaningful right of access to the courts . Judged against this backdrop , Title IIs affirmative obligation to accommodate is a reasonable prophylactic measure , reasonably targeted to a legitimate end . Pp . 1823 .	@@empty@@	unmatched

In Board of Trustees of Univ . of Ala. v. Garrett , 531 U. S. 356 ( 2001 ) , we held that Congress did not validly abrogate States Eleventh Amendment immunity when it enacted Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ( ADA ) , 42 U. S. C. § § 1211112117 . Today , the Court concludes that Title II of that Act , § § 1213112165 , does validly abrogate that immunity , at least insofar as it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts. Ante , at 19 . Because todays decision is irreconcilable with Garrett and the well - established principles it embodies , I dissent .	The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state , or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state .	50
The Eleventh Amendment bars private lawsuits in federal court against an unconsenting State . E.g. , Nevada Dept . of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U.

Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment grants Congress the authority to enforce , by appropriate legislation, the familiar substantive guarantees contained in § 1 of that Amendment . U. S. Const . , Amdt . 14 , § 1 ( No State shall … deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws ) . Congress power to enact appropriate enforcement legislation is not limited to mere legislative repetition of this Courts Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence . Garrett , supra , at 365 . Congress may remedy and deter state violations of constitutional rights by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct , including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendments text. Hibbs , 538 U. S. , at 727 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . Such prophylactic legislation , however , must be an appropriate remedy for identified constitutional violations , not an attempt to substantively redefine the States legal obligations.  Id. , at 727728 ( quoting Kimel , supra , at 88 ) ; City of Boerne v. Flores , 521 U. S. 507 , 525 ( 1997 ) ( enforcement power is corrective or preventive , not definitional ) . To ensure that Congress does not usurp this Courts responsibility to define the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment , valid § 5 legislation must exhibit  congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.  Hibbs , supra , at 728 ( quoting City of Boerne , supra , at 520 ) . While the Court today pays lipservice to the congruence and proportionality test , see ante , at 8 , it applies it in a manner inconsistent with our recent precedents .	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside .

In Garrett , we conducted the three - step inquiry first enunciated in City of Boerne to determine whether Title I of the ADA satisfied the congruence - and - proportionality test . A faithful application of that test to Title II reveals that it too  substantively redefine[s],  rather than permissibly enforces , the rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment . Hibbs , supra , at 728 .	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside .

The Congress shall have power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article .	56
The first step is to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue. Garrett , supra , at 365 . This task was easy in Garrett , Hibbs , Kimel , and City of Boerne because the statutes in those cases sought to enforce only one constitutional right . In Garrett , for example , the statute addressed the equal protection right of disabled persons to be free from unconstitutional employment discrimination . Garrett , supra , at 365 . See also Hibbs , supra , at 728 ( The [ Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ( FMLA ) ] aims to protect the right to be free from gender - based discrimination in the workplace ) ; Kimel , supra , at 83 ( right to be free from unconstitutional age discrimination in employment ) ; City of Boerne , supra , at 529 ( right of free exercise of religion ) . The scope of that right , we explained , is quite limited ; indeed , the Equal Protection Clause permits a State to classify on the basis of disability so long as it has a rational basis for doing so . Garrett , supra , at 366368 ( discussing Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center , Inc. , 473 U. S. 432 ( 1985 ) ) ; see also ante , at 11 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In this case , the task of identifying the scope of the relevant constitutional protection is more difficult because Title II purports to enforce a panoply of constitutional rights of disabled persons : not only the equal protection right against irrational discrimination , but also certain rights protected by the Due Process Clause . Ante , at 1112 . However , because the Court ultimately upholds Title II as it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts, ante , at 19 , the proper inquiry focuses on the scope of those due process rights . The Court cites four access - to - the - courts rights that Title II purportedly enforces : ( 1 ) the right of the criminal defendant to be present at all critical stages of the trial , Faretta v. California , 422 U. S. 806 , 819 ( 1975 ) ; ( 2 ) the right of litigants to have a meaningful opportunity to be heard in judicial proceedings , Boddie v. Connecticut , 401 U. S. 371 , 379 ( 1971 ) ; ( 3 ) the right of the criminal defendant to trial by a jury composed of a fair cross section of the commun- ity , Taylor v. Louisiana , 419 U. S. 522 , 530 ( 1975 ) ; and ( 4 ) the public right of access to criminal proceedings , Press - Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal . , County of Riverside , 478 U. S. 1 , 815 ( 1986 ) . Ante , at 1112 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Having traced the metes and bounds of the constitutional rights at issue , the next step in the congruence - and - proportionality inquiry requires us to examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of violations of these constitutional rights by the States with respect to the disabled . Garrett , 531 U. S. , at 368 . This step is crucial to determining whether Title II is a legitimate attempt to remedy or prevent actual constitutional violations by the States or an illegitimate attempt to rewrite the constitutional provisions it purports to enforce . Indeed , Congress § 5 power is appropriately exercised only in response to state transgressions. Ibid . ( emphasis added ) . But the majority identifies nothing in the legislative record that shows Congress was responding to widespread violations of the due process rights of disabled persons .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Rather than limiting its discussion of constitutional violations to the due process rights on which it ultimately relies , the majority sets out on a wide - ranging account of societal discrimination against the disabled . Ante , at 1215 . This digression recounts historical discrimination against the disabled through institutionalization laws , restrictions on marriage , voting , and public education , conditions in mental hospitals , and various other forms of unequal treatment in the administration of public programs and services . Some of this evidence would be relevant if the Court were considering the constitutionality of the statute as a whole ; but the Court rejects that approach in favor of a narrower as - applied inquiry . 1 We discounted much the same type of outdated , generalized evidence in Garrett as unsupportive of Title Is ban on employment discrimination . 531 U. S. , at 368372 ; see also City of Boerne , 521 U. S. , at 530 ( noting that the legislative record lacks … modern instances of … religious bigotry ) . The evidence here is likewise irrelevant to Title IIs purported enforcement of Due Process access - to - the - courts rights .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Even if it were proper to consider this broader category of evidence , much of it does not concern unconstitutional action by the States . The bulk of the Courts evidence concerns discrimination by nonstate governments , rather than the States themselves . 2 We have repeatedly held that such evidence is irrelevant to the inquiry whether Congress has validly abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity , a privilege enjoyed only by the sovereign States . Garrett , supra , at 368369 ; Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed . Expense Bd . v. College Savings Bank , 527 U. S. 627 , 640 ( 1999 ) ; Kimel , 528 U. S. , at 89 . Moreover , the majority today cites the same congressional task force evidence we rejected in Garrett . Ante , at 15 ( citing Garrett , supra , at 379 ( Breyer , J. , dissenting ) , and 531 U. S. , at 391424 ( App . C to opinion of Breyer , J. , dissenting ) ( chronicling instances of unequal treatment in the administration of public programs ) ) . As in Garrett , this unexamined , anecdotal evidence does not suffice . 531 U. S. , at 370 . Most of the brief anecdotes do not involve States at all , and those that do are not sufficiently detailed to determine whether the instances of unequal treatment were irrational , and thus unconstitutional under our decision in Cleburne . Garrett , supra , at 370371 . Therefore , even outside the access to the courts context , the Court identifies few , if any , constitutional violations perpetrated by the States against disabled persons . 3	The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state , or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state .	50
With respect to the due process access to the courts rights on which the Court ultimately relies , Congress failure to identify a pattern of actual constitutional violations by the States is even more striking . Indeed , there is nothing in the legislative record or statutory findings to indicate that disabled persons were systematically denied the right to be present at criminal trials , denied the meaningful opportunity to be heard in civil cases , unconstitutionally excluded from jury service , or denied the right to attend criminal trials . 4	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Courts attempt to disguise the lack of congressional documentation with a few citations to judicial decisions can not retroactively provide support for Title II , and in any event , fails on its own terms . See , e.g . , Garrett , 531 U. S. , at 368 ( [W]e examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of constitutional violations ) ; ibid . ( [t]he legislative record … fails to show that Congress did in fact identify a pattern of constitutional violations ) ( emphases added ) . Indeed , because this type of constitutional violation occurs in connection with litigation , it is particularly telling that the majority is able to identify only two reported cases finding that a disabled persons federal constitutional rights were violated . 5 See ante , at 14 , n. 14 ( citing Ferrell v. Estelle , 568 F. 2d 1128 , 11321133 ( CA5 ) , opinion withdrawn as moot , 573 F. 2d 867 ( 1978 ) ; People v. Rivera , 125 Misc . 2d 516 , 528 , 480 N. Y. S. 2d 426 , 434 ( Sup . Ct . 1984 ) ) . 6	@@empty@@	unmatched
Lacking any real evidence that Congress was responding to actual due process violations , the majority relies primarily on three items to justify its decision : ( 1 ) a 1983 U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report showing that 76 % of public services and programs housed in state - owned buildings were inaccessible to persons with disabilities , ante , at 1516 ; ( 2 ) testimony before a House subcommittee regarding the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses , ante , at 16 ; and ( 3 ) evidence submitted to Congress designated ADA task force that purportedly contains numerous examples of the exclusion of persons with disabilities from state judicial services and programs. Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On closer examination , however , the Civil Rights Commissions finding consists of a single conclusory sentence in its report , and it is far from clear that its finding even includes courthouses . The House subcommittee report , for its part , contains the testimony of two witnesses , neither of whom reported being denied the right to be present at constitutionally protected court proceedings . 7 Indeed , the witnesses testimony , like the U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report , concerns only physical barriers to access , and does not address whether States either provided means to overcome those barriers or alternative locations for proceedings involving disabled persons . Cf . , n. 4 , supra ( describing alternative means of access offered to respondent Lane ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Based on the majoritys description , ante , at 16 , the report of the ADA Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities sounds promising . But the report itself says nothing about any disabled person being denied access to court . The Court thus apparently relies solely on a general citation to the Governments Lodging in Garrett , O. T. 2000 , No . 991240 which , amidst thousands of pages , contains only a few anecdotal handwritten reports of physically inaccessible courthouses , again with no mention of whether States provided alternate means of access . This evidence , moreover , was submitted not to Congress , but only to the task force , which itself made no findings regarding disabled persons access to judicial proceedings . Cf . Garrett , 531 U. S. , at 370371 ( rejecting anecdotal task force evidence for similar reasons ) . As we noted in Garrett , had Congress truly understood this [ task force ] information as reflecting a pattern of unconstitutional behavior by the States , one would expect some mention of that conclusion in the Acts legislative findings. Id. , at 371 . Yet neither the legislative findings , nor even the Committee Reports , contain a single mention of the seemingly vital topic of access to the courts . 8 Cf . ibid . ; Florida Prepaid , 527 U. S. , at 641 ( observing that Senate Report on Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act ( Patent Remedy Act ) contains no evidence that unremedied patent infringement by States had become a problem of national import ) . To the contrary , the Senate Report on the ADA observed that [a]ll states currently mandate accessibility in newly constructed state - owned public buildings. S. Rep. No . 101116 , p. 92 ( 1989 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Even if the anecdotal evidence and conclusory statements relied on by the majority could be properly considered , the mere existence of an architecturally inaccessible courthouse i.e. , one a disabled person can not utilize without assistancedoes not state a constitutional violation . A violation of due process occurs only when a person is actually denied the constitutional right to access a given judicial proceeding . We have never held that a person has a constitutional right to make his way into a courtroom without any external assistance . Indeed , the fact that the State may need to assist an individual to attend a hearing has no bearing on whether the individual successfully exercises his due process right to be present at the proceeding . Nor does an inaccessible courthouse violate the Equal Protection Clause , unless it is irrational for the State not to alter the courthouse to make it accessible. But financial considerations almost always furnish a rational basis for a State to decline to make those alterations . See Garrett , 531 U. S. , at 372 ( noting that it would be constitutional for an employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who can use existing facilities rather than making the facilities accessible to disabled employees ) . Thus , evidence regarding inaccessible courthouses , because it is not evidence of constitutional violations , provides no basis to abrogate States sovereign immunity .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The near - total lack of actual constitutional violations in the congressional record is reminiscent of Garrett , wherein we found that the same type of minimal anecdotal evidence f[e]ll far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional [ state action ] on which § 5 legislation must be based. Id. , at 370 . See also Kimel , 528 U. S. , at 91 ( Congress failure to uncover any significant pattern of unconstitutional discrimination here confirms that Congress had no reason to believe that broad prophylactic legislation was necessary ) ; Florida Prepaid , supra , at 645 ( The legislative record thus suggests that the Patent Remedy Act did not respond to a history of widespread and persisting deprivation of constitutional rights of the sort Congress has faced in enacting proper prophylactic § 5 legislation ( quoting City of Boerne , 521 U. S. , at 526 ) ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts . This conclusion gains even more support when Title IIs nonexistent record of constitutional violations is compared with legislation that we have sustained as valid § 5 enforcement legislation . See , e.g. , Hibbs , 538 U. S. , at 729732 ( tracing the extensive legislative record documenting States gender discrimination in employment leave policies ) ; South Carolina v. Katzenbach , 383 U. S. 301 , 312313 ( 1966 ) ( same with respect to racial discrimination in voting rights ) . Accordingly , Title II can only be understood as a congressional attempt to rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment law laid down by this Court, rather than a legitimate effort to remedy or prevent state violations of that Amendment . Garrett , supra , at 374 . 9	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each state , excluding Indians not taxed . But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof . But Congress may by a vote of two - thirds of each House , remove such disability . The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law , including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion , shall not be questioned . But neither the United States nor any state shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States , or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave ; but all such debts , obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void . The Congress shall have power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article .	56
The third step of our congruence - and - proportionality inquiry removes any doubt as to whether Title II is valid § 5 legislation . At this stage , we ask whether the rights and remedies created by Title II are congruent and proportional to the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of constitutional violations adduced by Congress . Hibbs , supra , at 737739 ; Garrett , supra , at 372373 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Title II provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall , by reason of such disability , be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services , programs , or activities of a public entity , or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity. 42 U. S. C. § 12132 . A disabled person is considered qualified if he meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of the entitys services or participation in the entitys programs ,  with or without reasonable modifications to rules , policies , or practices , the removal of architectural , communication , or transportation barriers , or the provision of auxiliary aids and services .  § 12131(2 ) ( emphasis added ) . The ADAs findings make clear that Congress believed it was attacking discrimination in all areas of public services , as well as the discriminatory effect of architectural , transportation , and communication barriers. § § 12101(a)(3 ) , ( a)(5 ) . In sum , Title II requires , on pain of money damages , special accommodations for disabled persons in virtually every interaction they have with the State .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Despite subjecting States to this expansive liability, the broad terms of Title II d[o ] nothing to limit the coverage of the Act to cases involving arguable constitutional violations. Florida Prepaid , 527 U. S. , at 646 . By requiring special accommodation and the elimination of programs that have a disparate impact on the disabled , Title II prohibits far more state conduct than does the equal protection ban on irrational discrimination . We invalidated Title Is similar requirements in Garrett , observing that [i]f special accommodations for the disabled are to be required , they have to come from positive law and not through the Equal Protection Clause. 531 U. S. , at 368 ; i d . , at 372373 ( contrasting Title Is reasonable accommodation and disparate impact provisions with the Fourteenth Amendments requirements ) . Title II fails for the same reason . Like Title I , Title II may be laudable public policy , but it can not be seriously disputed that it is also an attempt to legislatively redefine the States legal obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment . Kimel , 528 U. S. , at 88 .	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each state , excluding Indians not taxed . But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof . But Congress may by a vote of two - thirds of each House , remove such disability . The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law , including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion , shall not be questioned .

The Congress shall have power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article .	56
The majority , however , claims that Title II also vindicates fundamental rights protected by the Due Process Clausein addition to access to the courtsthat are subject to heightened Fourteenth Amendment scrutiny . Ante , at 11 ( citing Dunn v. Blumstein , 405 U. S. 330 , 336337 ( 1972 ) ( voting ) ; Shapiro v. Thompson , 394 U. S. 618 , 634 ( 1969 ) ( right to move to a new jurisdiction ) ; Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel . Williamson , 316 U. S. 535 , 541 ( 1942 ) ( marriage and procreation ) ) . But Title II is not tailored to provide prophylactic protection of these rights ; instead , it applies to any service , program , or activity provided by any entity . Its provisions affect transportation , health , education , and recreation programs , among many others , all of which are accorded only rational - basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause . A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state - owned amusement park or sports stadium , for example , bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights . Thus , as with Title I in Garrett , the Patent Remedy Act in Florida Prepaid , the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 in Kimel , and the RFRA in City of Boerne , all of which we invalidated as attempts to substantively redefine the Fourteenth Amendment , it is unlikely that many of the [ state actions ] affected by [ Title II ] ha[ve ] any likelihood of being unconstitutional. City of Boerne , supra , at 532 . Viewed as a whole , then , there is little doubt that Title II of the ADA does not validly abrogate state sovereign immunity . 10	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws .

No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof . But Congress may by a vote of two - thirds of each House , remove such disability . The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law , including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion , shall not be questioned .

The Congress shall have power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article .	56
The majority concludes that Title IIs massive overbreadth can be cured by considering the statute only as it applies to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of judicial services. Ante , at 20 ( citing United States v. Raines , 362 U. S. 17 , 26 ( 1960 ) ) . I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the § 5 context . While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case , the proper inquiry under City of Boerne and its progeny is somewhat different . In applying the congruence - and - proportionality test , we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment . This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy .	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each state , excluding Indians not taxed . But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof . But Congress may by a vote of two - thirds of each House , remove such disability . The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law , including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion , shall not be questioned . But neither the United States nor any state shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States , or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave ; but all such debts , obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void . The Congress shall have power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article .	56
In conducting its as - applied analysis , however , the majority posits a hypothetical statute , never enacted by Congress , that applies only to courthouses . The effect is to rig the congruence - and - proportionality test by artificially constricting the scope of the statute to closely mirror a recognized constitutional right . But Title II is not susceptible of being carved up in this manner ; it applies indiscriminately to all services, programs, or activities of any public entity. Thus , the majoritys approach is not really an assessment of whether Title II is appropriate legislation  at all , U. S. Const . , Amdt . 14 , § 5 ( emphasis added ) , but a test of whether the Court can conceive of a hypothetical statute narrowly tailored enough to constitute valid prophylactic legislation .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Our § 5 precedents do not support this as - applied approach . In each case , we measured the full breadth of the statute or relevant provision that Congress enacted against the scope of the constitutional right it purported to enforce . If we had arbitrarily constricted the scope of the statutes to match the scope of a core constitutional right , those cases might have come out differently . In Garrett , for example , Title I might have been upheld as applied to irrational employment discrimination ; or in Florida Prepaid , the Patent Remedy Act might have been upheld as applied to intentional , uncompensated patent infringements . It is thus not surprising that the only authority cited by the majority is Raines , supra , a case decided long before we enunciated the congruence - and - proportionality test . 11	@@empty@@	unmatched
I fear that the Courts adoption of an as - applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft § 5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations . Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute , such as Title II , may be enforced against the States . All the while , States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their Eleventh Amendment rights . The majoritys as - applied approach simply can not be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary .	The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state , or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state .	50
Even in the limited courthouse - access context , Title II does not properly abrogate state sovereign immunity . As demonstrated in depth above , Congress utterly failed to identify any evidence that disabled persons were denied constitutionally protected access to judicial proceedings . Without this predicate showing , Title II , even if we were to hypothesize that it applies only to courthouses , can not be viewed as a congruent and proportional response to state constitutional violations . Garrett , 531 U. S. , at 368 ( Congress § 5 authority is appropriately exercised only in response to state transgressions ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Moreover , even in the courthouse - access context , Title II requires substantially more than the Due Process Clause . Title II subjects States to private lawsuits if , inter alia , they fail to make reasonable modifications to fa- cilities , such as removing architectural … barriers. 42 U. S. , C. § § 12131(2 ) , 12132 . Yet the statute is not limited to occasions when the failure to modify results , or will likely result , in an actual due process violation i.e. , the inability of a disabled person to participate in a judicial proceeding . Indeed , liability is triggered if an inaccessible building results in a disabled person being subjected to discriminationa term that presumably encompasses any sort of inconvenience in accessing the facility , for whatever purpose . § 12132 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The majoritys reliance on Boddie v. Connecticut , 401 U. S. 371 ( 1971 ) , and other cases in which we held that due process requires the State to waive filing fees for indigent litigants , is unavailing . While these cases support the principle that the State must remove financial requirements that in fact prevent an individual from exercising his constitutional rights , they certainly do not support a statute that subjects a State to liability for failing to make a vast array of special accommodations , without regard for whether the failure to accommodate results in a constitutional wrong .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In this respect , Title II is analogous to the Patent Remedy Act at issue in Florida Prepaid . That statute subjected States to monetary liability for any act of patent infringement . 527 U. S. , at 646647 . Thus , Congress did nothing to limit the Acts coverage to cases involving arguable [ Due Process ] violations, such as when the infringement was nonnegligent or uncompensated . Ibid . Similarly here , Congress has authorized private damages suits against a State for merely maintaining a courthouse that is not readily accessible to the disabled , without regard to whether a disabled persons due process rights are ever violated . Accordingly , even as applied to the access to the courts context , Title IIs indiscriminate scope offends [ the congruence - and - proportionality ] principle, particularly in light of the lack of record evidence showing that inaccessible courthouses cause actual Due Process violations .
