Marshall's statement cannot be read to mean in any sense that a President is above the law, but relates to the singularly unique role under Art. II of a President's communications and activities, related to the performance of duties under that Article.  Moreover, a President's communications and activities encompass a vastly wider range of sensitive material than would be true of any \"ordinary individual.\"  It is therefore necessary\n\n [n21]\n\n in the public interest to afford Presidential confidentiality the greatest protection consistent with the fair administration of justice.  The need for confidentiality even as to idle conversations with associates in which casual reference might be made concerning political leaders within the country or foreign statesmen is too obvious to call for further treatment.  We have no doubt that the District Judge will at all times accord to Presidential records that high degree of deference suggested in United States v. Burr, supra, and will discharge his responsibility to see to \n[p716]\n it that, until released to the Special Prosecutor, no in camera material is revealed to anyone.  This burden applies with even greater force to excised material; once the decision is made to excise, the material is restored to its privileged status, and should be returned under seal to its lawful custodian.", "meta": {"id": 71, "doc_type": null, "date": null, "source_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/418/683"}}
