Dole, supra, at 211.  Medicaid spending accounts for over 20 percent of the average State\u2019s total budget, with federal funds covering 50 to 83 percent of those costs.  See Nat.

In addition, the States have developed intricate statutory and administrative regimes over the course of many decades to implement their objectives under existing Medicaid.  It is easy to see how the Dole Court could conclude that the threatened loss of less than half of one percent of South Dakota\u2019s budget left that State with a \u201cprerogative\u201d to reject Congress\u2019s desired policy, \u201cnot merely in theory but in fact.\u201d  483 U.\u00a0S., at 211\u2013212.

For ex-ample, the Federal Government bears the burden of paying billions for the new entitlements mandated by the Medicaid Expansion and federal subsidies for insurance purchases on the exchanges; but it benefits from reductions in the reimbursements it pays to hospitals.  Hospitals lose those reimbursements; but they benefit from the decrease in uncompensated care, for under the insurance regulations it is easier for individuals with pre-existing conditions to purchase coverage that increases payments to hospitals.  Insurance companies bear new costs imposed by a collection of insurance regulations and taxes, including \u201cguaranteed issue\u201d and \u201ccommunity rating\u201d requirements to give coverage regardless of the insured\u2019s pre-existing conditions; but the insurers benefit from the new, healthy purchasers who are forced by the Individual Mandateto buy the insurers\u2019 product and from the new low-income Medicaid recipients who will enroll in insurance companies\u2019 Medicaid-funded managed care programs.
