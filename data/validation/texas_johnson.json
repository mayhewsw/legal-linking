Thus, in no way can it be said that Texas is punishing him because his hearers -- or any other group of people -- were profoundly opposed to the message that he sought to convey.  Such opposition is no proper basis for restricting speech or expression under the First Amendment.  It was Johnson's use of this particular symbol, and not the idea that he sought to convey by it or by his many other expressions, for which he was punished.", "meta": {"id": 119, "doc_type": null, "date": null, "source_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/491/397"}}

The concept of \"desecration\" does not turn on the substance of the message the actor intends to convey, but rather on whether those who view the act will take serious offense.  Accordingly, one intending to convey a message of respect for the flag by burning it in a public square might nonetheless be guilty of desecration if he knows that others -- perhaps simply because they misperceive the intended message -- will be seriously offended.  Indeed, even if the actor knows that all possible witnesses will understand that he intends to send a message of respect, he might still be guilty of desecration if he also knows that this understanding does not lessen the offense taken by some of those witnesses.
