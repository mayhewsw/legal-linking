Appellants , the Executive Director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut , and its medical director , a licensed physician , were convicted as accessories for giving married persons information and medical advice on how to prevent conception and , following examination , prescribing a contraceptive device or material for the wife 's use . A Connecticut statute makes it a crime for any person to use any drug or article to prevent conception .

MR . JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court .	unmatched
Appellant Griswold is Executive Director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut . Appellant Buxton is a licensed physician and a professor at the Yale Medical School who served as Medical Director for the League at its Center in New Haven -- a center open and operating from November 1 to November 10 , 1961 , when appellants were arrested .	unmatched
They gave information , instruction , and medical advice to married persons as to the means of preventing conception . They examined the wife and prescribed the best contraceptive device or material for her use . Fees were usually charged , although some couples were serviced free .	unmatched
The statutes whose constitutionality is involved in this appeal are § § 53 - 32 and 54 - 196 of the General Statutes of Connecticut ( 1958 rev . ) . The former provides :	unmatched
Section 54 - 196 provides :	unmatched
The appellants were found guilty as accessories and fined $ 100 each , against the claim that the accessory statute , as so applied , violated the Fourteenth Amendment . The Appellate Division of the Circuit Court affirmed . The Supreme Court of Errors affirmed that judgment . 151 Conn. 544 , 200 A.2d 479 . We noted probable jurisdiction . 379 U.S. 926 . [ p481 ]	amendmentxiv
We think that appellants have standing to raise the constitutional rights of the married people with whom they had a professional relationship . Tileston v. Ullman , 318 U.S. 44 , is different , for there the plaintiff seeking to represent others asked for a declaratory Judgment . In that situation , we thought that the requirements of standing should be strict , lest the standards of " case or controversy " in Article III of the Constitution become blurred . Here , those doubts are removed by reason of a criminal conviction for serving married couples in violation of an aiding - and - abetting statute . Certainly the accessory should have standing to assert that the offense which he is charged with assisting is not , or can not constitutionally be , a crime .	articleiii#section2
This case is more akin to Truax v. Raich , 239 U.S. 33 , where an employee was permitted to assert the rights of his employer ; to Pierce v. Society of Sisters , 268 U.S. 510 , where the owners of private schools were entitled to assert the rights of potential pupils and their parents , and to Barrows v. Jackson , 346 U.S. 249 , where a white defendant , party to a racially restrictive covenant , who was being sued for damages by the covenantors because she had conveyed her property to Negroes , was allowed to raise the issue that enforcement of the covenant violated the rights of prospective Negro purchasers to equal protection , although no Negro was a party to the suit . And see Meyer v. Nebraska , 262 U.S. 390 ; Adler v. Board of Education , 342 U.S. 485 ; NAACP v. Alabama , 357 U.S. 449 ; NAACP v. Button , 371 U.S. 415 . The rights of husband and wife , pressed here , are likely to be diluted or adversely affected unless those rights are considered in a suit involving those who have this kind of confidential relation to them .	articleiii#section2
Coming to the merits , we are met with a wide range of questions that implicate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . Overtones of some arguments [ p482 ] suggest that Lochner v. New York , 198 U.S. 45 , should be our guide . But we decline that invitation , as we did in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish , 300 U.S. 379 ; Olsen v. Nebraska , 313 U.S. 236 ; Lincoln Union v. Northwestern Co. , 335 U.S. 525 ; Williamson v. Lee Optical Co. , 348 U.S. 483 ; Giboney v. Empire Storage Co. , 336 U.S. 490 . We do not sit as a super - legislature to determine the wisdom , need , and propriety of laws that touch economic problems , business affairs , or social conditions . This law , however , operates directly on an intimate relation of husband and wife and their physician 's role in one aspect of that relation .	amendmentxiv
The association of people is not mentioned in the Constitution nor in the Bill of Rights . The right to educate a child in a school of the parents ' choice -- whether public or private or parochial -- is also not mentioned . Nor is the right to study any particular subject or any foreign language . Yet the First Amendment has been construed to include certain of those rights .	first_amendment
By Pierce v. Society of Sisters , supra , the right to educate one 's children as one chooses is made applicable to the States by the force of the First and Fourteenth Amendments . By Meyer v. Nebraska , supra , the same dignity is given the right to study the German language in a private school . In other words , the State may not , consistently with the spirit of the First Amendment , contract the spectrum of available knowledge . The right of freedom of speech and press includes not only the right to utter or to print , but the right to distribute , the right to receive , the right to read ( Martin v. Struthers , 319 U.S. 141 , 143 ) and freedom of inquiry , freedom of thought , and freedom to teach ( see Wiemann v. Updegraff , 344 U.S. 183 , 195 ) -- indeed , the freedom of the entire university community . Sweezy v. New Hampshire , 354 U.S. 234 , 249 - 250 , 261 - 263 ; Barenblatt v. United States , 360 U.S. 109 , 112 ; Baggett v. Bullitt , 377 U.S. 360 , 369 . Without [ p483 ] those peripheral rights , the specific rights would be less secure . And so we reaffirm the principle of the Pierce and the Meyer cases .	amendmentxiv,first_amendment
In NAACP v. Alabama , 357 U.S. 449 , 462 we protected the " freedom to associate and privacy in one 's associations , " noting that freedom of association was a peripheral First Amendment right . Disclosure of membership lists of a constitutionally valid association , we held , was invalid	first_amendment
Ibid . In other words , the First Amendment has a penumbra where privacy is protected from governmental intrusion . In like context , we have protected forms of " association " that are not political in the customary sense , but pertain to the social , legal , and economic benefit of the members . NAACP v. Button , 371 U.S. 415 , 430 - 431 . In Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners , 353 U.S. 232 , we held it not permissible to bar a lawyer from practice because he had once been a member of the Communist Party . The man 's " association with that Party " was not shown to be " anything more than a political faith in a political party " ( i d . at 244 ) , and was not action of a kind proving bad moral character . Id. at 245 - 246 .	first_amendment
Those cases involved more than the " right of assembly " -- a right that extends to all , irrespective of their race or ideology . De Jonge v. Oregon , 299 U.S. 353 . The right of " association , " like the right of belief ( Board of Education v. Barnette , 319 U.S. 624 ) , is more than the right to attend a meeting ; it includes the right to express one 's attitudes or philosophies by membership in a group or by affiliation with it or by other lawful means . Association in that context is a form of expression of opinion , and , while it is not expressly included in the First Amendment , its existence is necessary in making the express guarantees fully meaningful . [ p484 ]	first_amendment
The foregoing cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras , formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance . See Poe v. Ullman , 367 U.S. 497 , 516 - 522 ( dissenting opinion ) . Various guarantees create zones of privacy . The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one , as we have seen . The Third Amendment , in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers " in any house " in time of peace without the consent of the owner , is another facet of that privacy . The Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the " right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures . " The Fifth Amendment , in its Self - Incrimination Clause , enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which government may not force him to surrender to his detriment . The Ninth Amendment provides : " The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . "	third_amendment,fifth_amendment,fourth_amendment,first_amendment
The Fourth and Fifth Amendments were described in Boyd v. United States , 116 U.S. 616 , 630 , as protection against all governmental invasions " of the sanctity of a man 's home and the privacies of life . " [ * ] We recently referred [ p485 ] in Mapp v. Ohio , 367 U.S. 643 , 656 , to the Fourth Amendment as creating a " right to privacy , no less important than any other right carefully an particularly reserved to the people . " See Beaney , The Constitutional Right to Privacy , 1962 Sup . Ct . Rev . 212 ; Griswold , The Right to be Let Alone , 55 Nw . U.L.Rev . 216 ( 1960 ) .	fifth_amendment,fourth_amendment
We have had many controversies over these penumbral rights of " privacy and repose . " See , e.g. , Breard v. Alexandria , 341 U.S. 622 , 626 , 644 ; Public Utilities Comm'n v. Pollak , 343 U.S. 451 ; Monroe v. Pape , 365 U.S. 167 ; Lanza v. New York , 370 U.S. 139 ; Frank v. Maryland , 359 U.S. 360 ; Skinner v. Oklahoma , 316 U.S. 535 , 541 . These cases bear witness that the right of privacy which presses for recognition here is a legitimate one .	fifth_amendment,fourth_amendment
The present case , then , concerns a relationship lying within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees . And it concerns a law which , in forbidding the use of contraceptives , rather than regulating their manufacture or sale , seeks to achieve its goals by means having a maximum destructive impact upon that relationship . Such a law can not stand in light of the familiar principle , so often applied by this Court , that a	unmatched

We deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights -- older than our political parties , older than our school system . Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse , hopefully enduring , and intimate to the degree of being sacred . It is an association that promotes a way of life , not causes ; a harmony in living , not political faiths ; a bilateral loyalty , not commercial or social projects . Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions .	unmatched

MR . JUSTICE GOLDBERG , whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR . JUSTICE BRENNAN join , concurring .	unmatched
I agree with the Court that Connecticut 's birth control law unconstitutionally intrudes upon the right of marital privacy , and I join in its opinion and judgment . Although I have not accepted the view that " due process , " as used in the Fourteenth Amendment , incorporates all of the first eight Amendments ( see my concurring opinion in Pointer v. Texas , 380 U.S. 400 , 410 , and the dissenting opinion of MR . JUSTICE BRENNAN in Cohen v. Hurley , 366 U.S. 117 , 154 ) , I do agree that the concept of liberty protects those personal rights that are fundamental , and is not confined to the specific terms of the Bill of Rights . My conclusion that the concept of liberty is not so restricted , and that it embraces the right of marital privacy , though that right is not mentioned explicitly in the Constitution , [ n1 ] is supported both by numerous [ p487 ] decisions of this Court , referred to in the Court 's opinion , and by the language and history of the Ninth Amendment . In reaching the conclusion that the right of marital privacy is protected as being within the protected penumbra of specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights , the Court refers to the Ninth Amendment , ante at 484 . I add these words to emphasize the relevance of that Amendment to the Court 's holding .	amendmentxiv,ninth_amendment
The Court stated many years ago that the Due Process Clause protects those liberties that are " so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental . " Snyder v.

This Court , in a series of decisions , has held that the Fourteenth Amendment absorbs and applies to the States those specifics of the first eight amendments which express fundamental personal rights . [ n2 ] The language and history of the Ninth Amendment reveal that the Framers of the Constitution believed that there are additional fundamental rights , protected from governmental infringement , which exist alongside those fundamental rights specifically mentioned in the first eight constitutional amendments . The Ninth Amendment reads , " The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . " The Amendment is almost entirely the work of James Madison . It was introduced in Congress by him , and passed the House and Senate with little or no debate and virtually no change in language . It was proffered to quiet expressed fears that a bill of specifically enumerated rights [ n3 ] could not be sufficiently broad to cover all essential [ p489 ] rights , and that the specific mention of certain rights would be interpreted as a denial that others were protected .

While this Court has had little occasion to interpret the Ninth Amendment , [ n6 ] " [ i]t can not be presumed that any [ p491 ] clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect . " Marbury v. Madison , 1 Cranch 137 , 174 . In interpreting the Constitution , " real effect should be given to all the words it uses . " Myers v. United States , 272 U.S. 52 , 151 . The Ninth Amendment to the Constitution may be regarded by some as a recent discovery , and may be forgotten by others , but , since 1791 , it has been a basic part of the Constitution which we are sworn to uphold . To hold that a right so basic and fundamental and so deep - rooted in our society as the right of privacy in marriage may be infringed because that right is not guaranteed in so many words by the first eight amendments to the Constitution is to ignore the Ninth Amendment , and to give it no effect whatsoever . Moreover , a judicial construction that this fundamental right is not protected by the Constitution because it is not mentioned in explicit terms by one of the first eight amendments or elsewhere in the Constitution would violate the Ninth Amendment , which specifically states that [ p492 ] " [ t]he enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . " ( Emphasis added . )	ninth_amendment
A dissenting opinion suggests that my interpretation of the Ninth Amendment somehow " broaden[s ] the powers of this Court . " Post at 520 . With all due respect , I believe that it misses the import of what I am saying . I do not take the position of my Brother BLACK in his dissent in Adamson v. California , 332 U.S. 46 , 68 , that the entire Bill of Rights is incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment , and I do not mean to imply that the Ninth Amendment is applied against the States by the Fourteenth . Nor do I mean to state that the Ninth Amendment constitutes an independent source of rights protected from infringement by either the States or the Federal Government . Rather , the Ninth Amendment shows a belief of the Constitution 's authors that fundamental rights exist that are not expressly enumerated in the first eight amendments , and an intent that the list of rights included there not be deemed exhaustive . As any student of this Court 's opinions knows , this Court has held , often unanimously , that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect certain fundamental personal liberties from abridgment by the Federal Government or the States . See , e.g. , Bolling v. Sharpe , 347 U.S. 497 ; Aptheker v. Secretary of State , 378 U.S. 500 ; Kent v. Dulles , 357 U.S. 116 , Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310 U.S. 296 ; NAACP v. Alabama , 357 U.S. 449 ; Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U.S. 335 ; New York Times Co. v. Sullivan , 376 U.S. 254 . The Ninth Amendment simply shows the intent of the Constitution 's authors that other fundamental personal rights should not be denied such protection or disparaged in any other way simply because they are not specifically listed in the first eight constitutional amendments . I do not see how this broadens the authority [ p493 ] of the Court ; rather it serves to support what this Court has been doing in protecting fundamental rights .	amendmentxiv,fifth_amendment,ninth_amendment
Nor am I turning somersaults with history in arguing that the Ninth Amendment is relevant in a case dealing with a State 's infringement of a fundamental right . While the Ninth Amendment -- and indeed the entire Bill of Rights -- originally concerned restrictions upon federal power , the subsequently enacted Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the States as well from abridging fundamental personal liberties . And the Ninth Amendment , in indicating that not all such liberties are specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments , is surely relevant in showing the existence of other fundamental personal rights , now protected from state , as well as federal , infringement . In sum , the Ninth Amendment simply lends strong support to the view that the " liberty " protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments from infringement by the Federal Government or the States is not restricted to rights specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments .

In determining which rights are fundamental , judges are not left at large to decide cases in light of their personal and private notions .

United States , 277 U.S. 438 , 478 , comprehensively summarized the principles underlying the Constitution 's guarantees of privacy :	unmatched
The Connecticut statutes here involved deal with a particularly important and sensitive area of privacy -- that of the marital relation and the marital home . This Court recognized in Meyer v. Nebraska , supra , that the right " to marry , establish a home and bring up children " was an essential part of the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment . 262 U.S. at 399 . In Pierce v. Society of Sisters , 268 U.S. 510 , the Court held unconstitutional an Oregon Act which forbade parents from sending their children to private schools because such an act " unreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control . " 268 U.S. at 534 - 535 . As this Court said in Prince v. Massachusetts , 321 U.S. 158 , at 166 , the Meyer and Pierce decisions " have respected the private realm of family life which the state can not enter . "	unmatched
I agree with MR . JUSTICE HARLAN 's statement in his dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman , 367 U.S. 497 , 551 - 552 :	unmatched
The entire fabric of the Constitution and the purposes that clearly underlie its specific guarantees demonstrate that the rights to marital privacy and to marry and raise a family are of similar order and magnitude as the fundamental rights specifically protected .	unmatched
Although the Constitution does not speak in so many words of the right of privacy in marriage , I can not believe that it offers these fundamental rights no protection . The fact that no particular provision of the Constitution [ p496 ] explicitly forbids the State from disrupting the traditional relation of the family -- a relation as old and as fundamental as our entire civilization -- surely does not show that the Government was meant to have the power to do so . Rather , as the Ninth Amendment expressly recognizes , there are fundamental personal rights such as this one , which are protected from abridgment by the Government , though not specifically mentioned in the Constitution .	ninth_amendment
My Brother STEWART , while characterizing the Connecticut birth control law as " an uncommonly silly law , " post at 527 , would nevertheless let it stand on the ground that it is not for the courts to " ‘ substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies , who are elected to pass laws . ' " Post at 528 . Elsewhere , I have stated that ,	unmatched
The vice of the dissenters ' views is that it would permit such experimentation by the States in the area of the fundamental personal rights of its citizens . I can not agree that the Constitution grants such power either to the States or to the Federal Government .	unmatched
The logic of the dissents would sanction federal or state legislation that seems to me even more plainly unconstitutional than the statute before us . Surely the Government , absent a showing of a compelling subordinating state interest , could not decree that all husbands and wives must be sterilized after two children have been born [ p497 ] to them . Yet , by their reasoning , such an invasion of marital privacy would not be subject to constitutional challenge , because , while it might be " silly , " no provision of the Constitution specifically prevents the Government from curtailing the marital right to bear children and raise a family . While it may shock some of my Brethren that the Court today holds that the Constitution protects the right of marital privacy , in my view , it is far more shocking to believe that the personal liberty guaranteed by the Constitution does not include protection against such totalitarian limitation of family size , which is at complete variance with our constitutional concepts . Yet if , upon a showing of a slender basis of rationality , a law outlawing voluntary birth control by married persons is valid , then , by the same reasoning , a law requiring compulsory birth control also would seem to be valid . In my view , however , both types of law would unjustifiably intrude upon rights of marital privacy which are constitutionally protected .	unmatched
In a long series of cases , this Court has held that , where fundamental personal liberties are involved , they may not be abridged by the States simply on a showing that a regulatory statute has some rational relationship to the effectuation of a proper state purpose .	unmatched
Bates v. Little Rock , 361 U.S. 516 , 524 . The law must be shown " necessary , and not merely rationally related , to the accomplishment of a permissible state policy . " McLaughlin v. Florida , 379 U.S. 184 , 196 . See Schneider v. Irvington , 308 U.S. 147 , 161 .	unmatched
Although the Connecticut birth control law obviously encroaches upon a fundamental personal liberty , the State does not show that the law serves any " subordinating [ state ] interest which is compelling , " or that it is " necessary [ p498 ] . . . to the accomplishment of a permissible state policy . " The State , at most , argues that there is some rational relation between this statute and what is admittedly a legitimate subject of state concern -- the discouraging of extramarital relations . It says that preventing the use of birth control devices by married persons helps prevent the indulgence by some in such extramarital relations . The rationality of this justification is dubious , particularly in light of the admitted widespread availability to all persons in the State of Connecticut . unmarried as well as married , of birth control devices for the prevention of disease , as distinguished from the prevention of conception , see Tileston v. Ullman , 129 Conn. 84 , 26 A.2d 582 . But , in any event , it is clear that the state interest in safeguarding marital fidelity can be served by a more discriminately tailored statute which does not , like the present one , sweep unnecessarily broadly , reaching far beyond the evil sought to be dealt with and intruding upon the privacy of all married couples . See Aptheker v. Secretary of State , 378 U.S. 500 , 514 ; NAACP v. Alabama , 377 U.S. 288 , 307 - 308 ; McLaughlin v. Florida , supra , at 196 . Here , as elsewhere , " [ p]recision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms . " NAACP v. Button , 371 U.S. 415 , 438 . The State of Connecticut does have statutes , the constitutionality of which is beyond doubt , which prohibit adultery and fornication . See Conn . Gen . Stat . § § 53 - 218 , 53 - 219 et seq . These statutes demonstrate that means for achieving the same basic purpose of protecting marital fidelity are available to Connecticut without the need to " invade the area of protected freedoms . " NAACP v. Alabama , supra , at 307 . See McLaughlin v. Florida , supra , at 196 .	unmatched
Finally , it should be said of the Court 's holding today that it in no way interferes with a State 's proper regulation [ p499 ] of sexual promiscuity or misconduct . As my Brother HARLAN so well stated in his dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman , supra , at 553 .	unmatched
In sum , I believe that the right of privacy in the marital relation is fundamental and basic -- a personal right " retained by the people " within the meaning of the Ninth Amendment . Connecticut can not constitutionally abridge this fundamental right , which is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from infringement by the States . I agree with the Court that petitioners ' convictions must therefore be reversed .	ninth_amendment
Post at 530 . He would require a more explicit guarantee than the one which the Court derives from several constitutional amendments . This Court , however , has never held that the Bill of Rights or the Fourteenth Amendment protects only those rights that the Constitution specifically mentions by name . See , e.g. , Bolling v. Sharpe , 347 U.S. 497 ; Aptheker v. Secretary of State , 378 U.S. 500 ; Kent v. Dulles , 357 U.S. 116 ; Carrington v. Rash , 380 U.S. 89 , 96 ; Schware v.

To the contrary , this Court , for example , in Bolling v. Sharpe , supra , while recognizing that the Fifth Amendment does not contain the " explicit safeguard " of an equal protection clause , i d . at 499 , nevertheless derived an equal protection principle from that Amendment 's Due Process Clause .

I fully agree with the judgment of reversal , but find myself unable to join the Court 's opinion . The reason is that it seems to me to evince an approach to this case very much like that taken by my Brothers BLACK and STEWART in dissent , namely : the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not touch this Connecticut statute unless the enactment is found to violate some right assured by the letter or penumbra of the Bill of Rights . [ p500 ]	amendmentxiv
In other words , what I find implicit in the Court 's opinion is that the " incorporation " doctrine may be used to restrict the reach of Fourteenth Amendment Due Process . For me , this is just as unacceptable constitutional doctrine as is the use of the " incorporation " approach to impose upon the States all the requirements of the Bill of Rights as found in the provisions of the first eight amendments and in the decisions of this Court interpreting them . See , e.g. , my concurring opinions in Pointer v. Texas , 380 U.S. 400 , 408 , and Griffin v. California , 380 U.S. 609 , 615 , and my dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman , 367 U.S. 497 , 522 , at pp . 539 - 545 .	amendmentxiv
In my view , the proper constitutional inquiry in this case is whether this Connecticut statute infringes the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the enactment violates basic values " implicit in the concept of ordered liberty , " Palko v. Connecticut , 302 U.S. 319 , 325 . For reasons stated at length in my dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman , supra , I believe that it does . While the relevant inquiry may be aided by resort to one or more of the provisions of the Bill of Rights , it is not dependent on them or any of their radiations . The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment stands , in my opinion , on its own bottom .	amendmentxiv
A further observation seems in order respecting the justification of my Brothers BLACK and STEWART for their " incorporation " approach to this case . Their approach does not rest on historical reasons , which are , of course , wholly lacking ( see Fairman , Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of Rights ? The Original Understanding , 2 Stan . L.Rev . 5 ( 1949 ) ) , but on the thesis that , by limiting the content of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the protection of rights which can be found elsewhere in the Constitution , in this instance , in the Bill of Rights , judges will thus be confined to " interpretation " of specific constitutional [ p501 ] provisions , and will thereby be restrained from introducing their own notions of constitutional right and wrong into the " vague contours of the Due Process Clause . " Rochin v. California , 342 U.S. 165 , 170 . While I could not more heartily agree that judicial " self - restraint " is an indispensable ingredient of sound constitutional adjudication , I do submit that the formula suggested for achieving it is more hollow than real . " Specific " provisions of the Constitution , no less than " due process , " lend themselves as readily to " personal " interpretations by judges whose constitutional outlook is simply to keep the Constitution in supposed " tune with the times " ( post , p. 522 ) . Need one go further than to recall last Term 's reapportionment cases , Wesberry v. Sanders , 376 U.S. 1 , and Reynolds v. Sims , 377 U.S. 533 , where a majority of the Court " interpreted " " by the People " ( Art . I , § 2 ) and " equal protection " ( Amdt . 14 ) to command " one person , one vote , " an interpretation that was made in the face of irrefutable and still unanswered history to the contrary ? See my dissenting opinions in those cases , 376 U.S. at 20 ; 377 U.S. at 589 .	amendmentxiv
Judicial self - restraint will not , I suggest , be brought about in the " due process " area by the historically unfounded incorporation formula long advanced by my Brother BLACK , and now in part espoused by my Brother STEWART . It will be achieved in this area , as in other constitutional areas , only by continual insistence upon respect for the teachings of history , solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society , and wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms . See Adamson v. California , 332 U.S. 46 , 59 ( Mr. Justice Frankfurter , concurring ) . Adherence to these principles will not , of course , obviate all constitutional differences of opinion among judges , nor should it . Their continued recognition [ p502 ] will , however , go farther toward keeping most judges from roaming at large in the constitutional field than will the interpolation into the Constitution of an artificial and largely illusory restriction on the content of the Due Process Clause .

In my view , this Connecticut law , as applied to married couples , deprives them of " liberty " without due process of law , as that concept is used in the Fourteenth Amendment .

It would be unduly repetitious , and belaboring the obvious , to expound on the impact of this statute on the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment against arbitrary or capricious denials or on the nature of this liberty . Suffice it to say that this is not the first time this Court has had occasion to articulate that the liberty entitled to protection under the Fourteenth Amendment includes the right " to marry , establish a home and bring up children , " Meyer v. Nebraska , 262 U.S. 390 , 399 , and " the liberty . . . to direct the upbringing and education of children , " Pierce v. Society of Sisters , 268 U.S. 510 , 534 - 535 , and that these are among " the basic civil rights of man . " Skinner v. Oklahoma , 316 U.S. 535 , 541 . These decisions affirm that there is a " realm of family life which the state can not enter " without substantial justification . Prince v. Massachusetts , 321 U.S. 158 , 166 .

The Connecticut anti - contraceptive statute deals rather substantially with this relationship . For it forbids all married persons the right to use birth control devices , regardless of whether their use is dictated by considerations of family planning , Trubek v. Ullman , 147 Conn. 633 , 165 A.2d 158 , health , or indeed even of life itself . Buxton v. Ullman , 147 Conn. 48 , 156 A.2d 508 . The anti - use statute , together with the general aiding and abetting statute , prohibits doctors from affording advice to married persons on proper and effective methods of birth control . Tileston v. Ullman , 129 Conn. 84 , 26 A.2d 582 . And the clear effect of these statutes , as enforced , is to deny disadvantaged citizens of Connecticut , those without either adequate knowledge or resources to obtain private counseling , access to medical assistance and up - to - date information in respect to proper methods of birth control . State v. Nelson , 126 Conn. 412 , 11 A.2d 856 ; State v. Griswold , 151 Conn. 544 , 200 A.2d 479 . In my view , a statute with these effects bears a substantial burden of justification when attacked under the Fourteenth Amendment . Yick Wo v. Hopkins , 118 U.S. 356 ; Skinner v. Oklahoma , 316 U.S. 535 ; Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners , 353 U.S. 232 ; McLaughlin v. Florida , 379 U.S. 184 , 192 .	amendmentxiv
An examination of the justification offered , however , can not be avoided by saying that the Connecticut anti - use statute invades a protected area of privacy and association or that it demeans the marriage relationship . The nature of the right invaded is pertinent , to be sure , for statutes regulating sensitive areas of liberty do , under [ p504 ] the cases of this Court , require " strict scrutiny , " Skinner v. Oklahoma , 316 U.S. 535 , 541 , and " must be viewed in the light of less drastic means for achieving the same basic purpose . " Shelton v. Tucker , 364 U.S. 479 , 488 .	amendmentxiv
Bates v. Little Rock , 361 U.S. 516 , 524 . See also McLaughlin v. Florida , 379 U.S. 184 . But such statutes , if reasonably necessary for the effectuation of a legitimate and substantial state interest , and not arbitrary or capricious in application , are not invalid under the Due Process Clause .

As I read the opinions of the Connecticut courts and the argument of Connecticut in this Court , the State claims but one justification for its anti - use statute . Cf . Allied Stores of Ohio v. Bowers , 358 U.S. 522 , 530 ; Martin v. Walton , 368 U.S. 25 , 28 ( DOUGLAS , J. , dissenting ) . There is no serious contention that Connecticut thinks the use of artificial or external methods of contraception immoral or unwise in itself , or that the anti - use statute is founded upon any policy of promoting population expansion . Rather , the statute is said to serve the State 's policy against all forms of promiscuous or illicit sexual relationships , be they premarital or extramarital , concededly a permissible and legitimate legislative goal .	unmatched
Without taking issue with the premise that the fear of conception operates as a deterrent to such relationships in addition to the criminal proscriptions Connecticut has against such conduct , I wholly fail to see how the ban on the use of contraceptives by married couples in any way reinforces the State 's ban on illicit sexual relationships . See Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners , 353 U.S. 232 , 239 . Connecticut does not bar the importation or possession of contraceptive devices ; they are not considered contraband material under state law , State v. Certain Contraceptive Materials , 126 Conn. 428 , 11 A.2d 863 , and their availability in that State is not seriously disputed . The only way Connecticut seeks to limit or control the availability of such devices is through its general aiding and abetting statute , whose operation in this context has [ p506 ] been quite obviously ineffective , and whose most serious use has been against birth control clinics rendering advice to married , rather than unmarried , persons . Cf . Yick Wo v. Hopkins , 118 U.S. 356 . Indeed , after over 80 years of the State 's proscription of use , the legality of the sale of such devices to prevent disease has never been expressly passed upon , although it appears that sales have long occurred and have only infrequently been challenged . This " undeviating policy . . . throughout all the long years . . . bespeaks more than prosecutorial paralysis . " Poe v. Ullman , 367 U.S. 497 , 502 . Moreover , it would appear that the sale of contraceptives to prevent disease is plainly legal under Connecticut law .	unmatched
In these circumstances , one is rather hard pressed to explain how the ban on use by married persons in any way prevents use of such devices by persons engaging in illicit sexual relations , and thereby contributes to the State 's policy against such relationships . Neither the state courts nor the State before the bar of this Court has tendered such an explanation . It is purely fanciful to believe that the broad proscription on use facilitates discovery of use by persons engaging in a prohibited relationship , or for some other reason makes such use more unlikely , and thus can be supported by any sort of administrative consideration . Perhaps the theory is that the flat ban on use prevents married people from possessing contraceptives and , without the ready availability of such devices for use in the marital relationship , there will be no or less temptation to use them in extramarital ones . This reasoning rests on the premise that married people will comply with the ban in regard to their marital relationship , notwithstanding total nonenforcement in this context and apparent nonenforcibility , but will not comply with criminal statutes prohibiting extramarital affairs and the anti - use statute in respect to illicit sexual relationships , a premise whose validity has not been [ p507 ] demonstrated and whose intrinsic validity is not very evident . At most , the broad ban is of marginal utility to the declared objective . A statute limiting its prohibition on use to persons engaging in the prohibited relationship would serve the end posited by Connecticut in the same way , and with the same effectiveness or ineffectiveness , as the broad anti - use statute under attack in this case . I find nothing in this record justifying the sweeping scope of this statute , with its telling effect on the freedoms of married persons , and therefore conclude that it deprives such persons of liberty without due process of law .	amendmentxiv

MR . JUSTICE BLACK , with whom MR . JUSTICE STEWART joins , dissenting .	unmatched
I agree with my Brother STEWART 's dissenting opinion . And , like him , I do not to any extent whatever base my view that this Connecticut law is constitutional on a belief that the law is wise , or that its policy is a good one . In order that there may be no room at all to doubt why I vote as I do , I feel constrained to add that the law is every bit as offensive to me as it is to my Brethren of the majority and my Brothers HARLAN , WHITE and GOLDBERG , who , reciting reasons why it is offensive to them , hold it unconstitutional . There is no single one of the graphic and eloquent strictures and criticisms fired at the policy of this Connecticut law either by the Court 's opinion or by those of my concurring Brethren to which I can not subscribe -- except their conclusion that the evil qualities they see in the law make it unconstitutional .	unmatched
Had the doctor defendant here , or even the nondoctor defendant , been convicted for doing nothing more than expressing opinions to persons coming to the clinic that certain contraceptive devices , medicines or practices would do them good and would be desirable , or for telling people how devices could be used , I can think of no reasons at this time why their expressions of views would not be [ p508 ] protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments , which guarantee freedom of speech . Cf . Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel . Virginia State Bar , 377 U.S. 1 ; NAACP v. Button , 371 U.S. 415 . But speech is one thing ; conduct and physical activities are quite another . See , e.g. , Cox v. Louisiana , 379 U.S. 536 , 554 - 555 ; Cox v. Louisiana , 379 U.S. 559 , 563 - 564 ; i d . 575 - 584 ( concurring opinion ) ; Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co. , 336 U.S. 490 ; cf . Reynolds v. United States , 98 U.S. 145 , 163 - 164 . The two defendants here were active participants in an organization which gave physical examinations to women , advised them what kind of contraceptive devices or medicines would most likely be satisfactory for them , and then supplied the devices themselves , all for a graduated scale of fees , based on the family income . Thus , these defendants admittedly engaged with others in a planned course of conduct to help people violate the Connecticut law . Merely because some speech was used in carrying on that conduct -- just as , in ordinary life , some speech accompanies most kinds of conduct -- we are not , in my view , justified in holding that the First Amendment forbids the State to punish their conduct . Strongly as I desire to protect all First Amendment freedoms , I am unable to stretch the Amendment so as to afford protection to the conduct of these defendants in violating the Connecticut law . What would be the constitutional fate of the law if hereafter applied to punish nothing but speech is , as I have said , quite another matter . The Court talks about a constitutional " right of privacy " as though there is some constitutional provision or provisions forbidding any law ever to be passed which might abridge the " privacy " of individuals . But there is not . There are , of course , guarantees in certain specific constitutional provisions which are designed in part to protect privacy at certain times and places with respect to certain activities . Such , for example , is the Fourth [ p509 ] Amendment 's guarantee against " unreasonable searches and seizures . " But I think it belittles that Amendment to talk about it as though it protects nothing but " privacy . " To treat it that way is to give it a niggardly interpretation , not the kind of liberal reading I think any Bill of Rights provision should be given . The average man would very likely not have his feelings soothed any more by having his property seized openly than by having it seized privately and by stealth . He simply wants his property left alone . And a person can be just as much , if not more , irritated , annoyed and injured by an unceremonious public arrest by a policeman as he is by a seizure in the privacy of his office or home .	amendmentxiv,fourth_amendment,first_amendment
One of the most effective ways of diluting or expanding a constitutionally guaranteed right is to substitute for the crucial word or words of a constitutional guarantee another word or words , more or less flexible and more or less restricted in meaning . This fact is well illustrated by the use of the term " right of privacy " as a comprehensive substitute for the Fourth Amendment 's guarantee against " unreasonable searches and seizures . " " Privacy " is a broad , abstract and ambiguous concept which can easily be shrunken in meaning but which can also , on the other hand , easily be interpreted as a constitutional ban against many things other than searches and seizures . I have expressed the view many times that First Amendment freedoms , for example , have suffered from a failure of the courts to stick to the simple language of the First Amendment in construing it , instead of invoking multitudes of words substituted for those the Framers used . See , e.g. , New York Times Co. v. Sullivan , 376 U.S. 254 , 293 ( concurring opinion ) ; cases collected in City of El Paso v. Simmons , 379 U.S. 497 , 517 , n. 1 ( dissenting opinion ) ; Black , The Bill of Rights , 35 N.Y.U.L.Rev . 865 . For these reasons , I get nowhere in this case by talk about a constitutional " right of privacy " as an emanation from [ p510 ] one or more constitutional provisions . [ n1 ] I like my privacy as well as the next one , but I am nevertheless compelled to admit that government has a right to . invade it unless prohibited by some specific constitutional provision . For these reasons , I can not agree with the Court 's judgment and the reasons it gives for holding this Connecticut law unconstitutional .	fourth_amendment,first_amendment
This brings me to the arguments made by my Brothers HARLAN , WHITE and GOLDBERG for invalidating the Connecticut law . Brothers HARLAN [ n2 ] and WHITE would invalidate it by reliance on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment , but Brother GOLDBERG , while agreeing with Brother HARLAN , relies also on the Ninth Amendment . I have no doubt that the Connecticut law could be applied in such a way as to abridge freedom of [ p511 ] speech and press , and therefore violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments . My disagreement with the Court 's opinion holding that there is such a violation here is a narrow one , relating to the application of the First Amendment to the facts and circumstances of this particular case . But my disagreement with Brothers HARLAN , WHITE and GOLDBERG is more basic . I think that , if properly construed , neither the Due Process Clause nor the Ninth Amendment , nor both together , could under any circumstances be a proper basis for invalidating the Connecticut law . I discuss the due process and Ninth Amendment arguments together because , on analysis , they turn out to be the same thing -- merely using different words to claim for this Court and the federal judiciary power to invalidate any legislative act which the judges find irrational , unreasonable or offensive .	amendmentxiv,ninth_amendment,first_amendment
The due process argument which my Brothers HARLAN and WHITE adopt here is based , as their opinions indicate , on the premise that this Court is vested with power to invalidate all state laws that it considers to be arbitrary , capricious , unreasonable , or oppressive , or on this Court 's belief that a particular state law under scrutiny has no " rational or justifying " purpose , or is offensive to a " sense of fairness and justice . " [ n3 ] If these formulas based on " natural justice , " or others which mean the same thing , [ n4 ] are to prevail , they require judges to determine [ p512 ] what is or is not constitutional on the basis of their own appraisal of what laws are unwise or unnecessary . The power to make such decisions is , of course , that of a legislative body . Surely it has to be admitted that no provision of the Constitution specifically gives such blanket power to courts to exercise such a supervisory veto over the wisdom and value of legislative policies and to hold unconstitutional those laws which they believe unwise or dangerous . I readily admit that no legislative body , state or national , should pass laws that can justly be given any [ p513 ] of the invidious labels invoked as constitutional excuses to strike down state laws . But perhaps it is not too much to say that no legislative body ever does pass laws without believing that they will accomplish a sane , rational , wise and justifiable purpose . While I completely subscribe to the holding of Marbury v. Madison , 1 Cranch 137 , and subsequent cases , that our Court has constitutional power to strike down statutes , state or federal , that violate commands of the Federal Constitution , I do not believe that we are granted power by the Due Process Clause or any other constitutional provision or provisions to measure constitutionality by our belief that legislation is arbitrary , capricious or unreasonable , or accomplishes no justifiable purpose , or is offensive to our own notions of " civilized standards of conduct . " [ n5 ] Such an appraisal of the wisdom of legislation is an attribute of the power to make laws , not of the power to interpret them . The use by federal courts of such a formula or doctrine or whatnot to veto federal or state laws simply takes away from Congress and States the power to make laws based on their own judgment of fairness and wisdom , and transfers that power to this Court for ultimate determination -- a power which was specifically denied to federal courts by the convention that framed the Constitution . [ n6 ] [ p514 ]	amendmentxiv
Of the cases on which my Brothers WHITE and GOLDBERG rely so heavily , undoubtedly the reasoning of two of them supports their result here -- as would that of a number of others which they do not bother to name , e.g. , [ p515 ] Lochner v. New York , 198 U.S. 45 , Coppage v. Kansas , 236 U.S. 1 , Jay Burns Baking Co. v. Bryan , 264 U.S. 504 , and Adkins v. Children 's Hospital , 261 U.S. 525 . The two they do cite and quote from , Meyer v. Nebraska , 262 U.S. 390 , and Pierce v. Society of Sisters , 268 U.S. 510 , were both decided in opinions by Mr. Justice McReynolds which elaborated the same natural law due process philosophy found in Lochner v. New York , supra , one of the cases on which he relied in Meyer , along with such other long - discrSyllabus & Opinions Onlys as , e.g. , Adams v. Tanner , 244 U.S. 590 , and Adkins v. Children 's Hospital , supra . Meyer held unconstitutional , as an " arbitrary " and unreasonable interference with the right of a teacher to carry on his occupation and of parents to hire him , a [ p516 ] state law forbidding the teaching of modern foreign languages to young children in the schools . [ n7 ] And in Pierce , relying principally on Meyer , Mr. Justice McReynolds said that a state law requiring that all children attend public schools interfered unconstitutionally with the property rights of private school corporations because it was an " arbitrary , unreasonable and unlawful interference " which threatened " destruction of their business and property . " 268 U.S. at 536 . Without expressing an opinion as to whether either of those cases reached a correct result in light of our later decisions applying the First Amendment to the States through the Fourteenth , [ n8 ] I merely point out that the reasoning stated in Meyer and Pierce was the same natural law due process philosophy which many later opinions repudiated , and which I can not accept . Brothers WHITE and GOLDBERG also cite other cases , such as NAACP v. Button , 371 U.S. 415 , Shelton v. Tucker , 364 U.S. 479 , and Schneider v. State , 308 U.S. 147 , which held that States in regulating conduct could not , consistently with the First Amendment as applied to them by the Fourteenth , pass unnecessarily broad laws which might indirectly infringe on First Amendment freedoms . [ n9 ] See Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel . [ p517 ] Virginia State Bar , 377 U.S. 1 , 7 - 8 . [ n10 ] Brothers WHITE and GOLDBERG now apparently would start from this requirement that laws be narrowly drafted so as not to curtail free speech and assembly , and extend it limitlessly to require States to justify any law restricting " liberty " as my Brethren define " liberty . " This would mean at the [ p518 ] very least , I suppose , that every state criminal statute -- since it must inevitably curtail " liberty " to some extent -- would be suspect , and would have to be Justified to this Court . [ n11 ]	unmatched
My Brother GOLDBERG has adopted the recent discovery [ n12 ] that the Ninth Amendment as well as the Due Process Clause can be used by this Court as authority to strike down all state legislation which this Court thinks [ p519 ] violates " fundamental principles of liberty and justice , " or is contrary to the " traditions and [ collective ] conscience of our people . " He also states , without proof satisfactory to me , that , in making decisions on this basis , judges will not consider " their personal and private notions . " One may ask how they can avoid considering them . Our Court certainly has no machinery with which to take a Gallup Poll . [ n13 ] And the scientific miracles of this age have not yet produced a gadget which the Court can use to determine what traditions are rooted in the " [ collective ] conscience of our people . " Moreover , one would certainly have to look far beyond the language of the Ninth Amendment [ n14 ] to find that the Framers vested in this Court any such awesome veto powers over lawmaking , either by the States or by the Congress . Nor does anything in the history of the Amendment offer any support for such a shocking doctrine . The whole history of the adoption of the Constitution and Bill of Rights points the other way , and the very material quoted by my Brother GOLDBERG shows that the Ninth Amendment was intended to protect against the idea that , " by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power " to the Federal Government , " those rights which were not singled out were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government [ the United States ] , and were consequently [ p520 ] insecure . " [ n15 ] That Amendment was passed not to broaden the powers of this Court or any other department of " the General Government , " but , as every student of history knows , to assure the people that the Constitution in all its provisions was intended to limit the Federal Government to the powers granted expressly or by necessary implication . If any broad , unlimited power to hold laws unconstitutional because they offend what this Court conceives to be the " [ collective ] conscience of our people " is vested in this Court by the Ninth Amendment , the Fourteenth Amendment , or any other provision of the Constitution , it was not given by the Framers , but rather has been bestowed on the Court by the Court . This fact is perhaps responsible for the peculiar phenomenon that , for a period of a century and a half , no serious suggestion was ever made that the Ninth Amendment , enacted to protect state powers against federal invasion , could be used as a weapon of federal power to prevent state legislatures from passing laws they consider appropriate to govern local affairs . Use of any such broad , unbounded judicial authority would make of this Court 's members a day - to - day constitutional convention .	amendmentxiv,ninth_amendment
I repeat , so as not to be misunderstood , that this Court does have power , which it should exercise , to hold laws unconstitutional where they are forbidden by the Federal Constitution . My point is that there is no provision [ p521 ] of the Constitution which either expressly or impliedly vests power in this Court to sit as a supervisory agency over acts of duly constituted legislative bodies and set aside their laws because of the Court 's belief that the legislative policies adopted are unreasonable , unwise , arbitrary , capricious or irrational . The adoption of such a loose flexible . uncontrolled standard for holding laws unconstitutional , if ever it is finally achieved , will amount to a great unconstitutional shift of power to the courts which I believe and am constrained to say will be bad for the courts , and worse for the country . Subjecting federal and state laws to such an unrestrained and unrestrainable judicial control as to the wisdom of legislative enactments would , I fear , jeopardize the separation of governmental powers that the Framers set up , and , at the same time , threaten to take away much of the power of States to govern themselves which the Constitution plainly intended them to have .

I realize that many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written , sometimes in rhapsodical strains , about the duty of this Court to keep the Constitution in tune with the times . The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time , and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes . For myself , I must , with all deference , reject that philosophy . The Constitution makers knew the need for change , and provided for it . Amendments suggested by the people 's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification . That method of change was good for our Fathers , and , being somewhat old - fashioned , I must add it is good enough for me . And so I can not rely on the Due Process Clause or the Ninth Amendment or any mysterious and uncertain natural law concept as a reason for striking down this state law . The Due Process Clause , with an " arbitrary and capricious " or " shocking to the conscience " formula , was liberally used by this Court to strike down economic legislation in the early decades of this century , threatening , many people thought , the tranquility and stability of the Nation . See , e.g. , Lochner v. New York , 198 U.S. 45 . That formula , based on subjective considerations of " natural justice , " is no less dangerous when used to enforce this Court 's views about personal rights than those about economic rights . I had thought that we had laid that formula , as a means for striking down state legislation , to rest once and for all in cases like West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish , 300 U.S. 379 ; Olsen v. Nebraska ex rel . Western Reference & Bond Assn . , 313 U.S. 236 , and many other [ p523 ] opinions . [ n17 ] See also Lochner v.

Apparently my Brethren have less quarrel with state economic regulations than former Justices of their persuasion had .

MR . JUSTICE STEWART , whom MR . JUSTICE BLACK joins , dissenting .	unmatched
Since 1879 , Connecticut has had on its books a law which forbids the use of contraceptives by anyone . I think this is an uncommonly silly law . As a practical matter , the law is obviously unenforceable , except in the oblique context of the present case . As a philosophical matter , I believe the use of contraceptives in the relationship of marriage should be left to personal and private choice , based upon each individual 's moral , ethical , and religious beliefs . As a matter of social policy , I think professional counsel about methods of birth control should be available to all , so that each individual 's choice can be meaningfully made . But we are not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise , or even asinine . We are asked to hold that it violates the United States Constitution . And that I can not do .	unmatched
In the course of its opinion , the Court refers to no less than six Amendments to the Constitution : the First , the Third , the Fourth , the Fifth , the Ninth , and the Fourteenth . [ p528 ] But the Court does not say which of these Amendments , if any , it thinks is infringed by this Connecticut law .	first_amendment,amendmentxiv,fifth_amendment,third_amendment,fourth_amendment,ninth_amendment
We are told that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not , as such , the " guide " in this case . With that much , I agree . There is no claim that this law , duly enacted by the Connecticut Legislature , is unconstitutionally vague . There is no claim that the appellants were denied any of the elements of procedural due process at their trial , so as to make their convictions constitutionally invalid . And , as the Court says , the day has long passed since the Due Process Clause was regarded as a proper instrument for determining " the wisdom , need , and propriety " of state laws .

As to the First , Third , Fourth , and Fifth Amendments , I can find nothing in any of them to invalidate this Connecticut law , even assuming that all those Amendments are fully applicable against the States .

The Court also quotes the Ninth Amendment , and my Brother GOLDBERG 's concurring opinion relies heavily upon it . But to say that the Ninth Amendment has anything to do with this case is to turn somersaults with history . The Ninth Amendment , like its companion , the Tenth , which this Court held " states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered , " United States v. Darby , 312 U.S. 100 , 124 , was framed by James Madison and adopted by the States simply to make clear that the adoption of the Bill of Rights did not alter the plan that [ p530 ] the Federal Government was to be a government of express and limited powers , and that all rights and powers not delegated to it were retained by the people and the individual States . Until today , no member of this Court has ever suggested that the Ninth Amendment meant anything else , and the idea that a federal court could ever use the Ninth Amendment to annul a law passed by the elected representatives of the people of the State of Connecticut would have caused James Madison no little wonder .	ninth_amendment
What provision of the Constitution , then , does make this state law invalid ? The Court says it is the right of privacy " created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees . " With all deference , I can find no such general right of privacy in the Bill of Rights , in any other part of the Constitution , or in any case ever before decided by this Court . [ n7 ]	unmatched
At the oral argument in this case , we were told that the Connecticut law does not " conform to current community standards . " But it is not the function of this Court to decide cases on the basis of community standards . We are here to decide cases " agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States . " It is the essence of judicial [ p531 ] duty to subordinate our own personal views , our own ideas of what legislation is wise and what is not . If , as I should surely hope , the law before us does not reflect he standards of the people of Connecticut , the people of Connecticut can freely exercise their true Ninth and Tenth Amendment rights to persuade their elected representatives to repeal it . That is the constitutional way to take this law off the books . [ n8 ]	tenth_amendment,ninth_amendment
The Court does not say how far the new constitutional right of privacy announced today extends . See , e.g. , Mueller , Legal Regulation of Sexual Conduct , at 127 ; Ploscowe , Sex and the Law , at 189 . I suppose , however , that , even after today , a State can constitutionally still punish at least some offenses which are not committed in public .	unmatched
In each of these cases , the defendant , while in police custody , was questioned by police officers , detectives , or a prosecuting attorney in a room in which he was cut off from the outside world . None of the defendants was given a full and effective warning of his rights at the outset of the interrogation process .

MR . CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court .	unmatched
The cases before us raise questions which go to the roots of our concepts of American criminal jurisprudence : the restraints society must observe consistent with the Federal Constitution in prosecuting individuals for crime . More specifically , we deal with the admissibility of statements obtained from an individual who is subjected to custodial police interrogation and the necessity for procedures which assure that the individual is accorded his privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution not to be compelled to incriminate himself . [ p440 ]	fifth_amendment
We dealt with certain phases of this problem recently in Escobedo v. Illinois , 378 U.S. 478 ( 1964 ) . There , as in the four cases before us , law enforcement officials took the defendant into custody and interrogated him in a police station for the purpose of obtaining a confession . The police did not effectively advise him of his right to remain silent or of his right to consult with his attorney . Rather , they confronted him with an alleged accomplice who accused him of having perpetrated a murder . When the defendant denied the accusation and said " I did n't shoot Manuel , you did it , " they handcuffed him and took him to an interrogation room . There , while handcuffed and standing , he was questioned for four hours until he confessed . During this interrogation , the police denied his request to speak to his attorney , and they prevented his retained attorney , who had come to the police station , from consulting with him . At his trial , the State , over his objection , introduced the confession against him . We held that the statements thus made were constitutionally inadmissible .	unmatched
This case has been the subject of judicial interpretation and spirited legal debate since it was decided two years ago . Both state and federal courts , in assessing its implications , have arrived at varying conclusions . [ n1 ] A wealth of scholarly material has been written tracing its ramifications and underpinnings . [ n2 ] Police and prosecutor [ p441 ] have speculated on its range and desirability . [ n3 ] We granted certiorari in these cases , 382 U.S. 924 , 925 , 937 , in order further to explore some facets of the problems thus exposed of applying the privilege against self - incrimination to in - custody interrogation , and to give [ p442 ] concrete constitutional guidelines for law enforcement agencies and courts to follow .	fifth_amendment
We start here , as we did in Escobedo , with the premise that our holding is not an innovation in our jurisprudence , but is an application of principles long recognized and applied in other settings . We have undertaken a thorough reexamination of the Escobedo decision and the principles it announced , and we reaffirm it . That case was but an explication of basic rights that are enshrined in our Constitution -- that " No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , " and that " the accused shall . . . have the Assistance of Counsel " -- rights which were put in jeopardy in that case through official overbearing . These precious rights were fixed in our Constitution only after centuries of persecution and struggle . And , in the words of Chief Justice Marshall , they were secured " for ages to come , and . . . designed to approach immortality as nearly as human institutions can approach it , " Cohens v. Virginia , 6 Wheat . 264 , 387 ( 1821 ) .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
Over 70 years ago , our predecessors on this Court eloquently stated :	unmatched
Brown v. Walker , 161 U.S. 591 , 596 - 597 ( 1896 ) . In stating the obligation of the judiciary to apply these constitutional rights , this Court declared in Weems v. United States , 217 U.S. 349 , 373 ( 1910 ) :	unmatched
This was the spirit in which we delineated , in meaningful language , the manner in which the constitutional rights of the individual could be enforced against overzealous police practices . It was necessary in Escobedo , as here , to insure that what was proclaimed in the Constitution had not become but a " form of words , " Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States , 251 U.S. 385 , 392 ( 1920 ) , in the hands of government officials . And it is in this spirit , consistent with our role as judges , that we adhere to the principles of Escobedo today .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
Our holding will be spelled out with some specificity in the pages which follow , but , briefly stated , it is this : the prosecution may not use statements , whether exculpatory or inculpatory , stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self - incrimination . By custodial interrogation , we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way . [ n4 ] As for the procedural safeguards to be employed , unless other fully effective means are devised to inform accused persons of their right of silence and to assure a continuous opportunity to exercise it , the following measures are required . Prior to any questioning , the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent , that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him , and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney , either retained or appointed . The defendant may waive effectuation of these rights , provided the waiver is made voluntarily , knowingly and intelligently . If , however , he indicates in any manner and at any stage of the [ p445 ] process that he wishes to consult with an attorney before speaking , there can be no questioning . Likewise , if the individual is alone and indicates in any manner that he does not wish to be interrogated , the police may not question him . The mere fact that he may have answered some questions or volunteered some statements on his own does not deprive him of the right to refrain from answering any further inquiries until he has consulted with an attorney and thereafter consents to be questioned .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
The constitutional issue we decide in each of these cases is the admissibility of statements obtained from a defendant questioned while in custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way . In each , the defendant was questioned by police officers , detectives , or a prosecuting attorney in a room in which he was cut off from the outside world . In none of these cases was the defendant given a full and effective warning of his rights at the outset of the interrogation process . In all the cases , the questioning elicited oral admissions , and in three of them , signed statements as well which were admitted at their trials . They all thus share salient features -- incommunicado interrogation of individuals in a police - dominated atmosphere , resulting in self - incriminating statements without full warnings of constitutional rights .	fifth_amendment
An understanding of the nature and setting of this in - custody interrogation is essential to our decisions today . The difficulty in depicting what transpires at such interrogations stems from the fact that , in this country , they have largely taken place incommunicado . From extensive factual studies undertaken in the early 1930 's , including the famous Wickersham Report to Congress by a Presidential Commission , it is clear that police violence and the " third degree " flourished at that time . [ n5 ] [ p446 ] In a series of cases decided by this Court long after these studies , the police resorted to physical brutality -- beating , hanging , whipping -- and to sustained and protracted questioning incommunicado in order to extort confessions . [ n6 ] The Commission on Civil Rights in 1961 found much evidence to indicate that " some policemen still resort to physical force to obtain confessions , " 1961 Comm'n on Civil Rights Rep. Justice , pt . 5 , 17 . The use of physical brutality and violence is not , unfortunately , relegated to the past or to any part of the country . Only recently in Kings County , New York , the police brutally beat , kicked and placed lighted cigarette butts on the back of a potential witness under interrogation for the purpose of securing a statement incriminating a third party . People v. Portelli , 15 N.Y.2d 235 , 205 N.E.2d 857 , 257 N.Y.S.2d 931 ( 1965 ) . [ n7 ] [ p447 ]	unmatched
The examples given above are undoubtedly the exception now , but they are sufficiently widespread to be the object of concern . Unless a proper limitation upon custodial interrogation is achieved -- such as these decisions will advance -- there can be no assurance that practices of this nature will be eradicated in the foreseeable future . The conclusion of the Wickersham Commission Report , made over 30 years ago , is still pertinent :	unmatched
It is not admissible to do a great right by doing a little wrong . . . . It is not sufficient to do justice by obtaining a proper result by irregular or improper means .	unmatched
The third degree brutalizes the police , hardens the prisoner against society , and lowers the esteem in which the administration of Justice is held by the public .	unmatched
Again we stress that the modern practice of in - custody interrogation is psychologically , rather than physically , oriented . As we have stated before ,	unmatched
Blackburn v. Alabama , 361 U.S. 199 , 206 ( 1960 ) . Interrogation still takes place in privacy . Privacy results in secrecy , and this , in turn , results in a gap in our knowledge as to what , in fact , goes on in the interrogation rooms . A valuable source of information about present police practices , however , may be found in various police manuals and texts which document procedures employed with success in the past , and which recommend various other effective tactics . [ n8 ] These [ p449 ] texts are used by law enforcement agencies themselves as guides . [ n9 ] It should be noted that these texts professedly present the most enlightened and effective means presently used to obtain statements through custodial interrogation . By considering these texts and other data , it is possible to describe procedures observed and noted around the country .	unmatched
The officers are told by the manuals that the	unmatched
The efficacy of this tactic has been explained as follows :	unmatched
To highlight the isolation and unfamiliar surroundings , the manuals instruct the police to display an air of confidence in the suspect 's guilt and , from outward appearance , to maintain only an interest in confirming certain details . The guilt of the subject is to be posited as a fact . The interrogator should direct his comments toward the reasons why the subject committed the act , rather than court failure by asking the subject whether he did it . Like other men , perhaps the subject has had a bad family life , had an unhappy childhood , had too much to drink , had an unrequited desire for women . The officers are instructed to minimize the moral seriousness of the offense , [ n12 ] to cast blame on the victim or on society . [ n13 ] These tactics are designed to put the subject in a psychological state where his story is but an elaboration of what the police purport to know already -- that he is guilty . Explanations to the contrary are dismissed and discouraged .	unmatched
The texts thus stress that the major qualities an interrogator should possess are patience and perseverance . [ p451 ] One writer describes the efficacy of these characteristics in this manner :	unmatched
The manuals suggest that the suspect be offered legal excuses for his actions in order to obtain an initial admission of guilt . Where there is a suspected revenge killing , for example , the interrogator may say :	unmatched
Having then obtained the admission of shooting , the interrogator is advised to refer to circumstantial evidence which negates the self - defense explanation . This should enable him to secure the entire story . One text notes that ,	unmatched
When the techniques described above prove unavailing , the texts recommend they be alternated with a show of some hostility . One ploy often used has been termed the " friendly - unfriendly , " or the " Mutt and Jeff " act :	unmatched
The interrogators sometimes are instructed to induce a confession out of trickery . The technique here is quite effective in crimes which require identification or which run in series . In the identification situation , the interrogator may take a break in his questioning to place the subject among a group of men in a line - up .	unmatched
Then the questioning resumes " as though there were now no doubt about the guilt of the subject . " A variation on this technique is called the " reverse line - up " :	unmatched
The manuals also contain instructions for police on how to handle the individual who refuses to discuss the matter entirely , or who asks for an attorney or relatives . The examiner is to concede him the right to remain silent .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
After this psychological conditioning , however , the officer is told to point out the incriminating significance of the suspect 's refusal to talk :	unmatched
Few will persist in their initial refusal to talk , it is said , if this monologue is employed correctly .	unmatched
In the event that the subject wishes to speak to a relative or an attorney , the following advice is tendered :	sixth_amendment
From these representative samples of interrogation techniques , the setting prescribed by the manuals and observed in practice becomes clear . In essence , it is this : to be alone with the subject is essential to prevent distraction and to deprive him of any outside support . The aura of confidence in his guilt undermines his will to resist . He merely confirms the preconceived story the police seek to have him describe . Patience and persistence , at times relentless questioning , are employed . To obtain a confession , the interrogator must " patiently maneuver himself or his quarry into a position from which the desired objective may be attained . " [ n23 ] When normal procedures fail to produce the needed result , the police may resort to deceptive stratagems such as giving false legal advice . It is important to keep the subject off balance , for example , by trading on his insecurity about himself or his surroundings . The police then persuade , trick , or cajole him out of exercising his constitutional rights .	unmatched
Even without employing brutality , the " third degree " or the specific stratagems described above , the very fact of custodial interrogation exacts a heavy toll on individual liberty , and trades on the weakness of individuals . [ n24 ] [ p456 ] This fact may be illustrated simply by referring to three confession cases decided by this Court in the Term immediately preceding our Escobedo decision . In Townsend v. Sain , 372 U.S. 293 ( 1963 ) , the defendant was a 19-year - old heroin addict , described as a " near mental defective , " i d . at 307 - 310 . The defendant in Lynumn v. Illinois , 372 U.S. 528 ( 1963 ) , was a woman who confessed to the arresting officer after being importuned to " cooperate " in order to prevent her children from being taken by relief authorities . This Court , as in those cases , reversed the conviction of a defendant in Haynes v. Washington , 373 U.S. 503 ( 1963 ) , whose persistent request during his interrogation was to phone his wife or attorney . [ n25 ] In other settings , these individuals might have exercised their constitutional rights . In the incommunicado police - dominated atmosphere , they succumbed .	unmatched
In the cases before us today , given this background , we concern ourselves primarily with this interrogation atmosphere and the evils it can bring . In No . 759 , Miranda v. Arizona , the police arrested the defendant and took him to a special interrogation room , where they secured a confession . In No . 760 , Vignera v. New York , the defendant made oral admissions to the police after interrogation in the afternoon , and then signed an inculpatory statement upon being questioned by an assistant district attorney later the same evening . In No . 761 , Westover v. United States , the defendant was handed over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation by [ p457 ] local authorities after they had detained and interrogated him for a lengthy period , both at night and the following morning . After some two hours of questioning , the federal officers had obtained signed statements from the defendant . Lastly , in No . 584 , California v. Stewart , the local police held the defendant five days in the station and interrogated him on nine separate occasions before they secured his inculpatory statement .	unmatched
In these cases , we might not find the defendants ' statements to have been involuntary in traditional terms . Our concern for adequate safeguards to protect precious Fifth Amendment rights is , of course , not lessened in the slightest . In each of the cases , the defendant was thrust into an unfamiliar atmosphere and run through menacing police interrogation procedures . The potentiality for compulsion is forcefully apparent , for example , in Miranda , where the indigent Mexican defendant was a seriously disturbed individual with pronounced sexual fantasies , and in Stewart , in which the defendant was an indigent Los Angeles Negro who had dropped out of school in the sixth grade . To be sure , the records do not evince overt physical coercion or patent psychological ploys . The fact remains that in none of these cases did the officers undertake to afford appropriate safeguards at the outset of the interrogation to insure that the statements were truly the product of free choice .	fifth_amendment
It is obvious that such an interrogation environment is created for no purpose other than to subjugate the individual to the will of his examiner . This atmosphere carries its own badge of intimidation . To be sure , this is not physical intimidation , but it is equally destructive of human dignity . [ n26 ] The current practice of incommunicado interrogation is at odds with one of our [ p458 ] Nation 's most cherished principles -- that the individual may not be compelled to incriminate himself . Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings , no statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice .	unmatched
From the foregoing , we can readily perceive an intimate connection between the privilege against self - incrimination and police custodial questioning . It is fitting to turn to history and precedent underlying the Self - Incrimination Clause to determine its applicability in this situation .	fifth_amendment
We sometimes forget how long it has taken to establish the privilege against self - incrimination , the sources from which it came , and the fervor with which it was defended . Its roots go back into ancient times . [ n27 ] Perhaps [ p459 ] the critical historical event shedding light on its origins and evolution was the trial of one John Lilburn , a vocal anti - Stuart Leveller , who was made to take the Star Chamber Oath in 1637 . The oath would have bound him to answer to all questions posed to him on any subject . The Trial of John Lilburn and John Wharton , 3 How . St . Tr . 1315 ( 1637 ) . He resisted the oath and declaimed the proceedings , stating :	fifth_amendment

On account of the Lilburn Trial , Parliament abolished the inquisitorial Court of Star Chamber and went further in giving him generous reparation . The lofty principles to which Lilburn had appealed during his trial gained popular acceptance in England . [ n28 ] These sentiments worked their way over to the Colonies , and were implanted after great struggle into the Bill of Rights . [ n29 ] Those who framed our Constitution and the Bill of Rights were ever aware of subtle encroachments on individual liberty . They knew that	unmatched
Boyd v. United States , 116 U.S. 616 , 635 ( 1886 ) . The privilege was elevated to constitutional status , and has always been " as broad as the mischief [ p460 ] against which it seeks to guard . " Counselman v. Hitchcock , 142 U.S. 547 , 562 ( 1892 ) . We can not depart from this noble heritage .	fifth_amendment
Thus , we may view the historical development of the privilege as one which groped for the proper scope of governmental power over the citizen . As a " noble principle often transcends its origins , " the privilege has come rightfully to be recognized in part as an individual 's substantive right , a " right to a private enclave where he may lead a private life . That right is the hallmark of our democracy . " United States v. Grunewald , 233 F.2d 556 , 579 , 581 - 582 ( Frank , J. , dissenting ) , rev'd , 353 U.S. 391 ( 1957 ) . We have recently noted that the privilege against self - incrimination -- the essential mainstay of our adversary system -- is founded on a complex of values , Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n , 378 U.S. 52 , 55 - 57 , n. 5 ( 1964 ) ; Tehan v. Shott , 382 U.S. 406 , 414 - 415 , n. 12 ( 1966 ) . All these policies point to one overriding thought : the constitutional foundation underlying the privilege is the respect a government -- state or federal -- must accord to the dignity and integrity of its citizens . To maintain a " fair state - individual balance , " to require the government " to shoulder the entire load , " 8 Wigmore , Evidence 317 ( McNaughton rev.1961 ) , to respect the inviolability of the human personality , our accusatory system of criminal justice demands that the government seeking to punish an individual produce the evidence against him by its own independent labors , rather than by the cruel , simple expedient of compelling it from his own mouth . Chambers v. Florida , 309 U.S. 227 , 235 - 238 ( 1940 ) . In sum , the privilege is fulfilled only when the person is guaranteed the right " to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will . " Malloy v. Hogan , 378 U.S. 1 , 8 ( 1964 ) .	fifth_amendment
The question in these cases is whether the privilege is fully applicable during a period of custodial interrogation . [ p461 ] In this Court , the privilege has consistently been accorded a liberal construction . Albertson v. SACB , 382 U.S. 70 , 81 ( 1965 ) ; Hoffman v. United States , 341 U.S. 479 , 486 ( 1951 ) ; Arndstein v. McCarthy , 254 U.S. 71 , 72 - 73 ( 1920 ) ; Counselman v. Hitchock , 142 U.S. 547 , 562 ( 1892 ) . We are satisfied that all the principles embodied in the privilege apply to informal compulsion exerted by law enforcement officers during in - custody questioning . An individual swept from familiar surroundings into police custody , surrounded by antagonistic forces , and subjected to the techniques of persuasion described above can not be otherwise than under compulsion to speak . As a practical matter , the compulsion to speak in the isolated setting of the police station may well be greater than in courts or other official investigations , where there are often impartial observers to guard against intimidation or trickery .

This question , in fact , could have been taken as settled in federal courts almost 70 years ago , when , in Bram v. United States , 168 U.S. 532 , 542 ( 1897 ) , this Court held :	unmatched
In Bram , the Court reviewed the British and American history and case law and set down the Fifth Amendment standard for compulsion which we implement today :	fifth_amendment

The Court has adhered to this reasoning . In 1924 , Mr. Justice Brandeis wrote for a unanimous Court in reversing a conviction resting on a compelled confession , Wan v. United States , 266 U.S. 1 . He stated :	unmatched
266 U.S. at 14 - 15 . In addition to the expansive historical development of the privilege and the sound policies which have nurtured [ p463 ] its evolution , judicial precedent thus clearly establishes its application to incommunicado interrogation . In fact , the Government concedes this point as well established in No . 761 , Westover v. United States , stating :	fifth_amendment
Because of the adoption by Congress of Rule 5(a ) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure , and this Court 's effectuation of that Rule in McNabb v. United States , 318 U.S. 332 ( 1943 ) , and Mallory v. United States , 354 U.S. 449 ( 1957 ) , we have had little occasion in the past quarter century to reach the constitutional issues in dealing with federal interrogations . These supervisory rules , requiring production of an arrested person before a commissioner " without unnecessary delay " and excluding evidence obtained in default of that statutory obligation , were nonetheless responsive to the same considerations of Fifth Amendment policy that unavoidably face us now as to the States . In McNabb , 318 U.S. at 343 - 344 , and in Mallory , 354 U.S. at 455 - 456 , we recognized both the dangers of interrogation and the appropriateness of prophylaxis stemming from the very fact of interrogation itself . [ n32 ]	fifth_amendment
Our decision in Malloy v. Hogan , 378 U.S. 1 ( 1964 ) , necessitates an examination of the scope of the privilege in state cases as well . In Malloy , we squarely held the [ p464 ] privilege applicable to the States , and held that the substantive standards underlying the privilege applied with full force to state court proceedings . There , as in Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n , 378 U.S. 52 ( 1964 ) , and Griffin v. California , 380 U.S. 609 ( 1965 ) , we applied the existing Fifth Amendment standards to the case before us . Aside from the holding itself , the reasoning in Malloy made clear what had already become apparent -- that the substantive and procedural safeguards surrounding admissibility of confessions in state cases had become exceedingly exacting , reflecting all the policies embedded in the privilege , 378 U.S. at 7 - 8 . [ n33 ] The voluntariness doctrine in the state cases , as Malloy indicates , encompasses all interrogation practices which are likely to exert such pressure upon an individual as to disable him from [ p465 ] making a free and rational choice . [ n34 ] The implications of this proposition were elaborated in our decision in Escobedo v. Illinois , 378 U.S. 478 , decided one week after Malloy applied the privilege to the States .	fifth_amendment
Our holding there stressed the fact that the police had not advised the defendant of his constitutional privilege to remain silent at the outset of the interrogation , and we drew attention to that fact at several points in the decision , 378 U.S. at 483 , 485 , 491 . This was no isolated factor , but an essential ingredient in our decision . The entire thrust of police interrogation there , as in all the cases today , was to put the defendant in such an emotional state as to impair his capacity for rational judgment . The abdication of the constitutional privilege -- the choice on his part to speak to the police -- was not made knowingly or competently because of the failure to apprise him of his rights ; the compelling atmosphere of the in - custody interrogation , and not an independent decision on his part , caused the defendant to speak .	fifth_amendment
A different phase of the Escobedo decision was significant in its attention to the absence of counsel during the questioning . There , as in the cases today , we sought a protective device to dispel the compelling atmosphere of the interrogation . In Escobedo , however , the police did not relieve the defendant of the anxieties which they had created in the interrogation rooms . Rather , they denied his request for the assistance of counsel , 378 U.S. at 481 , 488 , 491 . [ n35 ] This heightened his dilemma , and [ p466 ] made his later statements the product of this compulsion . Cf . Haynes v. Washington , 373 U.S. 503 , 514 ( 1963 ) . The denial of the defendant 's request for his attorney thus undermined his ability to exercise the privilege -- to remain silent if he chose or to speak without any intimidation , blatant or subtle . The presence of counsel , in all the cases before us today , would he the adequate protective device necessary to make the process of police interrogation conform to the dictates of the privilege . His presence would insure that statements made in the government - established atmosphere are not the product of compulsion .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
It was in this manner that Escobedo explicated another facet of the pretrial privilege , noted in many of the Court 's prior decisions : the protection of rights at trial . [ n36 ] That counsel is present when statements are taken from an individual during interrogation obviously enhances the integrity of the factfinding processes in court . The presence of an attorney , and the warnings delivered to the individual , enable the defendant under otherwise compelling circumstances to tell his story without fear , effectively , and in a way that eliminates the evils in the interrogation process . Without the protections flowing from adequate warnings and the rights of counsel ,	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
Mapp v. Ohio , 367 U.S. 643 , 685 ( 1961 ) ( HARLAN , J. , dissenting ) . Cf . Pointer v. Texas , 380 U.S. 400 ( 1965 ) . [ p467 ]	unmatched
Today , then , there can be no doubt that the Fifth Amendment privilege is available outside of criminal court proceedings , and serves to protect persons in all settings in which their freedom of action is curtailed in any significant way from being compelled to incriminate themselves . We have concluded that , without proper safeguards , the process of in - custody interrogation of persons suspected or accused of crime contains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual 's will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely . In order to combat these pressures and to permit a full opportunity to exercise the privilege against self - incrimination , the accused must be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights , and the exercise of those rights must be fully honored .	fifth_amendment
It is impossible for us to foresee the potential alternatives for protecting the privilege which might be devised by Congress or the States in the exercise of their creative rulemaking capacities . Therefore , we can not say that the Constitution necessarily requires adherence to any particular solution for the inherent compulsions of the interrogation process as it is presently conducted . Our decision in no way creates a constitutional straitjacket which will handicap sound efforts at reform , nor is it intended to have this effect . We encourage Congress and the States to continue their laudable search for increasingly effective ways of protecting the rights of the individual while promoting efficient enforcement of our criminal laws . However , unless we are shown other procedures which are at least as effective in apprising accused persons of their right of silence and in assuring a continuous opportunity to exercise it , the following safeguards must be observed .	fifth_amendment
At the outset , if a person in custody is to be subjected to interrogation , he must first be informed in clear and [ p468 ] unequivocal terms that he has the right to remain silent . For those unaware of the privilege , the warning is needed simply to make them aware of it -- the threshold requirement for an intelligent decision as to its exercise . More important , such a warning is an absolute prerequisite in overcoming the inherent pressures of the interrogation atmosphere . It is not just the subnormal or woefully ignorant who succumb to an interrogator 's imprecations , whether implied or expressly stated , that the interrogation will continue until a confession is obtained or that silence in the face of accusation is itself damning , and will bode ill when presented to a jury . [ n37 ] Further , the warning will show the individual that his interrogators are prepared to recognize his privilege should he choose to exercise it .	fifth_amendment
The Fifth Amendment privilege is so fundamental to our system of constitutional rule , and the expedient of giving an adequate warning as to the availability of the privilege so simple , we will not pause to inquire in individual cases whether the defendant was aware of his rights without a warning being given . Assessments of the knowledge the defendant possessed , based on information [ p469 ] as to his age , education , intelligence , or prior contact with authorities , can never be more than speculation ; [ n38 ] a warning is a clear - cut fact . More important , whatever the background of the person interrogated , a warning at the time of the interrogation is indispensable to overcome its pressures and to insure that the individual knows he is free to exercise the privilege at that point in time .	fifth_amendment
The warning of the right to remain silent must be accompanied by the explanation that anything said can and will be used against the individual in court . This warning is needed in order to make him aware not only of the privilege , but also of the consequences of forgoing it . It is only through an awareness of these consequences that there can be any assurance of real understanding and intelligent exercise of the privilege . Moreover , this warning may serve to make the individual more acutely aware that he is faced with a phase of the adversary system -- that he is not in the presence of persons acting solely in his interest .	fifth_amendment
The circumstances surrounding in - custody interrogation can operate very quickly to overbear the will of one merely made aware of his privilege by his interrogators . Therefore , the right to have counsel present at the interrogation is indispensable to the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege under the system we delineate today . Our aim is to assure that the individual 's right to choose between silence and speech remains unfettered throughout the interrogation process . A once - stated warning , delivered by those who will conduct the interrogation , can not itself suffice to that end among those who most require knowledge of their rights . A mere [ p470 ] warning given by the interrogators is not alone sufficient to accomplish that end . Prosecutors themselves claim that the admonishment of the right to remain silent , without more , " will benefit only the recidivist and the professional . " Brief for the National District Attorneys Association as amicus curiae , p. 14 . Even preliminary advice given to the accused by his own attorney can be swiftly overcome by the secret interrogation process . Cf . Escobedo v. Illinois , 378 U.S. 478 , 485 , n. 5 . Thus , the need for counsel to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege comprehends not merely a right to consult with counsel prior to questioning , but also to have counsel present during any questioning if the defendant so desires .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
The presence of counsel at the interrogation may serve several significant subsidiary functions , as well . If the accused decides to talk to his interrogators , the assistance of counsel can mitigate the dangers of untrustworthiness . With a lawyer present , the likelihood that the police will practice coercion is reduced , and , if coercion is nevertheless exercised , the lawyer can testify to it in court . The presence of a lawyer can also help to guarantee that the accused gives a fully accurate statement to the police , and that the statement is rightly reported by the prosecution at trial . See Crooker v. California , 357 U.S. 433 , 443 - 448 ( 1958 ) ( DOUGLAS , J. , dissenting ) .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
An individual need not make a pre - interrogation request for a lawyer . While such request affirmatively secures his right to have one , his failure to ask for a lawyer does not constitute a waiver . No effective waiver of the right to counsel during interrogation can be recognized unless specifically made after the warnings we here delineate have been given . The accused who does not know his rights and therefore does not make a request [ p471 ] may be the person who most needs counsel . As the California Supreme Court has aptly put it :	sixth_amendment
People v. Dorado , 62 Cal.2d 338 , 351 , 398 P.2d 361 , 369 - 370 , 42 Cal . Rptr . 169 , 177 - 178 ( 1965 ) ( Tobriner , J. ) . In Carnley v. Cochran , 369 U.S. 506 , 513 ( 1962 ) , we stated :	unmatched
This proposition applies with equal force in the context of providing counsel to protect an accused 's Fifth Amendment privilege in the face of interrogation . [ n39 ] Although the role of counsel at trial differs from the role during interrogation , the differences are not relevant to the question whether a request is a prerequisite .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
Accordingly , we hold that an individual held for interrogation must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation under the system for protecting the privilege we delineate today . As with the warnings of the right to remain silent and that anything stated can be used in evidence against him , this warning is an absolute prerequisite to interrogation . No amount of [ p472 ] circumstantial evidence that the person may have been aware of this right will suffice to stand in its stead . Only through such a warning is there ascertainable assurance that the accused was aware of this right .	sixth_amendment
If an individual indicates that he wishes the assistance of counsel before any interrogation occurs , the authorities can not rationally ignore or deny his request on the basis that the individual does not have or can not afford a retained attorney . The financial ability of the individual has no relationship to the scope of the rights involved here . The privilege against self - incrimination secured by the Constitution applies to all individuals . The need for counsel in order to protect the privilege exists for the indigent as well as the affluent . In fact , were we to limit these constitutional rights to those who can retain an attorney , our decisions today would be of little significance . The cases before us , as well as the vast majority of confession cases with which we have dealt in the past , involve those unable to retain counsel . [ n40 ] While authorities are not required to relieve the accused of his poverty , they have the obligation not to take advantage of indigence in the administration of justice . [ n41 ] Denial [ p473 ] of counsel to the indigent at the time of interrogation while allowing an attorney to those who can afford one would be no more supportable by reason or logic than the similar situation at trial and on appeal struck down in Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U.S. 335 ( 1963 ) , and Douglas v. California , 372 U.S. 353 ( 1963 ) .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
In order fully to apprise a person interrogated of the extent of his rights under this system , then , it is necessary to warn him not only that he has the right to consult with an attorney , but also that , if he is indigent , a lawyer will be appointed to represent him . Without this additional warning , the admonition of the right to consult with counsel would often be understood as meaning only that he can consult with a lawyer if he has one or has the funds to obtain one . The warning of a right to counsel would be hollow if not couched in terms that would convey to the indigent -- the person most often subjected to interrogation -- the knowledge that he too has a right to have counsel present . [ n42 ] As with the warnings of the right to remain silent and of the general right to counsel , only by effective and express explanation to the indigent of this right can there be assurance that he was truly in a position to exercise it . [ n43 ]	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
Once warnings have been given , the subsequent procedure is clear . If the individual indicates in any manner , [ p474 ] at any time prior to or during questioning , that he wishes to remain silent , the interrogation must cease . [ n44 ] At this point , he has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege ; any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege can not be other than the product of compulsion , subtle or otherwise . Without the right to cut off questioning , the setting of in - custody interrogation operates on the individual to overcome free choice in producing a statement after the privilege has been once invoked . If the individual states that he wants an attorney , the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present . At that time , the individual must have an opportunity to confer with the attorney and to have him present during any subsequent questioning . If the individual can not obtain an attorney and he indicates that he wants one before speaking to police , they must respect his decision to remain silent .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
This does not mean , as some have suggested , that each police station must have a " station house lawyer " present at all times to advise prisoners . It does mean , however , that , if police propose to interrogate a person , they must make known to him that he is entitled to a lawyer and that , if he can not afford one , a lawyer will be provided for him prior to any interrogation . If authorities conclude that they will not provide counsel during a reasonable period of time in which investigation in the field is carried out , they may refrain from doing so without violating the person 's Fifth Amendment privilege so long as they do not question him during that time . [ p475 ]	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
If the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken , a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self - incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel . Escobedo v. Illinois , 378 U.S. 478 , 490 , n. 14 . This Court has always set high standards of proof for the waiver of constitutional rights , Johnson v. Zerbst , 304 U.S. 458 ( 1938 ) , and we reassert these standards as applied to in - custody interrogation . Since the State is responsible for establishing the isolated circumstances under which the interrogation takes place , and has the only means of making available corroborated evidence of warnings given during incommunicado interrogation , the burden is rightly on its shoulders .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
An express statement that the individual is willing to make a statement and does not want an attorney , followed closely by a statement , could constitute a waiver . But a valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after warnings are given , or simply from the fact that a confession was , in fact , eventually obtained . A statement we made in Carnley v. Cochran , 369 U.S. 506 , 516 ( 1962 ) , is applicable here :	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
See also Glasser v. United States , 315 U.S. 60 ( 1942 ) . Moreover , where in - custody interrogation is involved , there is no room for the contention that the privilege is waived if the individual answers some questions or gives [ p476 ] some information on his own prior to invoking his right to remain silent when interrogated . [ n45 ]	fifth_amendment
Whatever the testimony of the authorities as to waiver of rights by an accused , the fact of lengthy interrogation or incommunicado incarceration before a statement is made is strong evidence that the accused did not validly waive his rights . In these circumstances , the fact that the individual eventually made a statement is consistent with the conclusion that the compelling influence of the interrogation finally forced him to do so . It is inconsistent with any notion of a voluntary relinquishment of the privilege . Moreover , any evidence that the accused was threatened , tricked , or cajoled into a waiver will , of course , show that the defendant did not voluntarily waive his privilege . The requirement of warnings and waiver of rights is a fundamental with respect to the Fifth Amendment privilege , and not simply a preliminary ritual to existing methods of interrogation .	fifth_amendment
The warnings required and the waiver necessary in accordance with our opinion today are , in the absence of a fully effective equivalent , prerequisites to the admissibility of any statement made by a defendant . No distinction can be drawn between statements which are direct confessions and statements which amount to " admissions " of part or all of an offense . The privilege against self - incrimination protects the individual from being compelled to incriminate himself in any manner ; it does not distinguish degrees of incrimination . Similarly , [ p477 ] for precisely the same reason , no distinction may be drawn between inculpatory statements and statements alleged to be merely " exculpatory . " If a statement made were , in fact , truly exculpatory , it would , of course , never be used by the prosecution . In fact , statements merely intended to be exculpatory by the defendant are often used to impeach his testimony at trial or to demonstrate untruths in the statement given under interrogation , and thus to prove guilt by implication . These statements are incriminating in any meaningful sense of the word , and may not be used without the full warnings and effective waiver required for any other statement . In Escobedo itself , the defendant fully intended his accusation of another as the slayer to be exculpatory as to himself .	fifth_amendment
The principles announced today deal with the protection which must be given to the privilege against self - incrimination when the individual is first subjected to police interrogation while in custody at the station or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way . It is at this point that our adversary system of criminal proceedings commences , distinguishing itself at the outset from the inquisitorial system recognized in some countries . Under the system of warnings we delineate today , or under any other system which may be devised and found effective , the safeguards to be erected about the privilege must come into play at this point .	fifth_amendment
Our decision is not intended to hamper the traditional function of police officers in investigating crime . See Escobedo v. Illinois , 378 U.S. 478 , 492 . When an individual is in custody on probable cause , the police may , of course , seek out evidence in the field to be used at trial against him . Such investigation may include inquiry of persons not under restraint . General on - the - scene questioning as to facts surrounding a crime or other general questioning of citizens in the factfinding process is not affected by our holding . It is an act of [ p478 ] responsible citizenship for individuals to give whatever information they may have to aid in law enforcement . In such situations , the compelling atmosphere inherent in the process of in - custody interrogation is not necessarily present . [ n46 ]	unmatched
In dealing with statements obtained through interrogation , we do not purport to find all confessions inadmissible . Confessions remain a proper element in law enforcement . Any statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is , of course , admissible in evidence . The fundamental import of the privilege while an individual is in custody is not whether he is allowed to talk to the police without the benefit of warnings and counsel , but whether he can be interrogated . There is no requirement that police stop a person who enters a police station and states that he wishes to confess to a crime , [ n47 ] or a person who calls the police to offer a confession or any other statement he desires to make . Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment , and their admissibility is not affected by our holding today .	fifth_amendment
To summarize , we hold that , when an individual is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning , the privilege against self - incrimination is jeopardized . Procedural safeguards must be employed to [ p479 ] protect the privilege , and unless other fully effective means are adopted to notify the person of his right of silence and to assure that the exercise of the right will be scrupulously honored , the following measures are required . He must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent , that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law , that he has the right to the presence of an attorney , and that , if he can not afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires . Opportunity to exercise these rights must be afforded to him throughout the interrogation . After such warnings have been given , and such opportunity afforded him , the individual may knowingly and intelligently waive these rights and agree to answer questions or make a statement . But unless and until such warnings and waiver are demonstrated by the prosecution at trial , no evidence obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against him . [ n48 ]	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
A recurrent argument made in these cases is that society 's need for interrogation outweighs the privilege . This argument is not unfamiliar to this Court . See , e.g. , Chambers v. Florida , 309 U.S. 227 , 240 - 241 ( 1940 ) . The whole thrust of our foregoing discussion demonstrates that the Constitution has prescribed the rights of the individual when confronted with the power of government when it provided in the Fifth Amendment that an individual can not be compelled to be a witness against himself . That right can not be abridged . As Mr. Justice Brandeis once observed :	fifth_amendment
Olmstead v. United States , 277 U.S. 438 , 485 ( 1928 ) ( dissenting opinion ) . [ n49 ] In this connection , one of our country 's distinguished jurists has pointed out : " The quality of a nation 's civilization can be largely measured by the methods it uses in the enforcement of its criminal law . " [ n50 ]	unmatched
If the individual desires to exercise his privilege , he has the right to do so . This is not for the authorities to decide . An attorney may advise his client not to talk to police until he has had an opportunity to investigate the case , or he may wish to be present with his client during any police questioning . In doing so an attorney is merely exercising the good professional judgment he has been taught . This is not cause for considering the attorney a menace to law enforcement . He is merely carrying out what he is sworn to do under his oath -- to protect to the extent of his ability the rights of his client . [ p481 ] In fulfilling this responsibility , the attorney plays a vital role in the administration of criminal justice under our Constitution .	fifth_amendment
In announcing these principles , we are not unmindful of the burdens which law enforcement officials must bear , often under trying circumstances . We also fully recognize the obligation of all citizens to aid in enforcing the criminal laws . This Court , while protecting individual rights , has always given ample latitude to law enforcement agencies in the legitimate exercise of their duties . The limits we have placed on the interrogation process should not constitute an undue interference with a proper system of law enforcement . As we have noted , our decision does not in any way preclude police from carrying out their traditional investigatory functions . Although confessions may play an important role in some convictions , the cases before us present graphic examples of the overstatement of the " need " for confessions . In each case , authorities conducted interrogations ranging up to five days in duration despite the presence , through standard investigating practices , of considerable evidence against each defendant . [ n51 ] Further examples are chronicled in our prior cases . See , e.g. , Haynes v. Washington , 373 U.S. 503 , 518 - 519 ( 1963 ) ; Rogers v. Richmond , 365 U.S. 534 , 541 ( 1961 ) ; Malinski v. New York , 324 U.S. 401,402 ( 1945 ) . [ n52 ] [ p482 ]	unmatched
It is also urged that an unfettered right to detention for interrogation should be allowed because it will often redound to the benefit of the person questioned . When police inquiry determines that there is no reason to believe that the person has committed any crime , it is said , he will be released without need for further formal procedures . The person who has committed no offense , however , will be better able to clear himself after warnings with counsel present than without . It can be assumed that , in such circumstances , a lawyer would advise his client to talk freely to police in order to clear himself .	unmatched
Custodial interrogation , by contrast , does not necessarily afford the innocent an opportunity to clear themselves . A serious consequence of the present practice of the interrogation alleged to be beneficial for the innocent is that many arrests " for investigation " subject large numbers of innocent persons to detention and interrogation . In one of the cases before us , No . 584 , California v. Stewart , police held four persons , who were in the defendant 's house at the time of the arrest , in jail for five days until defendant confessed . At that time , they were finally released . Police stated that there was " no evidence to connect them with any crime . " Available statistics on the extent of this practice where it is condoned indicate that these four are far from alone in being subjected to arrest , prolonged detention , and interrogation without the requisite probable cause . [ n53 ] [ p483 ]	unmatched
Over the years , the Federal Bureau of Investigation has compiled an exemplary record of effective law enforcement while advising any suspect or arrested person , at the outset of an interview , that he is not required to make a statement , that any statement may be used against him in court , that the individual may obtain the services of an attorney of his own choice , and , more recently , that he has a right to free counsel if he is unable to pay . [ n54 ] A letter received from the Solicitor General in response to a question from the Bench makes it clear that the present pattern of warnings and respect for the [ p484 ] rights of the individual followed as a practice by the FBI is consistent with the procedure which we delineate today . It states :	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
( 2 ) When is the warning given ?	unmatched
The practice of the FBI can readily be emulated by state and local enforcement agencies . The argument that the FBI deals with different crimes than are dealt with by state authorities does not mitigate the significance of the FBI experience . [ n56 ]	unmatched
The experience in some other countries also suggests that the danger to law enforcement in curbs on interrogation is overplayed . The English procedure , since 1912 under the Judges ' Rules , is significant . As recently [ p487 ] strengthened , the Rules require that a cautionary warning be given an accused by a police officer as soon as he has evidence that affords reasonable grounds for suspicion ; they also require that any statement made be given by the accused without questioning by police . [ n57 ] [ p488 ] The right of the individual to consult with an attorney during this period is expressly recognized . [ n58 ]	sixth_amendment
The safeguards present under Scottish law may be even greater than in England . Scottish judicial decisions bar use in evidence of most confessions obtained through police interrogation . [ n59 ] In India , confessions made to police not in the presence of a magistrate have been excluded [ p489 ] by rule of evidence since 1872 , at a time when it operated under British law . [ n60 ] Identical provisions appear in the Evidence Ordinance of Ceylon , enacted in 1895 . [ n61 ] Similarly , in our country , the Uniform Code of Military Justice has long provided that no suspect may be interrogated without first being warned of his right not to make a statement , and that any statement he makes may be used against him . [ n62 ] Denial of the right to consult counsel during interrogation has also been proscribed by military tribunals . [ n63 ] There appears to have been no marked detrimental effect on criminal law enforcement in these jurisdictions as a result of these rules . Conditions of law enforcement in our country are sufficiently similar to permit reference to this experience as assurance that lawlessness will not result from warning an individual of his rights or allowing him to exercise them . Moreover , it is consistent with our legal system that we give at least as much protection to these rights as is given in the jurisdictions described . We deal in our country with rights grounded in a specific requirement of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution , [ p490 ] whereas other jurisdictions arrived at their conclusions on the basis of principles of justice not so specifically defined . [ n64 ]	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
It is also urged upon us that we withhold decision on this issue until state legislative bodies and advisory groups have had an opportunity to deal with these problems by rulemaking . [ n65 ] We have already pointed out that the Constitution does not require any specific code of procedures for protecting the privilege against self - incrimination during custodial interrogation . Congress and the States are free to develop their own safeguards for the privilege , so long as they are fully as effective as those described above in informing accused persons of their right of silence and in affording a continuous opportunity to exercise it . In any event , however , the issues presented are of constitutional dimensions , and must be determined by the courts . The admissibility of a statement in the face of a claim that it was obtained in violation of the defendant 's constitutional rights is an issue the resolution of which has long since been undertaken by this Court . See Hopt v. Utah , 110 U.S. 574 ( 1884 ) . Judicial solutions to problems of constitutional dimension have evolved decade by decade . As courts have been presented with the need to enforce constitutional rights , they have found means of doing so . That was our responsibility when Escobedo was before us , and it is our [ p491 ] responsibility today . Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved , there can be no rulemaking or legislation which would abrogate them .	fifth_amendment
Because of the nature of the problem and because of its recurrent significance in numerous cases , we have to this point discussed the relationship of the Fifth Amendment privilege to police interrogation without specific concentration on the facts of the cases before us . We turn now to these facts to consider the application to these cases of the constitutional principles discussed above . In each instance , we have concluded that statements were obtained from the defendant under circumstances that did not meet constitutional standards for protection of the privilege .	fifth_amendment
No . 759 . Miranda v. Arizona	unmatched
On March 13 , 1963 , petitioner , Ernesto Miranda , was arrested at his home and taken in custody to a Phoenix police station . He was there identified by the complaining witness . The police then took him to " Interrogation Room No . 2 " of the detective bureau . There he was questioned by two police officers . The officers admitted at trial that Miranda was not advised that he had a right to have an attorney present . [ n66 ] Two hours later , the [ p492 ] officers emerged from the interrogation room with a written confession signed by Miranda . At the top of the statement was a typed paragraph stating that the confession was made voluntarily , without threats or promises of immunity and " with full knowledge of my legal rights , understanding any statement I make may be used against me . " [ n67 ]	sixth_amendment
At his trial before a jury , the written confession was admitted into evidence over the objection of defense counsel , and the officers testified to the prior oral confession made by Miranda during the interrogation . Miranda was found guilty of kidnapping and rape . He was sentenced to 20 to 30 years ' imprisonment on each count , the sentences to run concurrently . On appeal , the Supreme Court of Arizona held that Miranda 's constitutional rights were not violated in obtaining the confession , and affirmed the conviction . 98 Ariz. 18 , 401 P.2d 721 . In reaching its decision , the court emphasized heavily the fact that Miranda did not specifically request counsel .	unmatched
We reverse . From the testimony of the officers and by the admission of respondent , it is clear that Miranda was not in any way apprised of his right to consult with an attorney and to have one present during the interrogation , nor was his right not to be compelled to incriminate himself effectively protected in any other manner . Without these warnings , the statements were inadmissible . The mere fact that he signed a statement which contained a typed - in clause stating that he had " full knowledge " of his " legal rights " does not approach the knowing and intelligent waiver required to relinquish constitutional rights . Cf . Haynes v. Washington , 373 U.S. [ p493 ] 503 , 512 - 513 ( 1963 ) ; Haley v. Ohio , 332 U.S. 596 , 601 ( 1948 ) ( opinion of MR JUSTICE DOUGLAS ) .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
No . 760 . Vignera v. New York	unmatched
Petitioner , Michael Vignera , was picked up by New York police on October 14 , 1960 , in connection with the robbery three days earlier of a Brooklyn dress shop . They took him to the 17th Detective Squad headquarters in Manhattan . Sometime thereafter , he was taken to the 66th Detective Squad . There a detective questioned Vignera with respect to the robbery . Vignera orally admitted the robbery to the detective . The detective was asked on cross - examination at trial by defense counsel whether Vignera was warned of his right to counsel before being interrogated . The prosecution objected to the question , and the trial judge sustained the objection . Thus , the defense was precluded from making any showing that warnings had not been given . While at the 66th Detective Squad , Vignera was identified by the store owner and a saleslady as the man who robbed the dress shop . At about 3 p.m. , he was formally arrested . The police then transported him to still another station , the 70th Precinct in Brooklyn , " for detention . " At 11 p.m. , Vignera was questioned by an assistant district attorney in the presence of a hearing reporter , who transcribed the questions and Vignera 's answers . This verbatim account of these proceedings contains no statement of any warnings given by the assistant district attorney . At Vignera 's trial on a charge of first degree robbery , the detective testified as to the oral confession . The transcription of the statement taken was also introduced in evidence . At the conclusion of the testimony , the trial judge charged the jury in part as follows :	unmatched
Vignera was found guilty of first degree robbery . He was subsequently adjudged a third - felony offender and sentenced to 30 to 60 years ' imprisonment . [ n68 ] The conviction was affirmed without opinion by the Appellate Division , Second Department , 21 App . Div.2d 752 , 252 N.Y.S.2d 19 , and by the Court of Appeals , also without opinion , 15 N.Y.2d 970 , 207 N.E.2d 527 , 259 N.Y.S.2d 857 , remittitur amended , 16 N.Y.2d 614 , 209 N.E.2d 110 , 261 N.Y. .2d 65 . In argument to the Court of Appeals , the State contended that Vignera had no constitutional right to be advised of his right to counsel or his privilege against self - incrimination .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
We reverse . The foregoing indicates that Vignera was not warned of any of his rights before the questioning by the detective and by the assistant district attorney . No other steps were taken to protect these rights . Thus , he was not effectively apprised of his Fifth Amendment privilege or of his right to have counsel present , and his statements are inadmissible .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
No . 761 . Westover v. United States	unmatched
At approximately 9:45 p.m. on March 20 , 1963 , petitioner , Carl Calvin Westover , was arrested by local police in Kansas City as a suspect in two Kansas City robberies . A report was also received from the FBI that he was wanted on a felony charge in California . The local authorities took him to a police station and placed him in a line - up on the local charges , and , at about 11:45 p.m. , he was booked . Kansas City police interrogated Westover [ p495 ] on the night of his arrest . He denied any knowledge of criminal activities . The next day , local officers interrogated him again throughout the morning . Shortly before noon , they informed the FBI that they were through interrogating Westover and that the FBI could proceed to interrogate him . There is nothing in the record to indicate that Westover was ever given any warning as to his rights by local police . At noon , three special agents of the FBI continued the interrogation in a private interview room of the Kansas City Police Department , this time with respect to the robbery of a savings and loan association and bank in Sacramento , California . After two or two and one - half hours , Westover signed separate confessions to each of these two robberies which had been prepared by one of the agents during the interrogation . At trial , one of the agents testified , and a paragraph on each of the statements states , that the agents advised Westover that he did not have to make a statement , that any statement he made could be used against him , and that he had the right to see an attorney .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
Westover was tried by a jury in federal court and convicted of the California robberies . His statements were introduced at trial . He was sentenced to 15 years ' imprisonment on each count , the sentences to run consecutively . On appeal , the conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit . 342 F.2d 684 .	unmatched
We reverse . On the facts of this case , we can not find that Westover knowingly and intelligently waived his right to remain silent and his right to consult with counsel prior to the time he made the statement . [ n69 ] At the [ p496 ] time the FBI agents began questioning Westover , he had been in custody for over 14 hours , and had been interrogated at length during that period . The FBI interrogation began immediately upon the conclusion of the interrogation by Kansas City police , and was conducted in local police headquarters . Although the two law enforcement authorities are legally distinct , and the crimes for which they interrogated Westover were different , the impact on him was that of a continuous period of questioning . There is no evidence of any warning given prior to the FBI interrogation , nor is there any evidence of an articulated waiver of rights after the FBI commenced its interrogation . The record simply shows that the defendant did , in fact , confess a short time after being turned over to the FBI following interrogation by local police . Despite the fact that the FBI agents gave warnings at the outset of their interview , from Westover 's point of view , the warnings came at the end of the interrogation process . In these circumstances , an intelligent waiver of constitutional rights can not be assumed .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
We do not suggest that law enforcement authorities are precluded from questioning any individual who has been held for a period of time by other authorities and interrogated by them without appropriate warnings . A different case would be presented if an accused were taken into custody by the second authority , removed both in time and place from his original surroundings , and then adequately advised of his rights and given an opportunity to exercise them . But here , the FBI interrogation was conducted immediately following the state interrogation in the same police station -- in the same compelling surroundings . Thus , in obtaining a confession from Westover [ p497 ] the federal authorities were the beneficiaries of the pressure applied by the local in - custody interrogation . In these circumstances , the giving of warnings alone was not sufficient to protect the privilege .	fifth_amendment
No . 584 . California v. Stewart	unmatched
In the course of investigating a series of purse - snatch robberies in which one of the victims had died of injuries inflicted by her assailant , respondent , Roy Allen Stewart , was pointed out to Los Angeles police as the endorser of dividend checks taken in one of the robberies . At about 7:15 p.m. , January 31 , 1963 , police officers went to Stewart 's house and arrested him . One of the officers asked Stewart if they could search the house , to which he replied , " Go ahead . " The search turned up various items taken from the five robbery victims . At the time of Stewart 's arrest , police also arrested Stewart 's wife and three other persons who were visiting him . These four were jailed along with Stewart , and were interrogated . Stewart was taken to the University Station of the Los Angeles Police Department , where he was placed in a cell . During the next five days , police interrogated Stewart on nine different occasions . Except during the first interrogation session , when he was confronted with an accusing witness , Stewart was isolated with his interrogators .	unmatched
During the ninth interrogation session , Stewart admitted that he had robbed the deceased and stated that he had not meant to hurt her . Police then brought Stewart before a magistrate for the first time . Since there was no evidence to connect them with any crime , the police then released the other four persons arrested with him .	unmatched
Nothing in the record specifically indicates whether Stewart was or was not advised of his right to remain silent or his right to counsel . In a number of instances , [ p498 ] however , the interrogating officers were asked to recount everything that was said during the interrogations . None indicated that Stewart was ever advised of his rights .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
Stewart was charged with kidnapping to commit robbery , rape , and murder . At his trial , transcripts of the first interrogation and the confession at the last interrogation were introduced in evidence . The jury found Stewart guilty of robbery and first degree murder , and fixed the penalty as death . On appeal , the Supreme Court of California reversed . 62 Cal.2d 571 , 400 P.2d 97 , 43 Cal . Rptr . 201 . It held that , under this Court 's decision in Escobedo , Stewart should have been advised of his right to remain silent and of his right to counsel , and that it would not presume in the face of a silent record that the police advised Stewart of his rights . [ n70 ]	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
We affirm . [ n71 ] In dealing with custodial interrogation , we will not presume that a defendant has been effectively apprised of his rights and that his privilege against self - incrimination has been adequately safeguarded on a record that does not show that any warnings have been given or that any effective alternative has been employed . Nor can a knowing and intelligent waiver of [ p499 ] these rights be assumed on a silent record . Furthermore , Stewart 's steadfast denial of the alleged offenses through eight of the nine interrogations over a period of five days is subject to no other construction than that he was compelled by persistent interrogation to forgo his Fifth Amendment privilege .	fifth_amendment
Therefore , in accordance with the foregoing , the judgments of the Supreme Court Of Arizona in No . 759 , of the New York Court of Appeals in No . 760 , and of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in No . 761 , are reversed . The judgment of the Supreme Court of California in No . 584 is affirmed .	unmatched

The decisions of this Court have guaranteed the same procedural protection for the defendant whether his confession was used in a federal or state court . It is now axiomatic that the defendant 's constitutional rights have been violated if his conviction is based , in whole or in part , on an involuntary confession , regardless of its truth or falsity .

United States , 168 U.S. 532 , 540 - 542 ( 1897 ) .

While a warning that the indigent may have counsel appointed need not be given to the person who is known to have an attorney or is known to have ample funds to secure one , the expedient of giving a warning is too simple , and the rights involved too important , to engage in ex post facto inquiries into financial ability when there is any doubt at all on that score .	sixth_amendment

MR . JUSTICE HARLAN , whom MR . JUSTICE STEWART and MR . JUSTICE WHITE join , dissenting .	unmatched
I believe the decision of the Court represents poor constitutional law and entails harmful consequences for the country at large . How serious these consequences may prove to be , only time can tell . But the basic flaws in the Court 's justification seem to me readily apparent now , once all sides of the problem are considered .	unmatched
At the outset , it is well to note exactly what is required by the Court 's new constitutional code of rules for confessions . The foremost requirement , upon which later admissibility of a confession depends , is that a four - fold warning be given to a person in custody before he is questioned , namely , that he has a right to remain silent , that anything he says may be used against him , that he has a right to have present an attorney during the questioning , and that , if indigent he has a right to a lawyer without charge . To forgo these rights , some affirmative statement of rejection is seemingly required , and threats , tricks , or cajolings to obtain this waiver are forbidden . If , before or during questioning , the suspect seeks to invoke his right to remain silent , interrogation must be forgone or cease ; a request for counsel [ p505 ] brings about the same result until a lawyer is procured . Finally , there are a miscellany of minor directives , for example , the burden of proof of waiver is on the State , admissions and exculpatory statements are treated just like confessions , withdrawal of a waiver is always permitted , and so forth . [ n1 ]	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
While the fine points of this scheme are far less clear than the Court admits , the tenor is quite apparent . The new rules are not designed to guard against police brutality or other unmistakably banned forms of coercion . Those who use third - degree tactics and deny them in court are equally able and destined to lie as skillfully about warnings and waivers . Rather , the thrust of the new rules is to negate all pressures , to reinforce the nervous or ignorant suspect , and ultimately to discourage any confession at all . The aim , in short , is toward " voluntariness " in a utopian sense , or , to view it from a different angle , voluntariness with a vengeance .	unmatched
To incorporate this notion into the Constitution requires a strained reading of history and precedent and a disregard of the very pragmatic concerns that alone may on occasion justify such strains . I believe that reasoned examination will show that the Due Process Clauses provide an adequate tool for coping with confessions , and that , even if the Fifth Amendment privilege against self - incrimination be invoked , its precedents , taken as a whole , do not sustain the present rules . Viewed as a choice based on pure policy , these new rules prove to be a highly debatable , if not one - sided , appraisal of the competing interests , imposed over widespread objection , at the very time when judicial restraint is most called for by the circumstances . [ p506 ]	fifth_amendment,amendmentxiv
It is most fitting to begin an inquiry into the constitutional precedents by surveying the limits on confessions the Court has evolved under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . This is so because these cases show that there exists a workable and effective means of dealing with confessions in a judicial manner ; because the cases are the baseline from which the Court now departs , and so serve to measure the actual , as opposed to the professed , distance it travels , and because examination of them helps reveal how the Court has coasted into its present position .	amendmentxiv
The earliest confession cases in this Court emerged from federal prosecutions , and were settled on a nonconstitutional basis , the Court adopting the common law rule that the absence of inducements , promises , and threats made a confession voluntary and admissible . Hopt v. Utah , 110 U.S. 574 ; Pierce v. United States , 160 U.S. 355 . While a later case said the Fifth Amendment privilege controlled admissibility , this proposition was not itself developed in subsequent decisions . [ n2 ] The Court did , however , heighten the test of admissibility in federal trials to one of voluntariness " in fact , " Wan v. [ p507 ] United States , 266 U.S. 1 , 14 ( quoted , ante p. 462 ) , and then , by and large , left federal judges to apply the same standards the Court began to derive in a string of state court cases .	fifth_amendment
This new line of decisions , testing admissibility by the Due Process Clause , began in 1936 with Brown v. Mississippi , 297 U.S. 278 , and must now embrace somewhat more than 30 full opinions of the Court . [ n3 ] While the voluntariness rubric was repeated in many instances , e.g. , Lyons v. Oklahoma , 322 U.S. 596 , the Court never pinned it down to a single meaning , but , on the contrary , infused it with a number of different values . To travel quickly over the main themes , there was an initial emphasis on reliability , e.g. , Ward v. Texas , 316 U.S. 547 , supplemented by concern over the legality and fairness of the police practices , e.g. , Ashcraft v. Tennessee , 322 U.S. 143 , in an " accusatorial " system of law enforcement , Watts v. Indiana , 338 U.S. 49 , 54 , and eventually by close attention to the individual 's state of mind and capacity for effective choice , e.g. , Gallegos v. Colorado , 370 U.S. 49 . The outcome was a continuing reevaluation on the facts of each case of how much pressure on the suspect was permissible . [ n4 ] [ p508 ]	amendmentxiv
Among the criteria often taken into account were threats or imminent danger , e.g. , Payne v. Arkansas , 356 U.S. 560 , physical deprivations such as lack of sleep or food , e.g. , Reck v. Pate , 367 U.S. 433 , repeated or extended interrogation , e.g. , Chambers v. Florida , 309 U.S. 227 , limits on access to counsel or friends , Crooker v. California , 357 U.S. 433 ; Cicenia v. Lagay , 357 U.S. 504 , length and illegality of detention under state law , e.g. , Haynes v. Washington , 373 U.S. 503 , and individual weakness or incapacities , Lynumn v. Illinois , 372 U.S. 528 . Apart from direct physical coercion , however , no single default or fixed combination of defaults guaranteed exclusion , and synopses of the cases would serve little use , because the overall gauge has been steadily changing , usually in the direction of restricting admissibility . But to mark just what point had been reached before the Court jumped the rails in Escobedo v. Illinois , 378 U.S. 478 , it is worth capsulizing the then - recent case of Haynes v. Washington , 373 U.S. 503 . There , Haynes had been held some 16 or more hours in violation of state law before signing the disputed confession , had received no warnings of any kind , and , despite requests , had been refused access to his wife or to counsel , the police indicating that access would be allowed after a confession . Emphasizing especially this last inducement and rejecting some contrary indicia of voluntariness , the Court in a 5-to-4 decision , held the confession inadmissible .	unmatched
There are several relevant lessons to be drawn from this constitutional history . The first is that , with over 25 years of precedent , the Court has developed an elaborate , sophisticated , and sensitive approach to admissibility of confessions . It is " judicial " in its treatment of one case at a time , see Culombe v. Connecticut , 367 U.S. 568 , 635 ( concurring opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE ) , flexible in its ability to respond to the endless mutations of fact presented , and ever more familiar to the lower courts . [ p509 ] Of course , strict certainty is not obtained in this developing process , but this is often so with constitutional principles , and disagreement is usually confined to that borderland of close cases where it matters least .	unmatched
The second point is that , in practice and , from time to time , in principle , the Court has given ample recognition to society 's interest in suspect questioning as an instrument of law enforcement . Cases countenancing quite significant pressures can be cited without difficulty , [ n5 ] and the lower courts may often have been yet more tolerant . Of course , the limitations imposed today were rejected by necessary implication in case after case , the right to warnings having been explicitly rebuffed in this Court many years ago . Powers v. United States , 223 U.S. 303 ; Wilson v. United States , 162 U.S. 613 . As recently as Haynes v. Washington , 373 U.S. 503 , 515 , the Court openly acknowledged that questioning of witnesses and suspects " is undoubtedly an essential tool in effective law enforcement . " Accord , Crooker v. California , 357 U.S. 433 , 441 .	unmatched
Finally , the cases disclose that the language in many of the opinions overstates the actual course of decision . It has been said , for example , that an admissible confession must be made by the suspect " in the unfettered exercise of his own will , " Malloy v. Hogan , 378 U.S. 1 , 8 , and that " a prisoner is not ‘ to be made the deluded instrument of his own conviction , ' " Culombe v. Connecticut , 367 U.S. 568 , 581 ( Frankfurter , J. , announcing the Court 's judgment and an opinion ) . Though often repeated , such principles are rarely observed in full measure . Even the word " voluntary " may be deemed some [ p510 ] what misleading , especially when one considers many of the confessions that have been brought under its umbrella . See , e.g. , supra , n. 5 . The tendency to overstate may be laid in part to the flagrant facts often before the Court ; but , in any event , one must recognize how it has tempered attitudes and lent some color of authority to the approach now taken by the Court .	unmatched
I turn now to the Court 's asserted reliance on the Fifth Amendment , an approach which I frankly regard as a tromp l'oeil . The Court 's opinion , in my view , reveals no adequate basis for extending the Fifth Amendment 's privilege against self - incrimination to the police station . Far more important , it fails to show that the Court 's new rules are well supported , let alone compelled , by Fifth Amendment precedents . Instead , the new rules actually derive from quotation and analogy drawn from precedents under the Sixth Amendment , which should properly have no bearing on police interrogation .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
The Court 's opening contention , that the Fifth Amendment governs police station confessions , is perhaps not an impermissible extension of the law but it has little to commend itself in the present circumstances . Historically , the privilege against self - incrimination did not bear at all on the use of extra - legal confessions , for which distinct standards evolved ; indeed ,	fifth_amendment
8 Wigmore , Evidence § 2266 , at 401 ( McNaughton rev.1961 ) . Practice under the two doctrines has also differed in a number of important respects . [ n6 ] [ p511 ] Even those who would readily enlarge the privilege must concede some linguistic difficulties , since the Fifth Amendment , in terms , proscribes only compelling any person " in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . " Cf . Kamisar , Equal Justice in the Gatehouses and Mansions of American Criminal Procedure , in Criminal Justice in Our Time 1 , 25 - 26 ( 1965 ) .	fifth_amendment
Though weighty , I do not say these points and similar ones are conclusive , for , as the Court reiterates , the privilege embodies basic principles always capable of expansion . [ n7 ] Certainly the privilege does represent a protective concern for the accused and an emphasis upon accusatorial , rather than inquisitorial , values in law enforcement , although this is similarly true of other limitations such as the grand jury requirement and the reasonable doubt standard . Accusatorial values , however , have openly been absorbed into the due process standard governing confessions ; this , indeed , is why , at present , " the kinship of the two rules [ governing confessions and self - incrimination ] is too apparent for denial . " McCormick , Evidence 155 ( 1954 ) . Since extension of the general principle has already occurred , to insist that the privilege applies as such serves only to carry over inapposite historical details and engaging rhetoric and to obscure the policy choices to be made in regulating confessions .	fifth_amendment
Having decided that the Fifth Amendment privilege does apply in the police station , the Court reveals that the privilege imposes more exacting restrictions than does the Fourteenth Amendment 's voluntariness test . [ n8 ] [ p512 ] It then emerges from a discussion of Escobedo that the Fifth Amendment requires , for an admissible confession , that it be given by one distinctly aware of his right not to speak and shielded from " the compelling atmosphere " of interrogation . See ante pp . 465 - 466 . From these key premises , the Court finally develops the safeguards of warning , counsel , and so forth . I do not believe these premises are sustained by precedents under the Fifth Amendment . [ n9 ]	fifth_amendment,amendmentxiv
The more important premise is that pressure on the suspect must be eliminated , though it be only the subtle influence of the atmosphere and surroundings . The Fifth Amendment , however , has never been thought to forbid all pressure to incriminate one 's self in the situations covered by it . On the contrary , it has been held that failure to incriminate one 's self can result in denial of removal of one 's case from state to federal court , Maryland v. Soper , 270 U.S. 9 ; in refusal of a military commission , Orloff v. Willoughby , 345 U.S. 83 ; in denial of a discharge in bankruptcy , Kaufman v. Hurwitz , 176 F.2d 210 , and in numerous other adverse consequences . See 8 Wigmore , Evidence § 2272 , at 441 - 444 , n. 18 ( McNaughton rev.1961 ) ; Maguire , Evidence of Guilt § 2.062 ( 1959 ) . This is not to say that , short of jail or torture , any sanction is permissible in any case ; policy and history alike may impose sharp limits . See , e.g. , [ p513 ] Griffin v. California , 380 U.S. 609 . However , the Court 's unspoken assumption that any pressure violates the privilege is not supported by the precedents , and it has failed to show why the Fifth Amendment prohibits that relatively mild pressure the Due Process Clause permits .	fifth_amendment,amendmentxiv
The Court appears similarly wrong in thinking that precise knowledge of one 's rights is a settled prerequisite under the Fifth Amendment to the loss of its protections . A number of lower federal court cases have held that grand jury witnesses need not always be warned of their privilege , e.g. , United States v. Scully , 225 F.2d 113 , 116 , and Wigmore states this to be the better rule for trial witnesses . See 8 Wigmore , Evidence § 2269 ( McNaughton rev.1961 ) . Cf . Henry v. Mississippi , 379 U.S. 443 , 451 - 452 ( waiver of constitutional rights by counsel despite defendant 's ignorance held allowable ) . No Fifth Amendment precedent is cited for the Court 's contrary view . There might , of course , be reasons apart from Fifth Amendment precedent for requiring warning or any other safeguard on questioning , but that is a different matter entirely . See infra pp . 516 - 517 .	fifth_amendment
A closing word must be said about the Assistance of Counsel Clause of the Sixth Amendment , which is never expressly relied on by the Court , but whose judicial precedents turn out to be linchpins of the confession rules announced today . To support its requirement of a knowing and intelligent waiver , the Court cites Johnson v. Zerbst , 304 U.S. 458 , ante p. 475 ; appointment of counsel for the indigent suspect is tied to Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U.S. 335 , and Douglas v. California , 372 U.S. 353 , ante p. 473 ; the silent - record doctrine is borrowed from Carnley v. Cochran , 369 U.S. 506 , ante p. 475 , as is the right to an express offer of counsel , ante p. 471 . All these cases imparting glosses to the Sixth Amendment concerned counsel at trial or on appeal . While the Court finds no pertinent difference between judicial proceedings and police interrogation , I believe [ p514 ] the differences are so vast as to disqualify wholly the Sixth Amendment precedents as suitable analogies in the present cases . [ n10 ]	sixth_amendment
The only attempt in this Court to carry the right to counsel into the stationhouse occurred in Escobedo , the Court repeating several times that that stage was no less " critical " than trial itself . See 378 U.S. 485 - 488 . This is hardly persuasive when we consider that a grand jury inquiry , the filing of a certiorari petition , and certainly the purchase of narcotics by an undercover agent from a prospective defendant may all be equally " critical , " yet provision of counsel and advice on that score have never been thought compelled by the Constitution in such cases . The sound reason why this right is so freely extended for a criminal trial is the severe injustice risked by confronting an untrained defendant with a range of technical points of law , evidence , and tactics familiar to the prosecutor , but not to himself . This danger shrinks markedly in the police station , where , indeed , the lawyer , in fulfilling his professional responsibilities , of necessity may become an obstacle to truthfinding . See infra , n. 12 . The Court 's summary citation of the Sixth Amendment cases here seems to me best described as	sixth_amendment
Friendly , supra , n. 10 , at 950 .	unmatched
Examined as an expression of public policy , the Court 's new regime proves so dubious that there can be no due [ p515 ] compensation for its weakness in constitutional law . The foregoing discussion has shown , I think , how mistaken is the Court in implying that the Constitution has struck the balance in favor of the approach the Court takes . Ante , p. 479 . Rather , precedent reveals that the Fourteenth Amendment , in practice , has been construed to strike a different balance , that the Fifth Amendment gives the Court little solid support in this context , and that the Sixth Amendment should have no bearing at all . Legal history has been stretched before to satisfy deep needs of society . In this instance , however , the Court has not and can not make the powerful showing that its new rules are plainly desirable in the context of our society , something which is surely demanded before those rules are engrafted onto the Constitution and imposed on every State and county in the land .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment,amendmentxiv
Without at all subscribing to the generally black picture of police conduct painted by the Court , I think it must be frankly recognized at the outset that police questioning allowable under due process precedents may inherently entail some pressure on the suspect , and may seek advantage in his ignorance or weaknesses . The atmosphere and questioning techniques , proper and fair though they be , can , in themselves , exert a tug on the suspect to confess , and , in this light ,	unmatched
Ashcraft v. Tennessee , 322 U.S. 143 , 161 ( Jackson , J. , dissenting ) . Until today , the role of the Constitution has been only to sift out undue pressure , not to assure spontaneous confessions . [ n11 ] [ p516 ]	unmatched
The Court 's new rules aim to offset these minor pressures and disadvantages intrinsic to any kind of police interrogation . The rules do not serve due process interests in preventing blatant coercion , since , as I noted earlier , they do nothing to contain the policeman who is prepared to lie from the start . The rules work for reliability in confessions almost only in the Pickwickian sense that they can prevent some from being given at all . [ n12 ] In short , the benefit of this new regime is simply to lessen or wipe out the inherent compulsion and inequalities to which the Court devotes some nine pages of description . Ante , pp . 448 - 456 .	unmatched
What the Court largely ignores is that its rules impair , if they will not eventually serve wholly to frustrate , an instrument of law enforcement that has long and quite reasonably been thought worth the price paid for it . [ n13 ] There can be little doubt that the Court 's new code would markedly decrease the number of confessions . To warn the suspect that he may remain silent and remind him that his confession may be used in court are minor obstructions . To require also an express waiver by the suspect and an end to questioning whenever he demurs [ p517 ] must heavily handicap questioning . And to suggest or provide counsel for the suspect simply invites the end of the interrogation . See supra , n. 12 .	unmatched
How much harm this decision will inflict on law enforcement can not fairly be predicted with accuracy . Evidence on the role of confessions is notoriously incomplete , see Developments , supra , n. 2 , at 941 - 944 , and little is added by the Court 's reference to the FBI experience and the resources believed wasted in interrogation . See infra , n.19 , and text . We do know that some crimes can not be solved without confessions , that ample expert testimony attests to their importance in crime control , [ n14 ] and that the Court is taking a real risk with society 's welfare in imposing its new regime on the country . The social costs of crime are too great to call the new rules anything but a hazardous experimentation .	unmatched
While passing over the costs and risks of its experiment , the Court portrays the evils of normal police questioning in terms which I think are exaggerated . Albeit stringently confined by the due process standards , interrogation is no doubt often inconvenient and unpleasant for the suspect . However , it is no less so for a man to be arrested and jailed , to have his house searched , or to stand trial in court , yet all this may properly happen to the most innocent , given probable cause , a warrant , or an indictment . Society has always paid a stiff price for law and order , and peaceful interrogation is not one of the dark moments of the law .	amendmentxiv
This brief statement of the competing considerations seems to me ample proof that the Court 's preference is highly debatable , at best , and therefore not to be read into [ p518 ] the Constitution . However , it may make the analysis more graphic to consider the actual facts of one of the four cases reversed by the Court . Miranda v. Arizona serves best , being neither the hardest nor easiest of the four under the Court 's standards . [ n15 ]	unmatched
On March 3 , 1963 , an 18-year - old girl was kidnapped and forcibly raped near Phoenix , Arizona . Ten days later , on the morning of March 13 , petitioner Miranda was arrested and taken to the police station . At this time , Miranda was 23 years old , indigent , and educated to the extent of completing half the ninth grade . He had " an emotional illness " of the schizophrenic type , according to the doctor who eventually examined him ; the doctor 's report also stated that Miranda was " alert and oriented as to time , place , and person , " intelligent within normal limits , competent to stand trial , and sane within the legal definition . At the police station , the victim picked Miranda out of a lineup , and two officers then took him into a separate room to interrogate him , starting about 11:30 a.m. Though at first denying his guilt , within a short time , Miranda gave a detailed oral confession , and then wrote out in his own hand and signed a brief statement admitting and describing the crime . All this was accomplished in two hours or less , without any force , threats or promises , and -- I will assume this , though the record is uncertain , ante 491 - 492 and nn 66 - 67 -- without any effective warnings at all .	unmatched
Miranda 's oral and written confessions are now held inadmissible under the Court 's new rules . One is entitled to feel astonished that the Constitution can be read to produce this result . These confessions were obtained [ p519 ] during brief daytime questioning conducted by two officers and unmarked by any of the traditional indicia of coercion . They assured a conviction for a brutal and unsettling crime , for which the police had and quite possibly could obtain little evidence other than the victim 's identifications , evidence which is frequently unreliable . There was , in sum , a legitimate purpose , no perceptible unfairness , and certainly little risk of injustice in the interrogation . Yet the resulting confessions , and the responsible course of police practice they represent , are to be sacrificed to the Court 's own finespun conception of fairness , which I seriously doubt is shared by many thinking citizens in this country . [ n16 ]	unmatched
The tenor of judicial opinion also falls well short of supporting the Court 's new approach . Although Escobedo has widely been interpreted as an open invitation to lower courts to rewrite the law of confessions , a significant heavy majority of the state and federal decisions in point have sought quite narrow interpretations . [ n17 ] Of [ p520 ] the courts that have accepted the invitation , it is hard to know how many have felt compelled by their best guess as to this Court 's likely construction ; but none of the state decisions saw fit to rely on the state privilege against self - incrimination , and no decision at all has gone as far as this Court goes today . [ n18 ]	fifth_amendment
It is also instructive to compare the attitude in this case of those responsible for law enforcement with the official views that existed when the Court undertook three major revisions of prosecutorial practice prior to this case , Johnson v. Zerbst , 304 U.S. 458 , Mapp v. Ohio , 367 U.S. 643 , and Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U.S. 335 . In Johnson , which established that appointed counsel must be offered the indigent in federal criminal trials , the Federal Government all but conceded the basic issue , which had , in fact , been recently fixed as Department of Justice policy . See Beaney , Right to Counsel 29 - 30 , 342 ( 1955 ) . In Mapp , which imposed the exclusionary rule on the States for Fourth Amendment violations , more than half of the States had themselves already adopted some such rule . See 367 U.S. at 651 . In Gideon , which extended Johnson v. Zerbst to the States , an amicus brief was filed by 22 States and Commonwealths urging that course ; only two States besides that of the respondent came forward to protest . See 372 U.S. at 345 . By contrast , in this case , new restrictions on police [ p521 ] questioning have been opposed by the United States and in an amicus brief signed by 27 States and Commonwealths , not including the three other States which are parties . No State in the country has urged this Court to impose the newly announced rules , nor has any State chosen to go nearly so far on its own .	sixth_amendment,fourth_amendment
The Court , in closing its general discussion , invokes the practice in federal and foreign jurisdictions as lending weight to its new curbs on confessions for all the States . A brief resume will suffice to show that none of these jurisdictions has struck so one - sided a balance as the Court does today . Heaviest reliance is placed on the FBI practice . Differing circumstances may make this comparison quite untrustworthy , [ n19 ] but , in any event , the FBI falls sensibly short of the Court 's formalistic rules . For example , there is no indication that FBI agents must obtain an affirmative " waiver " before they pursue their questioning . Nor is it clear that one invoking his right to silence may not be prevailed upon to change his mind . And the warning as to appointed counsel apparently indicates only that one will be assigned by the judge when the suspect appears before him ; the thrust of the Court 's rules is to induce the suspect to obtain appointed counsel before continuing the interview . See ante pp . 484 - 486 . Apparently , American military practice , briefly mentioned by the Court , has these same limits , and is still less favorable to the suspect than the FBI warning , making no mention of appointed counsel . Developments , supra , n. 2 , at 1084 - 1089 .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
The law of the foreign countries described by the Court also reflects a more moderate conception of the rights of [ p522 ] the accused as against those of society when other data are considered . Concededly , the English experience is most relevant . In that country , a caution as to silence , but not counsel , has long been mandated by the " Judges ' Rules , " which also place other somewhat imprecise limits on police cross - examination of suspects . However , in the court 's discretion , confessions can be , and apparently quite frequently are , admitted in evidence despite disregard of the Judges ' Rules , so long as they are found voluntary under the common law test . Moreover , the check that exists on the use of pretrial statements is counterbalanced by the evident admissibility of fruits of an illegal confession and by the judge 's often - used authority to comment adversely on the defendant 's failure to testify . [ n20 ] India , Ceylon and Scotland are the other examples chosen by the Court . In India and Ceylon , the general ban on police - adduced confessions cited by the Court is subject to a major exception : if evidence is uncovered by police questioning , it is fully admissible at trial along with the confession itself , so far as it relates to the evidence and is not blatantly coerced . See Developments , supra , n. 2 , at 1106 - 1110 ; Reg . v. Ramasamy [ 1965 ] A.C. 1 ( P.C. ) . Scotland 's limits on interrogation do measure up to the Court 's ; however , restrained comment at trial on the defendant 's failure to take the stand is allowed the judge , and , in many other respects , Scotch law redresses the prosecutor 's disadvantage in ways not permitted in this country . [ n21 ] The Court ends its survey by imputing [ p523 ] added strength to our privilege against self - incrimination since , by contrast to other countries , it is embodied in a written Constitution . Considering the liberties the Court has today taken with constitutional history and precedent , few will find this emphasis persuasive .	fifth_amendment
In closing this necessarily truncated discussion of policy considerations attending the new confession rules , some reference must be made to their ironic untimeliness . There is now in progress in this country a massive reexamination of criminal law enforcement procedures on a scale never before witnessed . Participants in this undertaking include a Special Committee of the American Bar Association , under the chairmanship of Chief Judge Lumbard of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ; a distinguished study group of the American Law Institute , headed by Professors Vorenberg and Bator of the Harvard Law School , and the President 's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice , under the leadership of the Attorney General of the United States . [ n22 ] Studies are also being conducted by the District of Columbia Crime Commission , the Georgetown Law Center , and by others equipped to do practical research . [ n23 ] There are also signs that legislatures in some of the States may be preparing to reexamine the problem before us . [ n24 ] [ p524 ]	unmatched
It is no secret that concern has been expressed lest long - range and lasting reforms be frustrated by this Court 's too rapid departure from existing constitutional standards . Despite the Court 's disclaimer , the practical effect of the decision made today must inevitably be to handicap seriously sound efforts at reform , not least by removing options necessary to a just compromise of competing interests . Of course , legislative reform is rarely speedy or unanimous , though this Court has been more patient in the past . [ n25 ] But the legislative reforms , when they come , would have the vast advantage of empirical data and comprehensive study , they would allow experimentation and use of solutions not open to the courts , and they would restore the initiative in criminal law reform to those forums where it truly belongs .	unmatched
All four of the cases involved here present express claims that confessions were inadmissible not because of coercion in the traditional due process sense , but solely because of lack of counsel or lack of warnings concerning counsel and silence . For the reasons stated in this opinion , I would adhere to the due process test and reject the new requirements inaugurated by the Court . On this premise , my disposition of each of these cases can be stated briefly .	amendmentxiv
In two of the three cases coming from state courts , Miranda v. Arizona ( No . 759 ) and Vignera v. New York ( No . 760 ) , the confessions were held admissible , and no other errors worth comment are alleged by petitioners . [ p525 ] I would affirm in these two cases . The other state case is California v. Stewart ( No . 584 ) , where the state supreme court held the confession inadmissible , and reversed the conviction . In that case , I would dismiss the writ of certiorari on the ground that no final judgment is before us , 28 U.S.C. 1257 ( 1964 ed . ) ; putting aside the new trial open to the State in any event , the confession itself has not even been finally excluded , since the California Supreme Court left the State free to show proof of a waiver . If the merits of the decision in Stewart be reached , then I believe it should be reversed , and the case remanded so the state supreme court may pass on the other claims available to respondent .	unmatched
In the federal case , Westover v. United States ( No . 761 ) , a number of issues are raised by petitioner apart from the one already dealt with in this dissent . None of these other claims appears to me tenable , nor in this context to warrant extended discussion . It is urged that the confession was also inadmissible because not voluntary , even measured by due process standards , and because federal - state cooperation brought the McNabb - Mallory rule into play under Anderson v. United States , 318 U.S. 350 . However , the facts alleged fall well short of coercion , in my view , and I believe the involvement of federal agents in petitioner 's arrest and detention by the State too slight to invoke Anderson . I agree with the Government that the admission of the evidence now protested by petitioner was , at most , harmless error , and two final contentions -- one involving weight of the evidence and another improper prosecutor comment -- seem to me without merit . I would therefore affirm Westover 's conviction .	amendmentxiv
In conclusion : nothing in the letter or the spirit of the Constitution or in the precedents squares with the heavy - handed and one - sided action that is so precipitously [ p526 ] taken by the Court in the name of fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities .

The proposition that the privilege against self - incrimination forbids in - custody interrogation without the warnings specified in the majority opinion and without a clear waiver of counsel has no significant support in the history of the privilege or in the language of the Fifth Amendment . As for the English authorities and the common law history , the privilege , firmly established in the second half of the seventeenth century , was never applied except to prohibit compelled judicial interrogations .

A few years later , the Fifth Amendment privilege was similarly extended to encompass the then well established rule against coerced confessions :	fifth_amendment
Bram v. United States , 168 U.S. 532 , 542 . Although this view has found approval in other cases , Burdeau v. McDowell , 256 U.S. 465 , 475 ; Powers v. United States , 223 U.S. 303 , 313 ; Shotwell v. United States , 371 U.S. 341 , 347 , it has also been questioned , see Brown v. Mississippi , 297 U.S. 278 , 285 ; United States v. Carignan , [ p528 ] 342 U.S. 36 , 41 ; Stein v. New York , 346 U.S. 156 , 191 , n. 35 , and finds scant support in either the English or American authorities , see generally Regina v. Scott , Dears . & Bell 47 ; 3 Wigmore , Evidence § 823 ( 3d ed.1940 ) , at 249 ( " a confession is not rejected because of any connection with the privilege against self - crimination " ) , and 250 , n. 5 ( particularly criticizing Bram ) ; 8 Wigmore , Evidence § 2266 , at 400 - 401 ( McNaughton rev.1961 ) . Whatever the source of the rule excluding coerced confessions , it is clear that , prior to the application of the privilege itself to state courts , Malloy v. Hogan , 378 U.S. 1 , the admissibility of a confession in a state criminal prosecution was tested by the same standards as were applied in federal prosecutions . Id. at 6 - 7 , 10 .	fifth_amendment
Bram , however , itself rejected the proposition which the Court now espouses . The question in Bram was whether a confession , obtained during custodial interrogation , had been compelled , and , if such interrogation was to be deemed inherently vulnerable , the Court 's inquiry could have ended there . After examining the English and American authorities , however , the Court declared that :	unmatched
168 U.S. at 558 . In this respect , the Court was wholly consistent with prior and subsequent pronouncements in this Court .	unmatched
Thus , prior to Bram , the Court , in Hopt v. Utah , 110 U.S. 574 , 583 - 587 , had upheld the admissibility of a [ p529 ] confession made to police officers following arrest , the record being silent concerning what conversation had occurred between the officers and the defendant in the short period preceding the confession . Relying on Hopt , the Court ruled squarely on the issue in Sparf and Hansen v. United States , 156 U.S. 51 , 55 :	unmatched

And in Wilson v. United States , 162 U.S. 613 , 623 , the Court had considered the significance of custodial interrogation without any antecedent warnings regarding the right to remain silent or the right to counsel . There , the defendant had answered questions posed by a Commissioner , who had failed to advise him of his rights , and his answers were held admissible over his claim of involuntariness .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
Since Bram , the admissibility of statements made during custodial interrogation has been frequently reiterated . Powers v. United States , 223 U.S. 303 , cited Wilson approvingly and held admissible as voluntary statements the accused 's testimony at a preliminary hearing even though he was not warned that what he said might be used against him . Without any discussion of the presence or absence of warnings , presumably because such discussion was deemed unnecessary , numerous other cases have declared that " [ t]he mere fact that a confession was made while in the custody of the police does not render it inadmissible , " McNabb v. United States , 318 U.S. 332 , 346 ; accord , United States v. Mitchell , 322 U.S. 65 , despite its having been elicited by police examination , Wan v. United States , 266 U.S. 1 , 14 ; United States v. Carignan , 342 U.S. 36 , 39 . Likewise , in Crooker v. California , 357 U.S. 433 , 437 , the Court said that	unmatched
And finally , in Cicenia v. Lagay , 357 U.S. 504 , a confession obtained by police interrogation after arrest was held voluntary even though the authorities refused to permit the defendant to consult with his attorney . See generally Culombe v. Connecticut , 367 U.S. 568 , 587 - 602 ( opinion of Frankfurter , J. ) ; 3 Wigmore , Evidence § 851 , at 313 ( 3d ed.1940 ) ; see also Joy , Admissibility of Confessions 38 , 46 ( 1842 ) .	unmatched
Only a tiny minority of our judges who have dealt with the question , including today 's majority , have considered in - custody interrogation , without more , to be a violation of the Fifth Amendment . And this Court , as [ p531 ] every member knows , has left standing literally thousands of criminal convictions that rested at least in part on confessions taken in the course of interrogation by the police after arrest .	fifth_amendment
That the Court 's holding today is neither compelled nor even strongly suggested by the language of the Fifth Amendment , is at odds with American and English legal history , and involves a departure from a long line of precedent does not prove either that the Court has exceeded its powers or that the Court is wrong or unwise in its present reinterpretation of the Fifth Amendment . It does , however , underscore the obvious -- that the Court has not discovered or found the law in making today 's decision , nor has it derived it from some irrefutable sources ; what it has done is to make new law and new public policy in much the same way that it has in the course of interpreting other great clauses of the Constitution . [ n1 ] This is what the Court historically has done . Indeed , it is what it must do , and will continue to do until and unless there is some fundamental change in the constitutional distribution of governmental powers .	fifth_amendment
But if the Court is here and now to announce new and fundamental policy to govern certain aspects of our affairs , it is wholly legitimate to examine the mode of this or any other constitutional decision in this Court , and to inquire into the advisability of its end product in terms of the long - range interest of the country . At the very least , the Court 's text and reasoning should withstand analysis , and be a fair exposition of the constitutional provision which its opinion interprets . Decisions [ p532 ] like these can not rest alone on syllogism , metaphysics or some ill - defined notions of natural justice , although each will perhaps play its part . In proceeding to such constructions as it now announces , the Court should also duly consider all the factors and interests bearing upon the cases , at least insofar as the relevant materials are available , and , if the necessary considerations are not treated in the record or obtainable from some other reliable source , the Court should not proceed to formulate fundamental policies based on speculation alone .	unmatched
First , we may inquire what are the textual and factual bases of this new fundamental rule . To reach the result announced on the grounds it does , the Court must stay within the confines of the Fifth Amendment , which forbids self - incrimination only if compelled . Hence , the core of the Court 's opinion is that , because of the	fifth_amendment
ante at 458 , absent the use of adequate protective devices as described by the Court . However , the Court does not point to any sudden inrush of new knowledge requiring the rejection of 70 years ' experience . Nor does it assert that its novel conclusion reflects a changing consensus among state courts , see Mapp v. Ohio , 367 U.S. 643 , or that a succession of cases had steadily eroded the old rule and proved it unworkable , see Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U.S. 335 . Rather than asserting new knowledge , the Court concedes that it can not truly know what occurs during custodial questioning , because of the innate secrecy of such proceedings . It extrapolates a picture of what it conceives to be the norm from police investigatorial manuals , published in 1959 and 1962 or earlier , without any attempt to allow for adjustments in police practices that may [ p533 ] have occurred in the wake of more recent decisions of state appellate tribunals or this Court . But even if the relentless application of the described procedures could lead to involuntary confessions , it most assuredly does not follow that each and every case will disclose this kind of interrogation or this kind of consequence . [ n2 ] Insofar as appears from the Court 's opinion , it has not examined a single transcript of any police interrogation , let alone the interrogation that took place in any one of these cases which it decides today . Judged by any of the standards for empirical investigation utilized in the social sciences , the factual basis for the Court 's premise is patently inadequate .	unmatched
Although , in the Court 's view , in - custody interrogation is inherently coercive , the Court says that the spontaneous product of the coercion of arrest and detention is still to be deemed voluntary . An accused , arrested on probable cause , may blurt out a confession which will be admissible despite the fact that he is alone and in custody , without any showing that he had any notion of his right to remain silent or of the consequences of his admission . Yet , under the Court 's rule , if the police ask him a single question , such as " Do you have anything to say ? " or " Did you kill your wife ? " , his response , if there is one , has somehow been compelled , even if the accused has [ p534 ] been clearly warned of his right to remain silent . Common sense informs us to the contrary . While one may say that the response was " involuntary " in the sense the question provoked or was the occasion for the response , and thus the defendant was induced to speak out when he might have remained silent if not arrested and not questioned , it is patently unsound to say the response is compelled .	fifth_amendment
Today 's result would not follow even if it were agreed that , to some extent , custodial interrogation is inherently coercive . See Ashcraft v. Tennessee , 322 U.S. 143 , 161 ( Jackson , J. , dissenting ) . The test has been whether the totality of circumstances deprived the defendant of a " free choice to admit , to deny , or to refuse to answer , " Lisenba v. California , 314 U.S. 219 , 241 , and whether physical or psychological coercion was of such a degree that " the defendant 's will was overborne at the time he confessed , " Haynes v. Washington , 373 U.S. 503 , 513 ; Lynumn v. Illinois , 372 U.S. 528 , 534 . The duration and nature of incommunicado custody , the presence or absence of advice concerning the defendant 's constitutional rights , and the granting or refusal of requests to communicate with lawyers , relatives or friends have all been rightly regarded as important data bearing on the basic inquiry . See , e.g. , Ashcraft v. Tennessee , 322 U.S. 143 ; Haynes v. Washington , 373 U.S. 503 . [ n3 ] [ p535 ] But it has never been suggested , until today , that such questioning was so coercive and accused persons so lacking in hardihood that the very first response to the very first question following the commencement of custody must be conclusively presumed to be the product of an overborne will .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
If the rule announced today were truly based on a conclusion that all confessions resulting from custodial interrogation are coerced , then it would simply have no rational foundation . Compare Tot v. United States , 319 U.S. 463 , 466 ; United States v. Romano , 382 U.S. 136 . A fortiori , that would be true of the extension of the rule to exculpatory statements , which the Court effects after a brief discussion of why , in the Court 's view , they must be deemed incriminatory , but without any discussion of why they must be deemed coerced . See Wilson v. United States , 162 U.S. 613 , 624 . Even if one were to postulate that the Court 's concern is not that all confessions induced by police interrogation are coerced , but rather that some such confessions are coerced and present judicial procedures are believed to be inadequate to identify the confessions that are coerced and those that are not , it would still not be essential to impose the rule that the Court has now fashioned . Transcripts or observers could be required , specific time limits , tailored to fit the cause , could be imposed , or other devices could be utilized to reduce the chances that otherwise indiscernible coercion will produce an inadmissible confession .	unmatched
On the other hand , even if one assumed that there was an adequate factual basis for the conclusion that all confessions obtained during in - custody interrogation are the product of compulsion , the rule propounded by [ p536 ] the Court would still be irrational , for , apparently , it is only if the accused is also warned of his right to counsel and waives both that right and the right against self - incrimination that the inherent compulsiveness of interrogation disappears . But if the defendant may not answer without a warning a question such as " Where were you last night ? " without having his answer be a compelled one , how can the Court ever accept his negative answer to the question of whether he wants to consult his retained counsel or counsel whom the court will appoint ? And why , if counsel is present and the accused nevertheless confesses , or counsel tells the accused to tell the truth and that is what the accused does , is the situation any less coercive insofar as the accused is concerned ? The Court apparently realizes its dilemma of foreclosing questioning without the necessary warnings but , at the same time , permitting the accused , sitting in the same chair in front of the same policemen , to waive his right to consult an attorney . It expects , however , that the accused will not often waive the right , and , if it is claimed that he has , the State faces a severe , if not impossible burden of proof .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
All of this makes very little sense in terms of the compulsion which the Fifth Amendment proscribes . That amendment deals with compelling the accused himself . It is his free will that is involved . Confessions and incriminating admissions , as such , are not forbidden evidence ; only those which are compelled are banned . I doubt that the Court observes these distinctions today . By considering any answers to any interrogation to be compelled regardless of the content and course of examination , and by escalating the requirements to prove waiver , the Court not only prevents the use of compelled confessions , but , for all practical purposes , forbids interrogation except in the presence of counsel . That is , instead of confining itself to protection of the right against compelled [ p537 ] self - incrimination the Court has created a limited Fifth Amendment right to counsel -- or , as the Court expresses it , a " need for counsel to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege . . . . " Ante at 470 . The focus then is not on the will of the accused , but on the will of counsel , and how much influence he can have on the accused . Obviously there is no warrant in the Fifth Amendment for thus installing counsel as the arbiter of the privilege .	fifth_amendment
In sum , for all the Court 's expounding on the menacing atmosphere of police interrogation procedures , it has failed to supply any foundation for the conclusions it draws or the measures it adopts .	unmatched
Criticism of the Court 's opinion , however , can not stop with a demonstration that the factual and textual bases for the rule it propounds are , at best , less than compelling . Equally relevant is an assessment of the rule 's consequences measured against community values . The Court 's duty to assess the consequences of its action is not satisfied by the utterance of the truth that a value of our system of criminal justice is " to respect the inviolability of the human personality " and to require government to produce the evidence against the accused by its own independent labors . Ante at 460 . More than the human dignity of the accused is involved ; the human personality of others in the society must also be preserved . Thus , the values reflected by the privilege are not the sole desideratum ; society 's interest in the general security is of equal weight .	fifth_amendment
The obvious underpinning of the Court 's decision is a deep - seated distrust of all confessions . As the Court declares that the accused may not be interrogated without counsel present , absent a waiver of the right to counsel , and as the Court all but admonishes the lawyer to [ p538 ] advise the accused to remain silent , the result adds up to a judicial judgment that evidence from the accused should not be used against him in any way , whether compelled or not . This is the not so subtle overtone of the opinion -- that it is inherently wrong for the police to gather evidence from the accused himself . And this is precisely the nub of this dissent . I see nothing wrong or immoral , and certainly nothing unconstitutional , in the police 's asking a suspect whom they have reasonable cause to arrest whether or not he killed his wife , or in confronting him with the evidence on which the arrest was based , at least where he has been plainly advised that he may remain completely silent , see Escobedo v. Illinois , 378 U.S. 478 , 499 ( dissenting opinion ) . Until today , " the admissions or confessions of the prisoner , when voluntarily and freely made , have always ranked high in the scale of incriminating evidence . " Brown v. Walker , 161 U.S. 591 , 596 ; see also Hopt v. Utah , 110 U.S. 574 , 584 - 585 . Particularly when corroborated , as where the police have confirmed the accused 's disclosure of the hiding place of implements or fruits of the crime , such confessions have the highest reliability , and significantly contribute to the certitude with which we may believe the accused is guilty . Moreover , it is by no means certain that the process of confessing is injurious to the accused . To the contrary , it may provide psychological relief , and enhance the prospects for rehabilitation . This is not to say that the value of respect for the inviolability of the accused 's individual personality should be accorded no weight , or that all confessions should be indiscriminately admitted . This Court has long read the Constitution to proscribe compelled confessions , a salutary rule from which there should be no retreat . But I see no sound basis , factual or otherwise , and the Court gives none , for concluding that the present rule against the receipt of coerced confessions is inadequate for the [ p539 ] task of sorting out inadmissible evidence , and must be replaced by the per se rule which is now imposed . Even if the new concept can be said to have advantages of some sort over the present law , they are far outweighed by its likely undesirable impact on other very relevant and important interests .	unmatched
The most basic function of any government is to provide for the security of the individual and of his property . Lanzetta v. New Jersey , 306 U.S. 451 , 455 . These ends of society are served by the criminal laws which for the most part are aimed at the prevention of crime . Without the reasonably effective performance of the task of preventing private violence and retaliation , it is idle to talk about human dignity and civilized values .	unmatched
The modes by which the criminal laws serve the interest in general security are many . First , the murderer who has taken the life of another is removed from the streets , deprived of his liberty , and thereby prevented from repeating his offense . In view of the statistics on recidivism in this country , [ n4 ] and of the number of instances [ p540 ] in which apprehension occurs only after repeated offenses , no one can sensibly claim that this aspect of the criminal law does not prevent crime or contribute significantly to the personal security of the ordinary citizen .	unmatched
Secondly , the swift and sure apprehension of those who refuse to respect the personal security and dignity of their neighbor unquestionably has its impact on others who might be similarly tempted . That the criminal law is wholly or partly ineffective with a segment of the population or with many of those who have been apprehended and convicted is a very faulty basis for concluding that it is not effective with respect to the great bulk of our citizens , or for thinking that , without the criminal laws , [ p541 ] or in the absence of their enforcement , there would be no increase in crime . Arguments of this nature are not borne out by any kind of reliable evidence that I have seen to this date .	unmatched
Thirdly , the law concerns itself with those whom it has confined . The hope and aim of modern penology , fortunately , is as soon as possible to return the convict to society a better and more law - abiding man than when he left . Sometimes there is success , sometimes failure . But at least the effort is made , and it should be made to the very maximum extent of our present and future capabilities .	unmatched
The rule announced today will measurably weaken the ability of the criminal law to perform these tasks . It is a deliberate calculus to prevent interrogations , to reduce the incidence of confessions and pleas of guilty , and to increase the number of trials . [ n5 ] Criminal trials , no [ p542 ] matter how efficient the police are , are not sure bets for the prosecution , nor should they be if the evidence is not forthcoming . Under the present law , the prosecution fails to prove its case in about 30 % of the criminal cases actually tried in the federal courts . See Federal Offenders : 1964 , supra , note 4 , at 6 ( Table 4 ) , 59 ( Table 1 ) ; Federal Offenders : 1963 , supra , note 4 , at 5 ( Table 3 ) ; District of Columbia Offenders : 1963 , supra , note 4 , at 2 ( Table 1 ) . But it is something else again to remove from the ordinary criminal case all those confessions which heretofore have been held to be free and voluntary acts of the accused , and to thus establish a new constitutional barrier to the ascertainment of truth by the judicial process . There is , in my view , every reason to believe that a good many criminal defendants who otherwise would have been convicted on what this Court has previously thought to be the most satisfactory kind of evidence will now , under this new version of the Fifth Amendment , either not be tried at all or will be acquitted if the State 's evidence , minus the confession , is put to the test of litigation .	fifth_amendment
I have no desire whatsoever to share the responsibility for any such impact on the present criminal process .	unmatched
In some unknown number of cases , the Court 's rule will return a killer , a rapist or other criminal to the streets and to the environment which produced him , to repeat his crime whenever it pleases him . As a consequence , there will not be a gain , but a loss , in human dignity . The real concern is not the unfortunate consequences of this new decision on the criminal law as an abstract , disembodied series of authoritative proscriptions , but the impact on those who rely on the public authority for protection , and who , without it , can only engage in violent self - help with guns , knives and the help of their neighbors similarly inclined . There is , of [ p543 ] course , a saving factor : the next victims are uncertain , unnamed and unrepresented in this case .	unmatched
Nor can this decision do other than have a corrosive effect on the criminal law as an effective device to prevent crime . A major component in its effectiveness in this regard is its swift and sure enforcement . The easier it is to get away with rape and murder , the less the deterrent effect on those who are inclined to attempt it . This is still good common sense . If it were not , we should post - haste liquidate the whole law enforcement establishment as a useless , misguided effort to control human conduct .	unmatched
And what about the accused who has confessed or would confess in response to simple , noncoercive questioning and whose guilt could not otherwise be proved ? Is it so clear that release is the best thing for him in every case ? Has it so unquestionably been resolved that , in each and every case , it would be better for him not to confess , and to return to his environment with no attempt whatsoever to help him ? I think not . It may well be that , in many cases , it will be no less than a callous disregard for his own welfare , as well as for the interests of his next victim .	unmatched
There is another aspect to the effect of the Court 's rule on the person whom the police have arrested on probable cause . The fact is that he may not be guilty at all , and may be able to extricate himself quickly and simply if he were told the circumstances of his arrest and were asked to explain . This effort , and his release , must now await the hiring of a lawyer or his appointment by the court , consultation with counsel , and then a session with the police or the prosecutor . Similarly , where probable cause exists to arrest several suspects , as where the body of the victim is discovered in a house having several residents , compare Johnson v. State , 238 Md. 140 , 207 A.2d 643 ( 1965 ) , cert . denied , 382 U.S. 1013 , it will often [ p544 ] be true that a suspect may be cleared only through the results of interrogation of other suspects . Here too , the release of the innocent may be delayed by the Court 's rule .	unmatched
Much of the trouble with the Court 's new rule is that it will operate indiscriminately in all criminal cases , regardless of the severity of the crime or the circumstances involved . It applies to every defendant , whether the professional criminal or one committing a crime of momentary passion who is not part and parcel of organized crime . It will slow down the investigation and the apprehension of confederates in those cases where time is of the essence , such as kidnapping , see Brinegar v. United States , 338 U.S. 160 , 183 ( Jackson , J. , dissenting ) ; People v. Modesto , 62 Cal.2d 436 , 446 , 398 P.2d 753 , 759 ( 1965 ) , those involving the national security , see United States v. Drummond , 354 F.2d 132 , 147 ( C.A.2d Cir.1965 ) ( en banc ) ( espionage case ) , pet . for cert . pending , No . 1203 , Misc . , O.T. 1965 ; cf . Gessner v. United States , 354 F.2d 726 , 730 , n. 10 ( C.A. 10th Cir.1965 ) ( upholding , in espionage case , trial ruling that Government need not submit classified portions of interrogation transcript ) , and some of those involving organized crime . In the latter context , the lawyer who arrives may also be the lawyer for the defendant 's colleagues , and can be relied upon to insure that no breach of the organization 's security takes place even though the accused may feel that the best thing he can do is to cooperate .	unmatched
At the same time , the Court 's per se approach may not be justified on the ground that it provides a " bright line " permitting the authorities to judge in advance whether interrogation may safely be pursued without jeopardizing the admissibility of any information obtained as a consequence . Nor can it be claimed that judicial time and effort , assuming that is a relevant consideration , [ p545 ] will be conserved because of the ease of application of the new rule . Today 's decision leaves open such questions as whether the accused was in custody , whether his statements were spontaneous or the product of interrogation , whether the accused has effectively waived his rights , and whether nontestimonial evidence introduced at trial is the fruit of statements made during a prohibited interrogation , all of which are certain to prove productive of uncertainty during investigation and litigation during prosecution . For all these reasons , if further restrictions on police interrogation are desirable at this time , a more flexible approach makes much more sense than the Court 's constitutional straitjacket , which forecloses more discriminating treatment by legislative or rulemaking pronouncements .	unmatched
Applying the traditional standards to the cases before the Court , I would hold these confessions voluntary . I would therefore affirm in Nos . 759 , 760 , and 761 , and reverse in No . 584 .	unmatched
Of course , the Court does not deny that it is departing from prior precedent ; it expressly overrules Crooker and Cicenia , ante at 479 , n. 48 , and it acknowledges that , in the instant " cases , we might not find the defendants ' statements to have been involuntary in traditional terms , " ante at 457 .	unmatched
In fact , the type of sustained interrogation described by the Court appears to be the exception , rather than the rule . A survey of 399 cases in one city found that , in almost half of the cases , the interrogation lasted less than 30 minutes . Barrett , Police Practices and the Law -- From Arrest to Release or Charge , 50 Calif . L.Rev . 11 , 41 - 45 ( 1962 ) . Questioning tends to be confused and sporadic , and is usually concentrated on confrontations with witnesses or new items of evidence as these are obtained by officers conducting the investigation . See generally LaFave , Arrest : The Decision to Take a Suspect into Custody 386 ( 1965 ) ; ALI , A Model Code of Pre - Arraignment Procedure , Commentary § 5.01 , at 170 , n. 4 ( Tent . Draft No . 1 , 1966 ) .	unmatched
By contrast , the Court indicates that , in applying this new rule , it " will not pause to inquire in individual cases whether the defendant was aware of his rights without a warning being given . " Ante at 468 . The reason given is that assessment of the knowledge of the defendant based on information as to age , education , intelligence , or prior contact with authorities can never be more than speculation , while a warning is a clear - cut fact . But the officers ' claim that they gave the requisite warnings may be disputed , and facts respecting the defendant 's prior experience may be undisputed , and be of such a nature as to virtually preclude any doubt that the defendant knew of his rights . See United States v. Bolden , 355 F.2d 453 ( C.A. 7th Cir.1965 ) , petition for cert . pending , No . 1146 , O.T. 1965 ( Secret Service agent ) ; People v. Du Bont , 235 Cal . App.2d 844 , 45 Cal . Rptr . 717 , pet . for cert . pending No . 1053 , Misc . , O.T. 1965 ( former police officer ) .	unmatched
Precise statistics on the extent of recidivism are unavailable , in part because not all crimes are solved and in part because criminal records of convictions in different jurisdictions are not brought together by a central data collection agency . Beginning in 1963 , however , the Federal Bureau of Investigation began collating data on " Careers in Crime , " which it publishes in its Uniform Crime Reports . Of 92,869 offenders processed in 1963 and 1964 , 76 % had a prior arrest record on some charge . Over a period of 10 years , the group had accumulated 434,000 charges . FBI , Uniform Crime Reports -- 1964 , 27 - 28 . In 1963 and 1964 , between 23 % and 25 % of all offenders sentenced in 88 federal district courts ( excluding the District Court for the District of Columbia ) whose criminal records were reported had previously been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 13 months or more . Approximately an additional 40 % had a prior record less than prison ( juvenile record , probation record , etc . ) . Administrative Office of the United States Courts , Federal Offenders in the United States District Courts : 1964 , x , 36 ( hereinafter cited as Federal Offenders : 1964 ) ; Administrative Office of the United States Courts , Federal Offenders in the United States District Courts : 1963 , 25 - 27 ( hereinafter cited as Federal Offenders : 1963 ) . During the same two years in the District Court for the District of Columbia , between 28 % and 35 % of those sentenced had prior prison records , and from 37 % to 40 % had a prior record less than prison . Federal Offenders : 1964 , xii , 64 , 66 ; Administrative Office of the United States Courts , Federal Offenders in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia : 1963 , 8 , 10 ( hereinafter cited as District of Columbia Offenders : 1963 ) .	unmatched
A similar picture is obtained if one looks at the subsequent records of those released from confinement . In 1964 , 12.3 % of persons on federal probation had their probation revoked because of the commission of major violations ( defined as one in which the probationer has been committed to imprisonment for a period of 90 days or more , been placed on probation for over one year on a new offense , or has absconded with felony charges outstanding ) . Twenty - three and two - tenths percent of parolees and 16.9 % of those who had been mandatorily released after service of a portion of their sentence likewise committed major violations . Reports of the Proceedings of the Judicial Conference of the United States and Annual Report of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts : 1965 , 138 . See also Mandel et al . , Recidivism Studied and Defined , 56 J.Crim . L. , C. & P. S. 59 ( 1965 ) ( within five years of release , 62.33 % of sample had committed offenses placing them in recidivist category ) .	unmatched
Eighty - eight federal district courts ( excluding the District Court for the District of Columbia ) disposed of the cases of 33,381 criminal defendants in 1964 . Only 12.5 % of those cases were actually tried . Of the remaining cases , 89.9 % were terminated by convictions upon pleas of guilty and 10.1 % were dismissed . Stated differently , approximately 90 % of all convictions resulted from guilty pleas . Federal Offenders : 1964 , supra , note 4 , 3 - 6 . In the District Court for the District of Columbia , a higher percentage , 27 % , went to trial , and the defendant pleaded guilty in approximately 78 % of the cases terminated prior to trial . Id. at 58 - 59 . No reliable statistics are available concerning the percentage of cases in which guilty pleas are induced because of the existence of a confession or of physical evidence unearthed as a result of a confession . Undoubtedly the number of such cases is substantial .	unmatched

It is with regret that I find it necessary to write in these cases . However , I am unable to join the majority because its opinion goes too far on too little , while my dissenting brethren do not go quite far enough . Nor can I join in the Court 's criticism of the present practices of police and investigatory agencies as to custodial interrogation . The materials it refers to as " police manuals " [ n1 ] are , as I read them , merely writings in this field by professors and some police officers . Not one is shown by the record here to be the official manual of any police department , much less in universal use in crime detection . Moreover , the examples of police brutality mentioned by the Court [ n2 ] are rare exceptions to the thousands of cases [ p500 ] that appear every year in the law reports . The police agencies -- all the way from municipal and state forces to the federal bureaus -- are responsible for law enforcement and public safety in this country . I am proud of their efforts , which , in my view , are not fairly characterized by the Court 's opinion .	unmatched
The ipse dixit of the majority has no support in our cases . Indeed , the Court admits that " we might not find the defendants ' statements [ here ] to have been involuntary in traditional terms . " Ante , p. 457 . In short , the Court has added more to the requirements that the accused is entitled to consult with his lawyer and that he must be given the traditional warning that he may remain silent and that anything that he says may be used against him . Escobedo v. Illinois , 378 U.S. 478 , 490 - 491 ( 1964 ) . Now the Court fashions a constitutional rule that the police may engage in no custodial interrogation without additionally advising the accused that he has a right under the Fifth Amendment to the presence of counsel during interrogation and that , if he is without funds , counsel will be furnished him . When , at any point during an interrogation , the accused seeks affirmatively or impliedly to invoke his rights to silence or counsel , interrogation must be forgone or postponed . The Court further holds that failure to follow the new procedures requires inexorably the exclusion of any statement by the accused , as well as the fruits thereof . Such a strict constitutional specific inserted at the nerve center of crime detection may well kill the patient . [ n3 ] [ p501 ] Since there is at this time a paucity of information and an almost total lack of empirical knowledge on the practical operation of requirements truly comparable to those announced by the majority , I would be more restrained , lest we go too far too fast .	fifth_amendment
Custodial interrogation has long been recognized as " undoubtedly an essential tool in effective law enforcement . " Haynes v. Washington , 373 U.S. 503 , 515 ( 1963 ) . Recognition of this fact should put us on guard against the promulgation of doctrinaire rules . Especially is this true where the Court finds that " the Constitution has prescribed " its holding , and where the light of our past cases , from Hopt v. Utah , 110 U.S. 574 ( 1884 ) , down to Haynes v. Washington , supra , is to [ p502 ] the contrary . Indeed , even in Escobedo , the Court never hinted that an affirmative " waiver " was a prerequisite to questioning ; that the burden of proof as to waiver was on the prosecution ; that the presence of counsel -- absent a waiver -- during interrogation was required ; that a waiver can be withdrawn at the will of the accused ; that counsel must be furnished during an accusatory stage to those unable to pay ; nor that admissions and exculpatory statements are " confessions . " To require all those things at one gulp should cause the Court to choke over more cases than Crooker v. California , 357 U.S. 433 ( 1958 ) , and Cicenia v. Lagay , 357 U.S. 504 ( 1958 ) , which it expressly overrules today .	fifth_amendment,sixth_amendment
The rule prior to today -- as Mr. Justice Goldberg , the author of the Court 's opinion in Escobedo , stated it in Haynes v. Washington -- depended upon " a totality of circumstances evidencing an involuntary . . . admission of guilt . " 373 U.S. at 514 . And he concluded :	unmatched
Id. at 514 - 515 . [ p503 ]	unmatched
I would continue to follow that rule . Under the " totality of circumstances " rule of which my Brother Goldberg spoke in Haynes , I would consider in each case whether the police officer , prior to custodial interrogation , added the warning that the suspect might have counsel present at the interrogation , and , further , that a court would appoint one at his request if he was too poor to employ counsel . In the absence of warnings , the burden would be on the State to prove that counsel was knowingly and intelligently waived or that , in the totality of the circumstances , including the failure to give the necessary warnings , the confession was clearly voluntary .	unmatched
Rather than employing the arbitrary Fifth Amendment rule [ n4 ] which the Court lays down , I would follow the more pliable dictates of the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments which we are accustomed to administering , and which we know from our cases are effective instruments in protecting persons in police custody . In this way , we would not be acting in the dark , nor , in one full sweep , changing the traditional rules of custodial interrogation which this Court has for so long recognized as a justifiable and proper tool in balancing individual rights against the rights of society . It will be soon enough to go further when we are able to appraise with somewhat better accuracy the effect of such a holding .	fifth_amendment,amendmentxiv
I would affirm the convictions in Miranda v. Arizona , No . 759 ; Vignera v. New York , No . 760 , and Westover v. United States , No . 761 . In each of those cases , I find from the circumstances no warrant for reversal . In [ p504 ] California v. Stewart , No . 584 , I would dismiss the writ of certiorari for want of a final judgment , 28 U.S.C. § 1257(3 ) ( 1964 ed . ) ; but , if the merits are to be reached , I would affirm on the ground that the State failed to fulfill its burden , in the absence of a showing that appropriate warnings were given , of proving a waiver or a totality of circumstances showing voluntariness . Should there be a retrial , I would leave the State free to attempt to prove these elements .	unmatched

The Court points to England , Scotland , Ceylon and India as having equally rigid rules . As in Brother HARLAN points out , post , pp . 521 - 523 , the Court is mistaken in this regard , for it overlooks counterbalancing prosecutorial advantages . Moreover , the requirements of the Federal Bureau of Investigation do not appear from the Solicitor General 's letter , ante , pp . 484 - 486 , to be as strict as those imposed today in at least two respects : ( 1 ) The offer of counsel is articulated only as " a right to counsel " ; nothing is said about a right to have counsel present at the custodial interrogation . ( See also the examples cited by the Solicitor General , Westover v. United States , 342 F.2d 684 , 685 ( 1965 ) ( " right to consult counsel " ) ; Jackson v. United States , 337 F.2d 136 , 138 ( 1964 ) ( accused " entitled to an attorney " ) . ) Indeed , the practice is that , whenever the suspect	sixth_amendment
This clearly indicates that the FBI does not warn that counsel may be present during custodial interrogation . ( 2 ) The Solicitor General 's letter states :	sixth_amendment
So phrased , this warning does not indicate that the agent will secure counsel . Rather , the statement may well be interpreted by the suspect to mean that the burden is placed upon himself , and that he may have counsel appointed only when brought before the judge or at trial -- but not at custodial interrogation . As I view the FBI practice , it is not as broad as the one laid down today by the Court .	sixth_amendment
In my view , there is " no significant support " in our cases for the holding of the Court today that the Fifth Amendment privilege , in effect , forbids custodial interrogation . For a discussion of this point , see the dissenting opinion of my Brother WHITE , post pp . 526 - 531 .	fifth_amendment

In 2010 , Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in order to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care . One key provision is the individual mandate , which requires most Americans to maintain " minimum essential " health insurance coverage . 26 U. S. C. § 5000A. For individuals who are not exempt , and who do not receive health insurance through an employer or government program , the means of satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a private company . Beginning in 2014 , those who do not comply with the mandate must make a " [ s]hared responsibility payment " to the Federal Government . § 5000A(b)(1 ) . The Act provides that this " penalty " will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service with an individual 's taxes , and " shall be assessed and collected in the same manner " as tax penalties . § § 5000A(c ) , ( g)(1 ) .	unmatched
Another key provision of the Act is the Medicaid expansion . The current Medicaid program offers federal funding to States to assist pregnant women , children , needy families , the blind , the elderly , and the disabled in obtaining medical care . 42 U. S. C. § 1396d(a ) . The Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medicaid program and increases the number of individuals the States must cover . For example , the Act requires state programs to provide Medicaid coverage by 2014 to adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level , whereas many States now cover adults with children only if their income is considerably lower , and do not cover childless adults at all . § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII ) . The Act increases federal funding to cover the States' costs in expanding Medicaid coverage . § 1396d(y)(1 ) . But if a State does not comply with the Act 's new coverage requirements , it may lose not only the federal funding for those requirements , but all of its federal Medicaid funds . § 1396c .	unmatched

Today we resolve constitutional challenges to two provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 : the individual mandate , which requires individuals to purchase a health insurance policy providing a minimum level of coverage ; and the Medicaid expansion , which gives funds to the States on the condition that they provide specified health care to all citizens whose income falls below a certain threshold . We do not consider whether the Act embodies sound policies . That judgment is entrusted to the Nation 's elected leaders . We ask only whether Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact the challenged provisions .	unmatched
In our federal system , the National Government possesses only limited powers ; the States and the people retain the remainder . Nearly two centuries ago , Chief Justice Marshall observed that " the question respecting the extent of the powers actually granted " to the Federal Government " is perpetually arising , and will probably continue to arise , as long as our system shall exist . " McCulloch v. Maryland , 4 Wheat . 316 , 405 ( 1819 ) . In this case we must again determine whether the Constitution grants Congress powers it now asserts , but which many States and individuals believe it does not possess . Resolving this controversy requires us to examine both the limits of the Government 's power , and our own limited role in policing those boundaries .	unmatched

The Constitution 's express conferral of some powers makes clear that it does not grant others . And the Federal Government " can exercise only the powers granted to it . " McCulloch , supra , at 405 .	articlei#section8
Today , the restrictions on government power foremost in many Americans' minds are likely to be affirmative pro - hibitions , such as contained in the Bill of Rights . These affirmative prohibitions come into play , however , only where the Government possesses authority to act in the first place . If no enumerated power authorizes Congress to pass a certain law , that law may not be enacted , even if it would not violate any of the express prohibitions in the Bill of Rights or elsewhere in the Constitution .	unmatched
Indeed , the Constitution did not initially include a Bill of Rights at least partly because the Framers felt the enu - meration of powers sufficed to restrain the Government . As Alexander Hamilton put it , " the Constitution is itself , in every rational sense , and to every useful purpose , a bill of rights . " The Federalist No . 84 , p. 515 ( C. Ros - siter ed . 1961 ) . And when the Bill of Rights was ratified , it made express what the enumeration of powers necessarily implied : " The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution . . . are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . " U. S. Const . , Amdt . 10 . The Federal Government has expanded dramatically over the past two centuries , but it still must show that a constitutional grant of power authorizes each of its actions . See , e.g. , United States v. Comstock , 560 U. S. _ _ _ ( 2010 ) .	tenth_amendment
The same does not apply to the States , because the Con - stitution is not the source of their power . The Consti - tution may restrict state governments — as it does , for example , by forbidding them to deny any person the equal protection of the laws . But where such prohibitions donot apply , state governments do not need constitutional au - thorization to act . The States thus can and do perform many of the vital functions of modern government — punishing street crime , running public schools , and zoning property for development , to name but a few — even though the Constitution 's text does not authorize any government to do so . Our cases refer to this general power of governing , possessed by the States but not by the Federal Government , as the " police power . " See , e.g. , United States v. Morrison , 529 U. S. 598–619 ( 2000 ) .	amendmentxiv
" State sovereignty is not just an end in itself : Rather , federalism secures to citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign power . " New York v. United States , 505 U. S. 144 , 181 ( 1992 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . Because the police power is controlled by 50 different States instead of one national sovereign , the facets of governing that touch on citizens' daily lives are normally administered by smaller governments closer to the governed . The Framers thus ensured that powers which " in the ordinary course of affairs , concern the lives , liberties , and properties of the people " were held by governments more local and more accountable than a dis - tant federal bureaucracy . The Federalist No . 45 , at 293(J. Madison ) . The independent power of the States also serves as a check on the power of the Federal Government : " By denying any one government complete jurisdiction over all the concerns of public life , federalism protects the liberty of the individual from arbitrary power . " Bond v. United States , 564 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2011 ) ( slip op . , at 9–10 ) .	unmatched
This case concerns two powers that the Constitution does grant the Federal Government , but which must be read carefully to avoid creating a general federal authority akin to the police power . The Constitution authorizes Congress to " regulate Commerce with foreign Nations , and among the several States , and with the Indian Tribes . " Art . I , § 8 , cl . 3 . Our precedents read that to mean that Congress may regulate " the channels of interstate commerce , " " persons or things in interstate commerce , " and " those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce . " Morrison , supra , at 609 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . The power over activities that substantially affect interstate commerce can be expansive . That power has been held to authorize federal regulation of such seem - ingly local matters as a farmer 's decision to grow wheat for himself and his livestock , and a loan shark 's extor - tionate collections from a neighborhood butcher shop . See Wickard v. Filburn , 317 U. S. 111 ( 1942 ) ; Perez v. United States , 402 U. S. 146 ( 1971 ) .	articlei#section8
Congress may also " lay and collect Taxes , Duties , Imposts and Excises , to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States . " U. S. Const . , Art . I , § 8 , cl . 1 . Put simply , Congress may tax and spend . This grant gives the Federal Government considerable influence even in areas whereit can not directly regulate . The Federal Government may enact a tax on an activity that it can not authorize , forbid , or otherwise control . See , e.g. , License Tax Cases , 5 Wall . 462 , 471 ( 1867 ) . And in exercising its spending power , Congress may offer funds to the States , and may condition those offers on compliance with specified conditions . See , e.g. , College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed . Expense Bd . , 527 U. S. 666 , 686 ( 1999 ) . These offers may well induce the States to adopt policies thatthe Federal Government itself could not impose . See , e.g. , South Dakota v. Dole , 483 U. S. 203–206 ( 1987 ) ( conditioning federal highway funds on States raising their drinking age to 21 ) .	articlei#section8
The reach of the Federal Government 's enumerated powers is broader still because the Constitution authorizes Congress to " make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers . " Art . I , § 8 , cl . 18 . We have long read this provision to give Congress great latitude in exercising its powers : " Let the end be legitimate , let it be within the scope of the constitution , and all means which are appropriate , which are plainly adapted to that end , which are not prohibited , but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution , are constitutional . " McCulloch , 4 Wheat . , at 421 .	articlei#section8
Our permissive reading of these powers is explained in part by a general reticence to invalidate the acts of the Nation 's elected leaders . " Proper respect for a co - ordinate branch of the government " requires that we strike down an Act of Congress only if " the lack of constitutionalauthority to pass [ the ] act in question is clearly demonstrated . " United States v. Harris , 106 U. S. 629 , 635 ( 1883 ) . Members of this Court are vested with the authority to interpret the law ; we possess neither the expertise northe prerogative to make policy judgments . Those decisions are entrusted to our Nation 's elected leaders , who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them . It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices .	unmatched
Our deference in matters of policy can not , however , become abdication in matters of law . " The powers of the legislature are defined and limited ; and that those lim - its may not be mistaken , or forgotten , the constitution is written . " Marbury v. Madison , 1 Cranch 137 , 176 ( 1803 ) . Our respect for Congress 's policy judgments thus can never extend so far as to disavow restraints on federal power that the Constitution carefully constructed . " The peculiar circumstances of the moment may render a measure more or less wise , but can not render it more or less constitutional . " Chief Justice John Marshall , A Friend of the Constitution No . V , Alexandria Gazette , July 5 , 1819 , in John Marshall 's Defense of McCulloch v. Maryland 190–191 ( G. Gunther ed . 1969 ) . And there can be no question that it is the responsibility of this Court to enforce the limits on federal power by striking down acts of Congress that transgress those limits . Marbury v. Madison , supra , at 175–176 .	unmatched

In 2010 , Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , 124Stat . 119 . The Act aims to increase the number of Americans covered by health in - surance and decrease the cost of health care . The Act 's 10 titles stretch over 900 pages and contain hundreds of provisions . This case concerns constitutional challenges to two key provisions , commonly referred to as the individual mandate and the Medicaid expansion .	unmatched
The individual mandate requires most Americans to maintain " minimum essential " health insurance coverage . 26 U. S. C. § 5000A. The mandate does not apply to some individuals , such as prisoners and undocumented aliens . § 5000A(d ) . Many individuals will receive the required cov - erage through their employer , or from a government program such as Medicaid or Medicare . See § 5000A(f ) . But for individuals who are not exempt and do not receive health insurance through a third party , the means of satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a private company .	unmatched
Beginning in 2014 , those who do not comply with the mandate must make a " [ s]hared responsibility payment " to the Federal Government . § 5000A(b)(1 ) . That payment , which the Act describes as a " penalty , " is calculated as a percentage of household income , subject to a floor based on a specified dollar amount and a ceiling based on the average annual premium the individual would have to pay for qualifying private health insurance . § 5000A(c ) . In 2016 , for example , the penalty will be 2.5 percent of an individ - ual 's household income , but no less than $ 695 and no more than the average yearly premium for insurance that covers 60 percent of the cost of 10 specified services ( e.g. , prescription drugs and hospitalization ) . Ibid . ; 42 U. S. C. § 18022 . The Act provides that the penalty will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service with an individual 's taxes , and " shall be assessed and collected in the same manner " as tax penalties , such as the penalty for claiming toolarge an income tax refund . 26 U. S. C. § 5000A(g)(1 ) . The Act , however , bars the IRS from using several of its normal enforcement tools , such as criminal prosecutions and levies . § 5000A(g)(2 ) . And some individuals who are subject to the mandate are nonetheless exempt from the penalty — for example , those with income below a certain threshold and members of Indian tribes . § 5000A(e ) .	unmatched
On the day the President signed the Act into law , Florida and 12 other States filed a complaint in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Florida . Those plaintiffs — who are both respondents and petitioners here , depending on the issue — were subsequently joined by 13 more States , several individuals , and the National Fed - eration of Independent Business . The plaintiffs alleged , among other things , that the individual mandate provisions of the Act exceeded Congress 's powers under Article I of the Constitution . The District Court agreed , holding that Congress lacked constitutional power to enact the individual mandate . 780 F. Supp . 2d 1256 ( ND Fla. 2011 ) . The District Court determined that the individual mandate could not be severed from the remainder of the Act , and therefore struck down the Act in its entirety . Id. , at 1305–1306 .	unmatched
The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part . The court affirmed the District Court 's holding that the individual mandate exceeds Congress 's power . 648 F. 3d 1235 ( 2011 ) . The panel unanimously agreed that the individual mandate did not impose a tax , and thus could not be authorized by Congress 's power to " lay and collect Taxes . " U. S. Const . , Art . I , § 8 , cl . 1 . A majority also held that the individual mandate was not supported by Congress 's power to " regulate Commerce . . . among the several States . " Id. , cl . 3 . According to the majority , the Commerce Clause does not empower the Federal Government to order individuals to engage in commerce , and the Government 's efforts to cast the individual mandate in a different light were unpersuasive . Judge Marcus dissented , reasoning that the individual mandate regulates economic activity that has a clear effect on interstate commerce .	articlei#section8
Having held the individual mandate to be unconstitutional , the majority examined whether that provision could be severed from the remainder of the Act . The ma - jority determined that , contrary to the District Court 's view , it could . The court thus struck down only the individual mandate , leaving the Act 's other provisions intact . 648 F. 3d , at 1328 .	unmatched
Other Courts of Appeals have also heard challenges to the individual mandate . The Sixth Circuit and the D. C. Circuit upheld the mandate as a valid exercise of Congress 's commerce power . See Thomas More Law Center v. Obama , 651 F. 3d 529 ( CA6 2011 ) ; Seven - Sky v. Holder , 661 F. 3d 1 ( CADC 2011 ) . The Fourth Circuit determined that the Anti - Injunction Act prevents courts from considering the merits of that question . See Liberty Univ . , Inc. v. Geithner , 671 F. 3d 391 ( 2011 ) . That statute bars suits " for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax . " 26 U. S. C. § 7421(a ) . A majority of the Fourth Circuit panel reasoned that the individual mandate 's penalty is a tax within the meaning of the Anti - Injunction Act , because it is a financial assessment collected by the IRS through the normal means of taxation . The majority therefore determined that the plaintiffs could not challenge the individual mandate until after they paid the penalty . 1	articlei#section8
The second provision of the Affordable Care Act directly challenged here is the Medicaid expansion . Enacted in 1965 , Medicaid offers federal funding to States to assist pregnant women , children , needy families , the blind , the elderly , and the disabled in obtaining medical care . See 42 U. S. C. § 1396a(a)(10 ) . In order to receive that funding , States must comply with federal criteria governing matters such as who receives care and what services are provided at what cost . By 1982 every State had chosen to participate in Medicaid . Federal funds received through the Medicaid program have become a substantial part of state budgets , now constituting over 10 percent of most States' total revenue .	unmatched
The Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medicaid program and increases the number of individuals the States must cover . For example , the Act requires state programs to provide Medicaid coverage to adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level , whereas many States now cover adults with children only if their income is considerably lower , and do not cover childless adults at all . See § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII ) . The Act increases federal funding to cover the States' costs in expanding Medicaid coverage , although States will bear a portion of the costs on their own . § 1396d(y)(1 ) . If a State does not comply with the Act 's new coverage requirements , it may lose not only the federal funding for those requirements , but all of its federal Medicaid funds . See § 1396c .	unmatched
Along with their challenge to the individual mandate , the state plaintiffs in the Eleventh Circuit argued that the Medicaid expansion exceeds Congress 's constitutional powers . The Court of Appeals unanimously held that the Medicaid expansion is a valid exercise of Congress 's power under the Spending Clause . U. S. Const . , Art . I , § 8 , cl . 1 . And the court rejected the States' claim that the threatened loss of all federal Medicaid funding violates the Tenth Amendment by coercing them into complying with the Medicaid expansion . 648 F. 3d , at 1264 , 1268 .	tenth_amendment
We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit with respect to both the individual mandate and the Medicaid expansion . 565 U. S. _ _ _ ( 2011 ) . Because no party supports the Eleventh Circuit 's holding that the individual mandate canbe completely severed from the remainder of the Affordable Care Act , we appointed an amicus curiae to defend that aspect of the judgment below . And because there is a reasonable argument that the Anti - Injunction Act deprives us of jurisdiction to hear challenges to the individ - ual mandate , but no party supports that proposition , we appointed an amicus curiae to advance it . 2	unmatched
II	unmatched
Before turning to the merits , we need to be sure we have the authority to do so . The Anti - Injunction Act provides that " no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any courtby any person , whether or not such person is the per - son against whom such tax was assessed . " 26 U. S. C. § 7421(a ) . This statute protects the Government 's ability to collect a consistent stream of revenue , by barring litigation to enjoin or otherwise obstruct the collection of taxes . Because of the Anti - Injunction Act , taxes can ordinarily be challenged only after they are paid , by suing for a refund . See Enochs v. Williams Packing & Nav . Co. , 370 U. S. 1–8 ( 1962 ) .	unmatched
The penalty for not complying with the Affordable Care Act 's individual mandate first becomes enforceable in 2014 . The present challenge to the mandate thus seeks to restrain the penalty 's future collection . Amicus contends that the Internal Revenue Code treats the penalty as a tax , and that the Anti - Injunction Act therefore bars this suit .	unmatched
The text of the pertinent statutes suggests otherwise . The Anti - Injunction Act applies to suits " for the purposeof restraining the assessment or collection of any tax . " § 7421(a ) ( emphasis added ) . Congress , however , chose to describe the " [ s]hared responsibility payment " imposed on those who forgo health insurance not as a " tax , " but as a " penalty . " § § 5000A(b ) , ( g)(2 ) . There is no immediate reason to think that a statute applying to " any tax " would apply to a " penalty . "	unmatched
Congress 's decision to label this exaction a " penalty " rather than a " tax " is significant because the Affordable Care Act describes many other exactions it creates as " taxes . " See Thomas More , 651 F. 3d , at 551 . Where Congress uses certain language in one part of a statute and different language in another , it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally . See Russello v. United States , 464 U. S. 16 , 23 ( 1983 ) .	unmatched
Amicus argues that even though Congress did not label the shared responsibility payment a tax , we should treat it as such under the Anti - Injunction Act because it functions like a tax . It is true that Congress can not change whether an exaction is a tax or a penalty for constitutional pur - poses simply by describing it as one or the other . Congress may not , for example , expand its power under the Taxing Clause , or escape the Double Jeopardy Clause 's constraint on criminal sanctions , by labeling a severe financial pun - ishment a " tax . " See Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co. , 259 U. S. 20–37 ( 1922 ) ; Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch , 511 U. S. 767 , 779 ( 1994 ) .	articlei#section8,fifth_amendment
The Anti - Injunction Act and the Affordable Care Act , however , are creatures of Congress 's own creation . How they relate to each other is up to Congress , and the best evidence of Congress 's intent is the statutory text . We have thus applied the Anti - Injunction Act to statutorily described " taxes " even where that label was inaccurate . See Bailey v. George , 259 U. S. 16 ( 1922 ) ( Anti - Injunction Act applies to " Child Labor Tax " struck down as exceeding Congress 's taxing power in Drexel Furniture ) .	articlei#section8
Congress can , of course , describe something as a penalty but direct that it nonetheless be treated as a tax for purposes of the Anti - Injunction Act . For example , 26 U. S. C. § 6671(a ) provides that " any reference in this title to ‘ tax' imposed by this title shall be deemed also to refer to the penalties and liabilities provided by " subchapter 68B of the Internal Revenue Code . Penalties in subchapter 68B are thus treated as taxes under Title 26 , which includes the Anti - Injunction Act . The individual mandate , however , is not in subchapter 68B of the Code . Nor does any other provision state that references to taxes in Title 26 shall also be " deemed " to apply to the individual mandate .	unmatched
Amicus attempts to show that Congress did render the Anti - Injunction Act applicable to the individual mandate , albeit by a more circuitous route . Section 5000A(g)(1 ) spec - ifies that the penalty for not complying with the man - date " shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as an assessable penalty under subchapter B of chapter 68 . " Assessable penalties in subchapter 68B , in turn , " shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes . " § 6671(a ) . According to amicus , by directing that the penalty be " assessed and collected in the same man - ner as taxes , " § 5000A(g)(1 ) made the Anti - Injunction Act applicable to this penalty .	unmatched
The Government disagrees . It argues that § 5000A(g)(1 ) does not direct courts to apply the Anti - Injunction Act , because § 5000A(g ) is a directive only to the Secretary of the Treasury to use the same " ‘ methodology and procedures' " to collect the penalty that he uses to collect taxes . Brief for United States 32–33 ( quoting Seven - Sky , 661 F. 3d , at 11 ) .	unmatched
We think the Government has the better reading . Asit observes , " Assessment " and " Collection " are chapters of the Internal Revenue Code providing the Secretary author - ity to assess and collect taxes , and generally specifyingthe means by which he shall do so . See § 6201 ( assess - ment authority ) ; § 6301 ( collection authority ) . Section 5000A(g)(1 ) 's command that the penalty be " assessed and collected in the same manner " as taxes is best read as referring to those chapters and giving the Secretary the same authority and guidance with respect to the penalty . That interpretation is consistent with the remainder of § 5000A(g ) , which instructs the Secretary on the tools he may use to collect the penalty . See § 5000A(g)(2)(A ) ( barring criminal prosecutions ) ; § 5000A(g)(2)(B ) ( prohibiting the Secretary from using notices of lien and levies ) . The Anti - Injunction Act , by contrast , says nothing about the procedures to be used in assessing and collecting taxes .	unmatched
Amicus argues in the alternative that a different section of the Internal Revenue Code requires courts to treat the penalty as a tax under the Anti - Injunction Act . Section 6201(a ) authorizes the Secretary to make " assessments of all taxes ( including interest , additional amounts , additions to the tax , and assessable penalties ) . " ( Emphasis added . ) Amicus contends that the penalty must be a tax , because it is an assessable penalty and § 6201(a ) says that taxes include assessable penalties .	unmatched
That argument has force only if § 6201(a ) is read in isolation . The Code contains many provisions treating taxes and assessable penalties as distinct terms . See , e.g.,§§860(h)(1 ) , 6324A(a ) , 6601(e)(1)–(2 ) , 6602 , 7122(b ) . There would , for example , be no need for § 6671(a ) to deem " tax " to refer to certain assessable penalties if the Code al - ready included all such penalties in the term " tax . " Indeed , amicus 's earlier observation that the Code requires assessable penalties to be assessed and collected " in the same manner as taxes " makes little sense if assessable penalties are themselves taxes . In light of the Code 's consistent distinction between the terms " tax " and " assessable penalty , " we must accept the Government 's in - terpretation : § 6201(a ) instructs the Secretary that his authority to assess taxes includes the authority to assess penalties , but it does not equate assessable penalties to taxes for other purposes .	unmatched
The Affordable Care Act does not require that the penalty for failing to comply with the individual mandate be treated as a tax for purposes of the Anti - Injunction Act . The Anti - Injunction Act therefore does not apply to this suit , and we may proceed to the merits .	unmatched
III	unmatched
The Government advances two theories for the proposition that Congress had constitutional authority to enact the individual mandate . First , the Government argues that Congress had the power to enact the mandate under the Commerce Clause . Under that theory , Congress may order individuals to buy health insurance because the failure to do so affects interstate commerce , and could un - dercut the Affordable Care Act 's other reforms . Second , the Government argues that if the commerce power does not support the mandate , we should nonetheless uphold it as an exercise of Congress 's power to tax . According to the Government , even if Congress lacks the power to direct individuals to buy insurance , the only effect of the individual mandate is to raise taxes on those who do not do so , and thus the law may be upheld as a tax .	articlei#section8
A	unmatched
The Government 's first argument is that the individual mandate is a valid exercise of Congress 's power under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause . According to the Government , the health care market is characterized by a significant cost - shifting problem . Everyone will eventually need health care at a time and to an extent they can not predict , but if they do not have insurance , they often will not be able to pay for it . Because state and federal laws nonetheless require hospitals to provide a certain degree of care to individuals without regard to their ability to pay , see , e.g. , 42 U. S. C. § 1395dd ; Fla. Stat . Ann . § 395.1041 , hospitals end up receiving compensation for only a portion of the services they provide . To recoup the losses , hospitals pass on the cost to insurers through higher rates , and insurers , in turn , pass on the cost to policy holders in the form of higher premiums . Congress estimated that the cost of uncompensated care raises family health insurance premiums , on average , by over $ 1,000 per year . 42 U. S. C. § 18091(2)(F ) .	articlei#section8
In the Affordable Care Act , Congress addressed the problem of those who can not obtain insurance coverage because of preexisting conditions or other health issues . It did so through the Act 's " guaranteed - issue " and " community - rating " provisions . These provisions together prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage to those with such conditions or charging unhealthy individuals higher premiums than healthy individuals . See § § 300gg , 300gg–1 , 300gg–3 , 300gg–4 .	unmatched
The guaranteed - issue and community - rating reforms do not , however , address the issue of healthy individuals who choose not to purchase insurance to cover potential health care needs . In fact , the reforms sharply exacerbate that problem , by providing an incentive for individuals to delay purchasing health insurance until they become sick , relying on the promise of guaranteed and affordable coverage . The reforms also threaten to impose massive new costs on insurers , who are required to accept unhealthy individuals but prohibited from charging them rates necessary to pay for their coverage . This will lead insurers to significantly increase premiums on everyone . See Brief for America 's Health Insurance Plans et al . as Amici Curiae in No . 11–393 etc . 8–9 .	unmatched
The individual mandate was Congress 's solution to these problems . By requiring that individuals purchase health insurance , the mandate prevents cost - shifting by those who would otherwise go without it . In addition , the mandate forces into the insurance risk pool more healthy individuals , whose premiums on average will be higher than their health care expenses . This allows insurers to subsidize the costs of covering the unhealthy individuals the reforms require them to accept . The Government claims that Congress has power under the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses to enact this solution .	articlei#section8
1	unmatched
The Government contends that the individual mandate is within Congress 's power because the failure to pur - chase insurance " has a substantial and deleterious effect on interstate commerce " by creating the cost - shifting prob - lem . Brief for United States 34 . The path of our Commerce Clause decisions has not always run smooth , see United States v. Lopez , 514 U. S. 549–559 ( 1995 ) , but it is now well established that Congress has broad authority under the Clause . We have recognized , for example , that " [ t]he power of Congress over interstate commerce is not confined to the regulation of commerce among the states , " but extends to activities that " have a substantial effect on interstate commerce . " United States v. Darby , 312 U. S. 100–119 ( 1941 ) . Congress 's power , more - over , is not limited to regulation of an activity that by itself substantially affects interstate commerce , but also extends to activities that do so only when aggregated with similar activities of others . See Wickard , 317 U. S. , at 127–128 .	articlei#section8
Given its expansive scope , it is no surprise that Congress has employed the commerce power in a wide variety of ways to address the pressing needs of the time . But Congress has never attempted to rely on that power to compel individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase an unwanted product . 3 Legislative novelty is not nec - essarily fatal ; there is a first time for everything . But sometimes " the most telling indication of [ a ] severe con - stitutional problem . . . is the lack of historical precedent " for Congress 's action . Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Com pany Accounting Oversight Bd . , 561 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2010 ) ( slip op . , at 25 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . At the very least , we should " pause to consider the implications of the Government 's arguments " when confronted with such new conceptions of federal power . Lopez , supra , at 564 .	articlei#section8
The Constitution grants Congress the power to " regulate Commerce . " Art . I , § 8 , cl . 3 ( emphasis added ) . The power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated . If the power to " regulate " something included the power to create it , many of the provisions in the Constitution would be superfluous . For example , the Constitution gives Congress the power to " coin Money , " in addition to the power to " regulate the Value thereof . " Id. , cl . 5 . And it gives Congress the power to " raise and support Armies " and to " provide and maintain a Navy , " in addition to the power to " make Rulesfor the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces . " Id. , cls . 12–14 . If the power to regulate the armed forces or the value of money included the power to bring the subject of the regulation into existence , the specific grant of such powers would have been unnecessary . The language of the Constitution reflects the natural understanding that the power to regulate assumes there is already something to be regulated . See Gibbons , 9 Wheat . , at 188 ( " [ T]he enlightened patriots who framed our constitution , and the people who adopted it , must be understood to have employed words in their natural sense , and to have intended what they have said " ) . 4	articlei#section8
Our precedent also reflects this understanding . As expansive as our cases construing the scope of the commerce power have been , they all have one thing in common : They uniformly describe the power as reaching"activity . " It is nearly impossible to avoid the word when quoting them . See , e.g. , Lopez , supra , at 560 ( " Where economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce , legislation regulating that activity will be sustained " ) ; Perez , 402 U. S. , at 154 ( " Where the class of activities is regulated and that class is within the reach of federal power , the courts have no power to excise , as trivial , individual instances of the class " ( emphasis in original ; internal quotation marks omitted ) ) ; Wickard , supra , at 125 ( " [ E]ven if appellee 's activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce , it may still , whatever its nature , be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce " ) ; NLRB v.

The individual mandate , however , does not regulate existing commercial activity . It instead compels individ - uals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product , on the ground that their failure to do so affects interstate commerce . Construing the Commerce Clause to permit Con - gress to regulate individuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a new and potentially vast do - main to congressional authority . Every day individuals do not do an infinite number of things . In some cases they decide not to do something ; in others they simply fail todo it . Allowing Congress to justify federal regulation by pointing to the effect of inaction on commerce would bring countless decisions an individual could potentially make within the scope of federal regulation , and — under the Government 's theory — empower Congress to make those decisions for him .	articlei#section8
Applying the Government 's logic to the familiar case of Wickard v. Filburn shows how far that logic would carry us from the notion of a government of limited powers . In Wickard , the Court famously upheld a federal penalty im - posed on a farmer for growing wheat for consumptionon his own farm . 317 U. S. , at 114–115 , 128–129 . That amount of wheat caused the farmer to exceed his quota under a program designed to support the price of wheat by limiting supply . The Court rejected the farmer 's argument that growing wheat for home consumption was beyond the reach of the commerce power . It did so on the ground that the farmer 's decision to grow wheat for his own use allowed him to avoid purchasing wheat in the market . That decision , when considered in the aggregate along with sim - ilar decisions of others , would have had a substantial ef - fect on the interstate market for wheat . Id. , at 127–129 .	articlei#section8
Wickard has long been regarded as " perhaps the most far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity , " Lopez , 514 U. S. , at 560 , but the Government 's theory in this case would go much further . Under Wickard it is within Congress 's power to regulate the market for wheat by supporting its price . But price can be supported by increasing demand as well as by decreasing supply . The aggregated decisions of some consumers not to purchase wheat have a substantial effect on the price of wheat , just as decisions not to purchase health insurance have on the price of insurance . Congress can therefore command that those not buying wheat do so , just as it argues here that it may command that those not buying health insurance do so . The farmer in Wickard was at least actively engaged in the production of wheat , and the Government could regulate that activity because of its effect on commerce . The Government 's theory here would effectively override that limitation , by establishing that individuals may be regulated under the Commerce Clause whenever enough of them are not doing something the Government would have them do .	articlei#section8
Indeed , the Government 's logic would justify a mandatory purchase to solve almost any problem . See Seven - Sky , 661 F. 3d , at 14–15 ( noting the Government 's inabilityto " identify any mandate to purchase a product or ser - vice in interstate commerce that would be unconstitu - tional " under its theory of the commerce power ) . Toconsider a different example in the health care market , many Americans do not eat a balanced diet . That group makes up a larger percentage of the total population than those without health insurance . See , e.g. , Dept . of Agriculture and Dept . of Health and Human Services , Dietary Guidelines for Americans 1 ( 2010 ) . The failure of that groupto have a healthy diet increases health care costs , to agreater extent than the failure of the uninsured to purchase insurance . See , e.g. , Finkelstein , Trogdon , Cohen , & Dietz , Annual Medical Spending Attributable to Obesity : Payer- and Service - Specific Estimates , 28 Health Affairs w822 ( 2009 ) ( detailing the " undeniable link between ris - ing rates of obesity and rising medical spending , " and esti - mating that " the annual medical burden of obesity has risen to almost 10 percent of all medical spending and could amount to $ 147 billion per year in 2008 " ) . Those in - creased costs are borne in part by other Americans who must pay more , just as the uninsured shift costs to the insured . See Center for Applied Ethics , Voluntary Health Risks : Who Should Pay ? , 6 Issues in Ethics 6 ( 1993 ) ( noting " overwhelming evidence that individuals with unhealthy habits pay only a fraction of the costs associated with their behaviors ; most of the expense is borne by the rest of society in the form of higher insurance premiums , government expenditures for health care , and disability benefits " ) . Congress addressed the insurance problem by ordering everyone to buy insurance . Under the Gov - ernment 's theory , Congress could address the diet problem by ordering everyone to buy vegetables . See Dietary Guidelines , supra , at 19 ( " Improved nutrition , appropriate eating behaviors , and increased physical activity have tre - mendous potential to . . . reduce health care costs " ) .	articlei#section8
People , for reasons of their own , often fail to do things that would be good for them or good for society . Those failures — joined with the similar failures of others — can readily have a substantial effect on interstate commerce . Under the Government 's logic , that authorizes Congress to use its commerce power to compel citizens to act as the Government would have them act .	articlei#section8
That is not the country the Framers of our Constitution envisioned . James Madison explained that the Commerce Clause was " an addition which few oppose and from which no apprehensions are entertained . " The Federalist No . 45 , at 293 . While Congress 's authority under the Commerce Clause has of course expanded with the growth of the national economy , our cases have " always recognized that the power to regulate commerce , though broad indeed , has limits . " Maryland v. Wirtz , 392 U. S. 183 , 196 ( 1968 ) . The Government 's theory would erode those limits , permitting Congress to reach beyond the natural extent of its authority , " everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex . " The Federalist No . 48 , at 309 ( J. Madison ) . Congress already enjoys vast power to regulate much of what we do . Acceptingthe Government 's theory would give Congress the same license to regulate what we do not do , fundamentally changing the relation between the citizen and the Federal Government . 6	articlei#section8
To an economist , perhaps , there is no difference between activity and inactivity ; both have measurable economic effects on commerce . But the distinction between doing something and doing nothing would not have been lost on the Framers , who were " practical statesmen , " not metaphysical philosophers . Industrial Union Dept . , AFL – CIO v. American Petroleum Institute , 448 U. S. 607 , 673 ( 1980 ) ( Rehnquist , J. , concurring in judgment ) . As we have ex - plained , " the framers of the Constitution were not mere visionaries , toying with speculations or theories , butpractical men , dealing with the facts of political life as they understood them , putting into form the government they were creating , and prescribing in language clearand intelligible the powers that government was to take . " South Carolina v. United States , 199 U. S. 437 , 449 ( 1905 ) . The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce , not to compel it , and for over 200 years both our decisions and Congress 's actions have reflected this understanding . There is no reason to depart from that understanding now .	articlei#section8
The Government sees things differently . It argues that because sickness and injury are unpredictable but unavoidable , " the uninsured as a class are active in the market for health care , which they regularly seek and obtain . " Brief for United States 50 . The individual mandate " merely regulates how individuals finance and pay for that active participation — requiring that they do so through insurance , rather than through attempted self - insurance with the back - stop of shifting costs to others . " Ibid .	unmatched
The Government repeats the phrase " active in the market for health care " throughout its brief , see i d . , at 7 , 18 , 34 , 50 , but that concept has no constitutional significance . An individual who bought a car two years ago and may buy another in the future is not " active in the car market " in any pertinent sense . The phrase " active in the market " can not obscure the fact that most of those regulated bythe individual mandate are not currently engaged in any commercial activity involving health care , and that fact is fatal to the Government 's effort to " regulate the uninsured as a class . " Id. , at 42 . Our precedents recognize Congress 's power to regulate " class[es ] of activities , " Gonzales v. Raich , 545 U. S. 1 , 17 ( 2005 ) ( emphasis added ) , not classes of individuals , apart from any activity in which they are engaged , see , e.g. , Perez , 402 U. S. , at 153 ( " Petitioner is clearly a member of the class which engages in ‘ extortionate credit transactions' . . . " ( emphasis deleted ) ) .	articlei#section8
The individual mandate 's regulation of the uninsured as a class is , in fact , particularly divorced from any link to existing commercial activity . The mandate primarily affects healthy , often young adults who are less likely to need significant health care and have other priorities for spending their money . It is precisely because these individuals , as an actuarial class , incur relatively low health care costs that the mandate helps counter the effect of forcing insurance companies to cover others who impose greater costs than their premiums are allowed to reflect . See 42 U. S. C. § 18091(2)(I ) ( recognizing that the mandate would " broaden the health insurance risk pool to include healthy individuals , which will lower health insurance premiums " ) . If the individual mandate is targeted at a class , it is a class whose commercial inactivity rather than activity is its defining feature .	unmatched
The Government , however , claims that this does not matter . The Government regards it as sufficient to trigger Congress 's authority that almost all those who are uninsured will , at some unknown point in the future , engagein a health care transaction . Asserting that " [ t]here is no temporal limitation in the Commerce Clause , " the Government argues that because " [ e]veryone subject to this regulation is in or will be in the health care market , " they can be " regulated in advance . " Tr . of Oral Arg . 109 ( Mar. 27 , 2012 ) .	articlei#section8
The proposition that Congress may dictate the conduct of an individual today because of prophesied future ac - tivity finds no support in our precedent . We have said that Congress can anticipate the effects on commerce of an eco - nomic activity . See , e.g. , Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB , 305 U. S. 197 ( 1938 ) ( regulating the labor practices of utility companies ) ; Heart of Atlanta Motel , Inc. v. United States , 379 U. S. 241 ( 1964 ) ( prohibiting discrimination by hotel operators ) ; Katzenbach v. McClung , 379 U. S. 294 ( 1964 ) ( prohibiting discrimination by restaurant owners ) . But we have never permitted Congress to anticipate that activity itself in order to regulate individuals not currently engaged in commerce . Each one of our cases , including those cited by Justice Ginsburg , post , at 20–21 , involved preexisting economic activity . See , e.g. , Wickard , 317 U. S. , at 127–129 ( producing wheat ) ; Raich , supra , at 25 ( growing marijuana ) .	articlei#section8
Everyone will likely participate in the markets for food , clothing , transportation , shelter , or energy ; that does not authorize Congress to direct them to purchase particular products in those or other markets today . The Commerce Clause is not a general license to regulate an individual from cradle to grave , simply because he will predictably engage in particular transactions . Any police power to regulate individuals as such , as opposed to their activities , remains vested in the States .	articlei#section8
The Government argues that the individual mandate can be sustained as a sort of exception to this rule , because health insurance is a unique product . According to the Government , upholding the individual mandate wouldnot justify mandatory purchases of items such as cars or broccoli because , as the Government puts it , " [ h]ealth in - surance is not purchased for its own sake like a car or broccoli ; it is a means of financing health - care consumption and covering universal risks . " Reply Brief for United States 19 . But cars and broccoli are no more purchased for their " own sake " than health insurance . They are purchased to cover the need for transportation and food .	unmatched
The Government says that health insurance and health care financing are " inherently integrated . " Brief for United States 41 . But that does not mean the compelled purchase of the first is properly regarded as a regulation of the second . No matter how " inherently integrated " health insurance and health care consumption may be , they are not the same thing : They involve different transactions , entered into at different times , with different providers . And for most of those targeted by the mandate , significant health care needs will be years , or even decades , away . The proximity and degree of connection between themandate and the subsequent commercial activity is too lack - ing to justify an exception of the sort urged by the Gov - ernment . The individual mandate forces individualsinto commerce precisely because they elected to refrainfrom commercial activity . Such a law can not be sus - tained under a clause authorizing Congress to " regulate Commerce . "	articlei#section8

The Government next contends that Congress has the power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact the individual mandate because the mandate is an " integral part of a comprehensive scheme of economic regulation"—the guaranteed - issue and community - rating insurance reforms . Brief for United States 24 . Under this argument , it is not necessary to consider the effect that an individual 's inactivity may have on interstate commerce ; it is enough that Congress regulate commercial activity in a way that requires regulation of inactivity to be effective .	articlei#section8
The power to " make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution " the powers enumerated in the Constitution , Art . I , § 8 , cl . 18 , vests Congress with authority to enact provisions " incidental to the [ enumerated ] power , and conducive to its beneficial exercise , " McCulloch , 4 Wheat . , at 418 . Although the Clause gives Congress authority to " legislate on that vast massof incidental powers which must be involved in the con - stitution , " it does not license the exercise of any " great substantive and independent power[s ] " beyond those specifi - cally enumerated . Id. , at 411 , 421 . Instead , the Clause is " ‘ merely a declaration , for the removal of all uncertainty , that the means of carrying into execution those [ powers ] otherwise granted are included in the grant.' " Kinsella v. United States ex rel . Singleton , 361 U. S. 234 , 247 ( 1960 ) ( quoting VI Writings of James Madison 383 ( G. Hunt ed . 1906 ) ) .	articlei#section8
As our jurisprudence under the Necessary and Proper Clause has developed , we have been very deferential to Congress 's determination that a regulation is " necessary . " We have thus upheld laws that are " ‘ convenient , or use - ful' or ‘ conducive' to the authority 's ‘ beneficial exercise.' " Comstock , 560 U. S. , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 5 ) ( quoting McCulloch , supra , at 413 , 418 ) . But we have also carried out our responsibility to declare unconstitutional those laws that undermine the structure of government established by the Constitution . Such laws , which are not " consist[ent ] with the letter and spirit of the constitution , " McCulloch , supra , at 421 , are not " proper [ means ] for carrying into Execution " Congress 's enumerated powers . Rather , they are , " in the words of The Federalist , ‘ merely acts of usurpation' which ‘ deserve to be treated as such.' " Printz v. United States , 521 U. S. 898 , 924 ( 1997 ) ( alterations omitted ) ( quoting The Federalist No . 33 , at 204 ( A. Hamilton ) ) ; see also New York , 505 U. S. , at 177 ; Comstock , supra , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 5 ) ( Kennedy , J. , concurring in judgment ) ( " It is of fundamental importance to consider whether essential attributes of state sovereignty are compromised by the assertion of federal power under the Necessary and Proper Clause . . . " ) .	articlei#section8
Applying these principles , the individual mandate can not be sustained under the Necessary and Proper Clause as an essential component of the insurance reforms . Each of our prior cases upholding laws under that Clause involved exercises of authority derivative of , and in service to , a granted power . For example , we have upheld provisions permitting continued confinement of those already in federal custody when they could not be safely released , Comstock , supra , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 1–2 ) ; criminaliz - ing bribes involving organizations receiving federal funds , Sabri v. United States , 541 U. S. 600 , 602 , 605 ( 2004 ) ; and tolling state statutes of limitations while cases are pending in federal court , Jinks v. Richland County , 538U. S. 456 , 459 , 462 ( 2003 ) . The individual mandate , by con - trast , vests Congress with the extraordinary ability to create the necessary predicate to the exercise of an enumerated power .	articlei#section8
This is in no way an authority that is " narrow in scope , " Comstock , supra , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 20 ) , or " incidental " to the exercise of the commerce power , McCulloch , supra , at 418 . Rather , such a conception of the Necessary and Proper Clause would work a substantial expansion of federal authority . No longer would Congress be limited to regulating under the Commerce Clause those who by some preexisting activity bring themselves within the sphere of federal regulation . Instead , Congress could reach beyond the natural limit of its authority and draw within its regulatory scope those who otherwise would be outside of it . Even if the individual mandate is " necessary " to the Act 's insurance reforms , such an expansion of federal power is not a " proper " means for making those reforms effective .	articlei#section8
The Government relies primarily on our decision in Gonzales v. Raich . In Raich , we considered " comprehensive legislation to regulate the interstate market " in marijuana . 545 U. S. , at 22 . Certain individuals sought an exemption from that regulation on the ground that they engaged in only intrastate possession and consumption . We denied any exemption , on the ground that marijuana is a fungible commodity , so that any marijuana couldbe readily diverted into the interstate market . Congress 's attempt to regulate the interstate market for marijuana would therefore have been substantially undercut if it could not also regulate intrastate possession and consumption . Id. , at 19 . Accordingly , we recognized that " Congress was acting well within its authority " under the Necessary and Proper Clause even though its " regulation ensnare[d ] some purely intrastate activity . " Id. , at 22 ; see also Perez , 402 U. S. , at 154 . Raich thus did not involve the exercise of any " great substantive and independent power , " McCulloch , supra , at 411 , of the sort at issue here . Instead , it concerned only the constitutionality of " individual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme . " Raich , supra , at 23 ( emphasis added ) .	articlei#section8
Just as the individual mandate can not be sustained asa law regulating the substantial effects of the failure to purchase health insurance , neither can it be upheld asa " necessary and proper " component of the insurance re - forms . The commerce power thus does not authorize the mandate . Accord , post , at 4–16 ( joint opinion of Scalia , Kennedy , Thomas , and Alito , JJ . , dissenting ) .	articlei#section8

That is not the end of the matter . Because the Commerce Clause does not support the individual mandate , it is necessary to turn to the Government 's second argument : that the mandate may be upheld as within Congress 's enumerated power to " lay and collect Taxes . " Art . I , § 8 , cl . 1 .	articlei#section8
The Government 's tax power argument asks us to view the statute differently than we did in considering its commerce power theory . In making its Commerce Clause argument , the Government defended the mandate as a regulation requiring individuals to purchase health in - surance . The Government does not claim that the taxing power allows Congress to issue such a command . Instead , the Government asks us to read the mandate not as ordering individuals to buy insurance , but rather as imposing a tax on those who do not buy that product .	articlei#section8
The text of a statute can sometimes have more than one possible meaning . To take a familiar example , a law that reads " no vehicles in the park " might , or might not , ban bicycles in the park . And it is well established that ifa statute has two possible meanings , one of which violates the Constitution , courts should adopt the meaning that does not do so . Justice Story said that 180 years ago : " No court ought , unless the terms of an act rendered it unavoidable , to give a construction to it which should involve a violation , however unintentional , of the constitution . " Parsons v. Bedford , 3 Pet . 433 , 448–449 ( 1830 ) . Justice Holmes made the same point a century later : " [ T]he rule is settled that as between two possible interpretations of a statute , by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the other valid , our plain duty is to adopt that which will save the Act . " Blodgett v. Holden , 275 U. S. 142 , 148 ( 1927 ) ( concurring opinion ) .	unmatched
The most straightforward reading of the mandate is that it commands individuals to purchase insurance . After all , it states that individuals " shall " maintain health insurance . 26 U. S. C. § 5000A(a ) . Congress thought it could enact such a command under the Commerce Clause , and the Government primarily defended the law on that basis . But , for the reasons explained above , the Commerce Clause does not give Congress that power . Under our precedent , it is therefore necessary to ask whether the Government 's alternative reading of the statute — that it only imposes a tax on those without insurance — is a reasonable one .	articlei#section8
Under the mandate , if an individual does not maintain health insurance , the only consequence is that he must make an additional payment to the IRS when he pays his taxes . See § 5000A(b ) . That , according to the Government , means the mandate can be regarded as establishing a condition — not owning health insurance — that triggers a tax — the required payment to the IRS . Under that theory , the mandate is not a legal command to buy insurance . Rather , it makes going without insurance just another thing the Government taxes , like buying gasoline or earning income . And if the mandate is in effect just a tax hike on certain taxpayers who do not have health insurance , it may be within Congress 's constitutional power to tax .	articlei#section8
The question is not whether that is the most natural interpretation of the mandate , but only whether it is a " fairly possible " one . Crowell v. Benson , 285 U. S. 22 , 62 ( 1932 ) . As we have explained , " every reasonable construction must be resorted to , in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality . " Hooper v. California , 155 U. S. 648 , 657 ( 1895 ) . The Government asks us to interpret the mandate as imposing a tax , if it would otherwise violate the Constitution . Granting the Act the full measure of deference owed to federal statutes , it can be so read , for the reasons set forth below .	unmatched

The exaction the Affordable Care Act imposes on those without health insurance looks like a tax in many respects . The " [ s]hared responsibility payment , " as the statute entitles it , is paid into the Treasury by " taxpayer[s ] " when they file their tax returns . 26 U. S. C. § 5000A(b ) . It does not apply to individuals who do notpay federal income taxes because their household incomeis less than the filing threshold in the Internal Revenue Code . § 5000A(e)(2 ) . For taxpayers who do owe the payment , its amount is determined by such familiar factors as taxable income , number of dependents , and joint filing status . § § 5000A(b)(3 ) , ( c)(2 ) , ( c)(4 ) . The requirement to pay is found in the Internal Revenue Code and enforced by the IRS , which — as we previously explained — must assess and collect it " in the same manner as taxes . " Supra , at 13–14 . This process yields the essential feature of any tax : it produces at least some revenue for the Government . United States v. Kahriger , 345 U. S. 22 , n. 4 ( 1953 ) . Indeed , the payment is expected to raise about $ 4 billion per year by 2017 . Congressional Budget Office , Payments of Penalties for Being Uninsured Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( Apr. 30 , 2010 ) , in Selected CBO Publications Related to Health Care Legislation , 2009–2010 , p. 71 ( rev . 2010 ) .	unmatched
It is of course true that the Act describes the payment as a " penalty , " not a " tax . " But while that label is fatal to the application of the Anti - Injunction Act , supra , at 12–13 , it does not determine whether the payment may be viewed as an exercise of Congress 's taxing power . It is up to Con - gress whether to apply the Anti - Injunction Act to any particular statute , so it makes sense to be guided by Congress 's choice of label on that question . That choice does not , however , control whether an exaction is within Congress 's constitutional power to tax .	articlei#section8
Our precedent reflects this : In 1922 , we decided two challenges to the " Child Labor Tax " on the same day . In the first , we held that a suit to enjoin collection of the so - called tax was barred by the Anti - Injunction Act . George , 259 U. S. , at 20 . Congress knew that suits to obstruct taxes had to await payment under the Anti - InjunctionAct ; Congress called the child labor tax a tax ; Congress therefore intended the Anti - Injunction Act to apply . In the second case , however , we held that the same exaction , although labeled a tax , was not in fact authorized by Con - gress 's taxing power . Drexel Furniture , 259 U. S. , at 38 . That constitutional question was not controlled by Congress 's choice of label .	unmatched
We have similarly held that exactions not labeled taxes nonetheless were authorized by Congress 's power to tax . In the License Tax Cases , for example , we held that federal licenses to sell liquor and lottery tickets — for which the licensee had to pay a fee — could be sustained as exercises of the taxing power . 5 Wall . , at 471 . And in New York v. United States we upheld as a tax a " surcharge " on out - of - state nuclear waste shipments , a portion of which was paid to the Federal Treasury . 505 U. S. , at 171 . We thus ask whether the shared responsibility payment fallswithin Congress 's taxing power , " [ d]isregarding the designa - tion of the exaction , and viewing its substance and application . " United States v. Constantine , 296 U. S. 287 , 294 ( 1935 ) ; cf . Quill Corp. v. North Dakota , 504 U. S. 298 , 310 ( 1992 ) ( " [ M]agic words or labels " should not " disable an otherwise constitutional levy " ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) ; Nelson v. Sears , Roebuck & Co. , 312 U. S. 359 , 363 ( 1941 ) ( " In passing on the constitutionality of a tax law , we are concerned only with its practical operation , not its definition or the precise form of descriptive words which may be applied to it " ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) ; United States v. Sotelo , 436 U. S. 268 , 275 ( 1978 ) ( " That the funds due are referred to as a ‘ penalty' . . . does not alter their essential character as taxes " ) . 7	articlei#section8
Our cases confirm this functional approach . For example , in Drexel Furniture , we focused on three practical characteristics of the so - called tax on employing child laborers that convinced us the " tax " was actually a penalty . First , the tax imposed an exceedingly heavy burden—10 percent of a company 's net income — on those who employed children , no matter how small their infraction . Second , it imposed that exaction only on those who knowingly employed underage laborers . Such scienter require - ments are typical of punitive statutes , because Congress often wishes to punish only those who intentionally break the law . Third , this " tax " was enforced in part by the Department of Labor , an agency responsible for pun - ishing violations of labor laws , not collecting revenue . 259 U. S. , at 36–37 ; see also , e.g. , Kurth Ranch , 511 U. S. , at 780–782 ( considering , inter alia , the amount of the exaction , and the fact that it was imposed for violation of a separate criminal law ) ; Constantine , supra , at 295 ( same ) .	unmatched
The same analysis here suggests that the shared responsibility payment may for constitutional purposes be considered a tax , not a penalty : First , for most Americans the amount due will be far less than the price of insurance , and , by statute , it can never be more . 8 It may often be a reasonable financial decision to make the payment rather than purchase insurance , unlike the " prohibitory " financial punishment in Drexel Furniture . 259 U. S. , at 37 . Second , the individual mandate contains no scienter requirement . Third , the payment is collected solely by the IRS through the normal means of taxation — except that the Service is not allowed to use those means most suggestive of a punitive sanction , such as criminal prosecution . See § 5000A(g)(2 ) . The reasons the Court in Drexel Furniture held that what was called a " tax " there was a penalty support the conclusion that what is called a " penalty " here may be viewed as a tax . 9	unmatched
None of this is to say that the payment is not intended to affect individual conduct . Although the payment will raise considerable revenue , it is plainly designed to expand health insurance coverage . But taxes that seek to influence conduct are nothing new . Some of our earliest federal taxes sought to deter the purchase of imported manufactured goods in order to foster the growth of domestic industry . See W. Brownlee , Federal Taxation in America 22 ( 2d ed . 2004 ) ; cf . 2 J. Story , Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States § 962 , p. 434 ( 1833 ) ( " the taxing power is often , very often , applied for other purposes , than revenue " ) . Today , federal and state taxes can compose more than half the retail price of cigarettes , not just to raise more money , but to encourage people to quit smoking . And we have upheld such obviously regulatory measures as taxes on selling marijuana and sawed - off shotguns . See United States v. Sanchez , 340 U. S. 42–45 ( 1950 ) ; Sonzinsky v. United States , 300 U. S. 506 , 513 ( 1937 ) . Indeed , " [ e]very tax is in some measure regula - tory . To some extent it interposes an economic impediment to the activity taxed as compared with others not taxed . " Sonzinsky , supra , at 513 . That § 5000A seeks to shape decisions about whether to buy health insurance does not mean that it can not be a valid exercise of the taxingpower .	unmatched
In distinguishing penalties from taxes , this Court has explained that " if the concept of penalty means anything , it means punishment for an unlawful act or omission . " United States v. Reorganized CF&I Fabricators of Utah , Inc. , 518 U. S. 213 , 224 ( 1996 ) ; see also United States v. La Franca , 282 U. S. 568 , 572 ( 1931 ) ( " [ A ] penalty , as the word is here used , is an exaction imposed by statute as punishment for an unlawful act " ) . While the individual mandate clearly aims to induce the purchase of health insurance , it need not be read to declare that failing to do so is unlawful . Neither the Act nor any other law attaches negative legal consequences to not buying health insurance , beyond requiring a payment to the IRS . The Government agrees with that reading , confirming that if someone chooses to pay rather than obtain health insurance , they have fully complied with the law . Brief for United States 60–61 ; Tr . of Oral Arg . 49–50 ( Mar. 26 , 2012 ) .	unmatched
Indeed , it is estimated that four million people each year will choose to pay the IRS rather than buy insurance . See Congressional Budget Office , supra , at 71 . We would expect Congress to be troubled by that prospect if such conduct were unlawful . That Congress apparently regards such extensive failure to comply with the mandate as tolerable suggests that Congress did not think it was creating four million outlaws . It suggests instead that the shared responsibility payment merely imposes a tax citizens may lawfully choose to pay in lieu of buying health insurance .	unmatched
The plaintiffs contend that Congress 's choice of language — stating that individuals " shall " obtain insurance or pay a " penalty"—requires reading § 5000A as punishing unlawful conduct , even if that interpretation would ren - der the law unconstitutional . We have rejected a similar argument before . In New York v. United States we examined a statute providing that " ‘ [ e]ach State shall be responsible for providing . . . for the disposal of . . . low - level radioactive waste.' " 505 U. S. , at 169 ( quoting 42 U. S. C. § 2021c(a)(1)(A ) ) . A State that shipped its waste to another State was exposed to surcharges by the receiving State , a portion of which would be paid over to the FederalGovernment . And a State that did not adhere to the statutory scheme faced " [ p]enalties for failure to comply,"including increases in the surcharge . § 2021e(e)(2 ) ; New York , 505 U. S. , at 152–153 . New York urged us to read the statute as a federal command that the state legislature enact legislation to dispose of its waste , which would have violated the Constitution . To avoid that outcome , we interpreted the statute to impose only " a series of incentives " for the State to take responsibility for its waste . We then sustained the charge paid to the Federal Government as an exercise of the taxing power . Id. , at 169–174 . We see no insurmountable obstacle to a similar approach here . 10	articlei#section8
The joint dissenters argue that we can not uphold § 5000A as a tax because Congress did not " frame " it as such . Post , at 17 . In effect , they contend that even ifthe Constitution permits Congress to do exactly what we interpret this statute to do , the law must be struck down because Congress used the wrong labels . An example may help illustrate why labels should not control here . Suppose Congress enacted a statute providing that every taxpayer who owns a house without energy efficient windows must pay $ 50 to the IRS . The amount due is adjusted based on factors such as taxable income and joint filing status , and is paid along with the taxpayer 's income tax return . Those whose income is below the filing threshold need not pay . The required payment is not called a " tax , " a " penalty , " or anything else . No one would doubt that this law imposed a tax , and was within Congress 's power to tax . That conclusion should not change simply because Congress used the word " penalty " to describe the pay - ment . Interpreting such a law to be a tax would hardly " [ i]mpos[e ] a tax through judicial legislation . " Post , at 25 . Rather , it would give practical effect to the Legislature 's enactment .	articlei#section8
Our precedent demonstrates that Congress had the power to impose the exaction in § 5000A under the taxing power , and that § 5000A need not be read to do more than impose a tax . That is sufficient to sustain it . The " question of the constitutionality of action taken by Congress does not depend on recitals of the power which it undertakes to exercise . " Woods v. Cloyd W. Miller Co. , 333 U. S. 138 , 144 ( 1948 ) .	articlei#section8
Even if the taxing power enables Congress to imposea tax on not obtaining health insurance , any tax muststill comply with other requirements in the Constitution . Plaintiffs argue that the shared responsibility payment does not do so , citing Article I , § 9 , clause 4 . That clause provides : " No Capitation , or other direct , Tax shall be laid , unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken . " This requirement means that any " direct Tax " must be apportioned so that each State pays in proportion to its population . According to the plaintiffs , if the individual mandate imposes a tax , it is a direct tax , and it is unconstitutional because Congress made no effort to apportion it among the States .	articlei#section8,articlei#section9
Even when the Direct Tax Clause was written it was unclear what else , other than a capitation ( also known as a " head tax " or a " poll tax " ) , might be a direct tax . See Springer v. United States , 102 U. S. 586–598 ( 1881 ) . Soon after the framing , Congress passed a tax on ownership of carriages , over James Madison 's objection that it was an unapportioned direct tax . Id. , at 597 . This Court upheld the tax , in part reasoning that apportioning sucha tax would make little sense , because it would have required taxing carriage owners at dramatically different rates depending on how many carriages were in their home State . See Hylton v. United States , 3 Dall . 171 , 174 ( 1796 ) ( opinion of Chase , J. ) . The Court was unanimous , and those Justices who wrote opinions either directly asserted or strongly suggested that only two forms of taxation were direct : capitations and land taxes . See i d . , at 175 ; i d . , at 177 ( opinion of Paterson , J. ) ; i d . , at 183 ( opinion of Iredell , J. ) .	articlei#section8,articlei#section9
That narrow view of what a direct tax might be per - sisted for a century . In 1880 , for example , we explained that " direct taxes , within the meaning of the Constitution , are only capitation taxes , as expressed in that instrument , and taxes on real estate . " Springer , supra , at 602 . In 1895 , we expanded our interpretation to include taxes on personal property and income from personal property , in the course of striking down aspects of the federal income tax . Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. , 158 U. S. 601 , 618 ( 1895 ) . That result was overturned by the Sixteenth Amendment , although we continued to consider taxes on personal property to be direct taxes . See Eisner v. Macom - ber , 252 U. S. 189–219 ( 1920 ) .	amendmentxvi,articlei#section9
A tax on going without health insurance does not fall within any recognized category of direct tax . It is not a capitation . Capitations are taxes paid by every person , " without regard to property , profession , or any other circumstance . " Hylton , supra , at 175 ( opinion of Chase , J. ) ( emphasis altered ) . The whole point of the shared responsibility payment is that it is triggered by specific cir - cumstances — earning a certain amount of income but not obtaining health insurance . The payment is also plainly not a tax on the ownership of land or personal property . The shared responsibility payment is thus not a direct tax that must be apportioned among the several States .	articlei#section9
There may , however , be a more fundamental objection to a tax on those who lack health insurance . Even if only a tax , the payment under § 5000A(b ) remains a burden that the Federal Government imposes for an omission , not an act . If it is troubling to interpret the Commerce Clause as authorizing Congress to regulate those who abstain from commerce , perhaps it should be similarly troubling to permit Congress to impose a tax for not doing something .	articlei#section8
Three considerations allay this concern . First , and most importantly , it is abundantly clear the Constitution does not guarantee that individuals may avoid taxation through inactivity . A capitation , after all , is a tax that every - one must pay simply for existing , and capitations are expressly contemplated by the Constitution . The Court today holds that our Constitution protects us from federal regulation under the Commerce Clause so long as we ab - stain from the regulated activity . But from its creation , the Constitution has made no such promise with respect to taxes . See Letter from Benjamin Franklin to M. Le Roy ( Nov. 13 , 1789 ) ( " Our new Constitution is now established . . . but in this world nothing can be said to be certain , except death and taxes " ) .	articlei#section8
Whether the mandate can be upheld under the Commerce Clause is a question about the scope of federal authority . Its answer depends on whether Congress can exercise what all acknowledge to be the novel course of directing individuals to purchase insurance . Congress 's use of the Taxing Clause to encourage buying something is , by contrast , not new . Tax incentives already promote , for example , purchasing homes and professional educations . See 26 U. S. C. § § 163(h ) , 25A. Sustaining the mandate as a tax depends only on whether Congress has properly exercised its taxing power to encourage purchasing health insurance , not whether it can . Upholding the individual mandate under the Taxing Clause thus does not recognize any new federal power . It determines that Congress has used an existing one .	articlei#section8
Second , Congress 's ability to use its taxing power to influence conduct is not without limits . A few of our cases policed these limits aggressively , invalidating punitive exactions obviously designed to regulate behavior otherwise regarded at the time as beyond federal authority . See , e.g. , United States v. Butler , 297 U. S. 1 ( 1936 ) ; Drexel Furniture , 259 U. S. 20 . More often and more recentlywe have declined to closely examine the regulatory motive or effect of revenue - raising measures . See Kahriger , 345 U. S. , at 27–31 ( collecting cases ) . We have nonetheless maintained that " ‘ there comes a time in the extension of the penalizing features of the so - called tax when it loses its character as such and becomes a mere penalty with the characteristics of regulation and punishment.' " Kurth Ranch , 511 U. S. , at 779 ( quoting Drexel Furniture , supra , at 38 ) .	articlei#section8
We have already explained that the shared responsibility payment 's practical characteristics pass muster as a tax under our narrowest interpretations of the taxing power . Supra , at 35–36 . Because the tax at hand iswithin even those strict limits , we need not here decide the precise point at which an exaction becomes so punitive that the taxing power does not authorize it . It remains true , however , that the " ‘ power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits.' " Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Texas Co. , 336 U. S. 342 , 364 ( 1949 ) ( quoting Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel . Knox , 277 U. S. 218 , 223 ( 1928 ) ( Holmes , J. , dissenting ) ) .	articlei#section8
Third , although the breadth of Congress 's power to tax is greater than its power to regulate commerce , the taxing power does not give Congress the same degree of control over individual behavior . Once we recognize that Congress may regulate a particular decision under the Commerce Clause , the Federal Government can bring its full weight to bear . Congress may simply command individ - uals to do as it directs . An individual who disobeys may be subjected to criminal sanctions . Those sanctions can include not only fines and imprisonment , but all the attendant consequences of being branded a criminal : deprivation of otherwise protected civil rights , such as the right to bear arms or vote in elections ; loss of employment opportunities ; social stigma ; and severe disabilities in other controversies , such as custody or immigration disputes .	articlei#section8
By contrast , Congress 's authority under the taxing power is limited to requiring an individual to pay money into the Federal Treasury , no more . If a tax is properly paid , the Government has no power to compel or punish individuals subject to it . We do not make light of the se - vere burden that taxation — especially taxation motivated by a regulatory purpose — can impose . But imposition of a tax nonetheless leaves an individual with a lawful choice to do or not do a certain act , so long as he is willing to pay a tax levied on that choice . 11	articlei#section8
The Affordable Care Act 's requirement that certain in - dividuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax . Be - cause the Constitution permits such a tax , it is not our role to forbid it , or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness .	articlei#section8

Justice Ginsburg questions the necessity of rejecting the Government 's commerce power argument , given that § 5000A can be upheld under the taxing power . Post , at 37 . But the statute reads more naturally as a command to buy insurance than as a tax , and I would uphold it as a command if the Constitution allowed it . It is only because the Commerce Clause does not authorize such a command that it is necessary to reach the taxing power question . And it is only because we have a duty to construe a stat - ute to save it , if fairly possible , that § 5000A can be interpreted as a tax . Without deciding the Commerce Clause question , I would find no basis to adopt such a saving construction .	articlei#section8
The Federal Government does not have the power to order people to buy health insurance . Section 5000A would therefore be unconstitutional if read as a command . The Federal Government does have the power to impose a tax on those without health insurance . Section 5000A is therefore constitutional , because it can reasonably be read as a tax .	articlei#section8

The States also contend that the Medicaid expansion exceeds Congress 's authority under the Spending Clause . They claim that Congress is coercing the States to adopt the changes it wants by threatening to withhold all of a State 's Medicaid grants , unless the State accepts the new expanded funding and complies with the conditions that come with it . This , they argue , violates the basic principle that the " Federal Government may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program . " New York , 505 U. S. , at 188 .	articlei#section8
There is no doubt that the Act dramatically increases state obligations under Medicaid . The current Medicaid program requires States to cover only certain discrete categories of needy individuals — pregnant women , children , needy families , the blind , the elderly , and the dis - abled . 42 U. S. C. § 1396a(a)(10 ) . There is no mandatory coverage for most childless adults , and the States typically do not offer any such coverage . The States also enjoy considerable flexibility with respect to the coverage levels for parents of needy families . § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii ) . On average States cover only those unemployed parents who make less than 37 percent of the federal poverty level , and only those employed parents who make less than 63 percent of the poverty line . Kaiser Comm'n on Medicaid and the Uninsured , Performing Under Pressure 11 , and fig . 11 ( 2012 ) .	unmatched
The Medicaid provisions of the Affordable Care Act , in contrast , require States to expand their Medicaid programs by 2014 to cover all individuals under the age of 65 with incomes below 133 percent of the federal poverty line . § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII ) . The Act also establishes a new " [ e]ssential health benefits " package , which States must provide to all new Medicaid recipients — a level sufficient to satisfy a recipient 's obligations under the individual man - date . § § 1396a(k)(1 ) , 1396u–7(b)(5 ) , 18022(b ) . The Af - fordable Care Act provides that the Federal Government will pay 100 percent of the costs of covering these newly eligible individuals through 2016 . § 1396d(y)(1 ) . In the following years , the federal payment level gradually decreases , to a minimum of 90 percent . Ibid . In light ofthe expansion in coverage mandated by the Act , the Federal Government estimates that its Medicaid spending will in - crease by approximately $ 100 billion per year , nearly 40 percent above current levels .

The Spending Clause grants Congress the power " to pay the Debts and provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United States . " U. S. Const . , Art . I , § 8 , cl . 1 . We have long recognized that Congress may use this power to grant federal funds to the States , and may condition such a grant upon the States' " taking certain actions that Congress could not require them to take . " College Savings Bank , 527 U. S. , at 686 . Such measures " encourage a Stateto regulate in a particular way , [ and ] influenc[e ] a State 's policy choices . " New York , supra , at 166 . The con - ditions imposed by Congress ensure that the funds are used by the States to " provide for the . . . general Welfare " in the manner Congress intended .	articlei#section8
At the same time , our cases have recognized limits on Congress 's power under the Spending Clause to secure state compliance with federal objectives . " We have repeatedly characterized . . . Spending Clause legislation as ‘ much in the nature of a contract.' " Barnes v. Gorman , 536 U. S. 181 , 186 ( 2002 ) ( quoting Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman , 451 U. S. 1 , 17 ( 1981 ) ) . The legitimacy of Congress 's exercise of the spending power " thus rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the ‘ contract.' " Pennhurst , supra , at 17 . Respecting this limitation is critical to ensuring that Spending Clause legislation does not undermine thestatus of the States as independent sovereigns in our fed - eral system . That system " rests on what might at first seem a counterintuitive insight , that ‘ freedom is enhanced by the creation of two governments , not one.' " Bond , 564 U. S. , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 8) ( quoting Alden v. Maine , 527 U. S. 706 , 758 ( 1999 ) ) . For this reason , " the Constitution has never been understood to confer upon Congress the ability to require the States to govern according to Congress' instructions . " New York , supra , at 162 . Otherwise the two - government system established by the Framers would give way to a system that vests power in one central government , and individual liberty would suffer .	articlei#section8
That insight has led this Court to strike down fed - eral legislation that commandeers a State 's legislative or administrative apparatus for federal purposes . See , e.g. , Printz , 521 U. S. , at 933 ( striking down federal legisla - tion compelling state law enforcement officers to perform federally mandated background checks on handgun purchasers ) ; New York , supra , at 174–175 ( invalidating provisions of an Act that would compel a State to either take title to nuclear waste or enact particular state waste regulations ) . It has also led us to scrutinize Spending Clause legislation to ensure that Congress is not using financial inducements to exert a " power akin to undue influence . " Steward Machine Co. v. Davis , 301 U. S. 548 , 590 ( 1937 ) . Congress may use its spending power to create incentives for States to act in accordance with federal policies . But when " pressure turns into compulsion , " ibid . , the legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism . " [ T]he Constitution simply does not give Congress the authority to require the States to regulate . " New York , 505 U. S. , at 178 . That is true whether Congress directly commands a State to regulate or indirectly coerces a State to adopt a federal regulatory system as its own .	articlei#section8
Permitting the Federal Government to force the States to implement a federal program would threaten the political accountability key to our federal system . " [ W]here the Federal Government directs the States to regulate , it may be state officials who will bear the brunt of public disapproval , while the federal officials who devised the regu - latory program may remain insulated from the electoral ramifications of their decision . " Id. , at 169 . Spending Clause programs do not pose this danger when a State has a legitimate choice whether to accept the federal conditions in exchange for federal funds . In such a situation , state officials can fairly be held politically accountable for choosing to accept or refuse the federal offer . But when the State has no choice , the Federal Government can achieve its objectives without accountability , just as in New York and Printz . Indeed , this danger is heightened when Congress acts under the Spending Clause , because Congress can use that power to implement federal policy it could not impose directly under its enumerated powers .	articlei#section8
We addressed such concerns in Steward Machine . That case involved a federal tax on employers that was abated if the businesses paid into a state unemployment plan that met certain federally specified conditions . An employer sued , alleging that the tax was impermissibly " driv[ing ] the state legislatures under the whip of economic pressure into the enactment of unemployment compensation laws at the bidding of the central government . " 301 U. S. , at 587 . We acknowledged the danger that the Federal Government might employ its taxing power to exert a " power akin to undue influence " upon the States . Id. , at 590 . But we observed that Congress adopted the challenged tax and abatement program to channel money to the States that would otherwise have gone into the Federal Treasury for use in providing national unemployment services . Congress was willing to direct businesses to instead pay the money into state programs only on the condition that the money be used for the same purposes . Predicating tax abatement on a State 's adoption of a particular type of un - employment legislation was therefore a means to " safeguard [ the Federal Government 's ] own treasury . " Id. , at 591 . We held that " [ i]n such circumstances , if in no others , inducement or persuasion does not go beyond the bounds of power . " Ibid .	articlei#section8
In rejecting the argument that the federal law was a " weapon [ ] of coercion , destroying or impairing the autonomy of the states , " the Court noted that there was no reason to suppose that the State in that case acted other than through " her unfettered will . " Id. , at 586 , 590 . Indeed , the State itself did " not offer a suggestion that in passing the unemployment law she was affected by duress . " Id. , at 589 .	unmatched
As our decision in Steward Machine confirms , Congress may attach appropriate conditions to federal taxing and spending programs to preserve its control over the use of federal funds . In the typical case we look to the States to defend their prerogatives by adopting " the simple expedient of not yielding " to federal blandishments when theydo not want to embrace the federal policies as their own . Massachusetts v. Mellon , 262 U. S. 447 , 482 ( 1923 ) . The States are separate and independent sovereigns . Sometimes they have to act like it .	unmatched
The States , however , argue that the Medicaid expansion is far from the typical case . They object that Congress has " crossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion , " New York , supra , at 175 , in the way it has structured the funding : Instead of simply refusing to grant the new funds to States that will not accept the new conditions , Congress has also threatened to withhold those States' existing Medicaid funds . The States claim that this threat serves no purpose other than to force unwilling States to sign up for the dramatic expansion in health care coverage effected by the Act .	unmatched
Given the nature of the threat and the programs at issue here , we must agree . We have upheld Congress 's authority to condition the receipt of funds on the States' complying with restrictions on the use of those funds , because that is the means by which Congress ensures that the funds are spent according to its view of the " general Welfare . " Conditions that do not here govern the useof the funds , however , can not be justified on that ba - sis . When , for example , such conditions take the form of threats to terminate other significant independent grants , the conditions are properly viewed as a means of pressuring the States to accept policy changes .	articlei#section8
In South Dakota v. Dole , we considered a challenge to a federal law that threatened to withhold five percent of a State 's federal highway funds if the State did not raise its drinking age to 21 . The Court found that the condition was " directly related to one of the main purposes for which highway funds are expended — safe interstate travel . " 483 U. S. , at 208 . At the same time , the condition was not a restriction on how the highway funds — set aside for specific highway improvement and maintenance efforts — were to be used .	unmatched
We accordingly asked whether " the financial inducement offered by Congress " was " so coercive as to pass the point at which ‘ pressure turns into compulsion.' " Id. , at 211 ( quoting Steward Machine , supra , at 590 ) . By " financial inducement " the Court meant the threat of losing five percent of highway funds ; no new money was offered to the States to raise their drinking ages . We found that the inducement was not impermissibly coercive , because Congress was offering only " relatively mild encouragement to the States . " Dole , 483 U. S. , at 211 . We observed that " all South Dakota would lose if she adheres to her chosen course as to a suitable minimum drinking age is 5 % " of her highway funds . Ibid . In fact , the federal funds at stake constituted less than half of one percent of South Dakota 's budget at the time . See Nat . Assn . of State Budget Officers , The State Expenditure Report 59 ( 1987 ) ; South Dakota v. Dole , 791 F. 2d 628 , 630 ( CA8 1986 ) . In consequence , " we conclude[d ] that [ the ] encouragementto state action [ was ] a valid use of the spending power . " Dole , 483 U. S. , at 212 . Whether to accept the drinking age change " remain[ed ] the prerogative of the States not merely in theory but in fact . " Id. , at 211–212 .	unmatched
In this case , the financial " inducement " Congress has chosen is much more than " relatively mild encouragement"—it is a gun to the head . Section 1396c of the Medicaid Act provides that if a State 's Medicaid plan doesnot comply with the Act 's requirements , the Secretary of Health and Human Services may declare that " further payments will not be made to the State . " 42 U. S. C. § 1396c . A State that opts out of the Affordable Care Act 's expansion in health care coverage thus stands to lose not merely " a relatively small percentage " of its existing Medicaid funding , but all of it . Dole , supra , at 211 . Medicaid spending accounts for over 20 percent of the average State 's total budget , with federal funds covering 50 to 83 percent of those costs . See Nat . Assn . of State Budget Officers , Fiscal Year 2010 State Expenditure Report , p. 11 , Table 5 ( 2011 ) ; 42 U. S. C. § 1396d(b ) . The Federal Government estimates that it will pay out approximately $ 3.3 trillion between 2010 and 2019 in order to cover the costs of pre - expansion Medicaid . Brief for United States 10 , n. 6 . In addition , the States have developed intricate statutory and administrative regimes over the course of many decades to implement their objectives under existing Medicaid . It is easy to see how the Dole Court could conclude that the threatened loss of less than half of one percent of South Dakota 's budget left that State with a " prerogative " to reject Congress 's desired policy , " not merely in theory but in fact . " 483 U. S. , at 211–212 . The threatened loss of over 10 percent of a State 's overall budget , in contrast , is economic dragooning that leaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion . 12	unmatched
Justice Ginsburg claims that Dole is distinguishable because here " Congress has not threatened to withhold funds earmarked for any other program . " Post , at 47 . But that begs the question : The States contend that the expansion is in reality a new program and that Congress is forcing them to accept it by threatening the funds for the existing Medicaid program . We can not agree that existing Medicaid and the expansion dictated by the Affordable Care Act are all one program simply because " Congress styled " them as such . Post , at 49 . If the expansion is not properly viewed as a modification of the existing Medicaid program , Congress 's decision to so title it is irrelevant . 13	unmatched
Here , the Government claims that the Medicaid expansion is properly viewed merely as a modification of the ex - isting program because the States agreed that Congress could change the terms of Medicaid when they signed on in the first place . The Government observes that the Social Security Act , which includes the original Medicaid provisions , contains a clause expressly reserving " [ t]he right to alter , amend , or repeal any provision " of that statute . 42 U. S. C. § 1304 . So it does . But " if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys , it must do so unambiguously . " Pennhurst , 451 U. S. , at 17 . A State confronted with statutory language reserving the right to " alter " or " amend " the pertinent provisions of the Social Security Act might reasonably assume that Congress was entitled to make adjustments to the Medicaid program as it developed . Congress has in fact done so , sometimes conditioning only the new funding , other times both old and new . See , e.g. , Social Security Amendments of 1972 , 86Stat . 1381–1382 , 1465 ( extending Med - icaid eligibility , but partly conditioning only the new funding ) ; Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 , § 4601 , 104Stat . 1388–166 ( extending eligibility , and conditioning old and new funds ) .	unmatched
The Medicaid expansion , however , accomplishes a shift in kind , not merely degree . The original program was de - signed to cover medical services for four particular cat - egories of the needy : the disabled , the blind , the elderly , and needy families with dependent children . See 42 U. S. C. § 1396a(a)(10 ) . Previous amendments to Medicaid eligibility merely altered and expanded the boundaries of these categories . Under the Affordable Care Act , Medicaid is transformed into a program to meet the health care needs of the entire nonelderly population with income below 133 percent of the poverty level . It is no longer a program to care for the neediest among us , but rather an element of a comprehensive national plan to provide universal health insurance coverage . 14	unmatched
Indeed , the manner in which the expansion is structured indicates that while Congress may have styled the expansion a mere alteration of existing Medicaid , it recognized it was enlisting the States in a new health care program . Congress created a separate funding provision to cover the costs of providing services to any personmade newly eligible by the expansion . While Congress pays 50 to 83 percent of the costs of covering individuals currently enrolled in Medicaid , § 1396d(b ) , once the expansion is fully implemented Congress will pay 90 percent of the costs for newly eligible persons , § 1396d(y)(1 ) . The conditions on use of the different funds are also distinct . Congress mandated that newly eligible persons receive a level of coverage that is less comprehensive than the traditional Medicaid benefit package . § 1396a(k)(1 ) ; see Brief for United States 9 .	unmatched
As we have explained , " [ t]hough Congress' power to legislate under the spending power is broad , it does not include surprising participating States with postacceptance or ‘ retroactive' conditions . " Pennhurst , supra , at 25 . A State could hardly anticipate that Congress 's reservation of the right to " alter " or " amend " the Medicaid program included the power to transform it so dramatically .	articlei#section8
Justice Ginsburg claims that in fact this expansion is no different from the previous changes to Medicaid , such that " a State would be hard put to complain that it lacked fair notice . " Post , at 56 . But the prior change she dis - cusses — presumably the most dramatic alteration she could find — does not come close to working the transformation the expansion accomplishes . She highlights an amendment requiring States to cover pregnant women and increasing the number of eligible children . Ibid . But this modification can hardly be described as a major change in a program that — from its inception — provided health care for " families with dependent children . " Previous Medicaid amendments simply do not fall into the same category as the one at stake here .	unmatched
The Court in Steward Machine did not attempt to " fix the outermost line " where persuasion gives way to coercion . 301 U. S. , at 591 . The Court found it " [ e]nough for present purposes that wherever the line may be , this statute is within it . " Ibid . We have no need to fix a line either . It is enough for today that wherever that line may be , this statute is surely beyond it . Congress may not simply " conscript state [ agencies ] into the national bureaucratic army , " FERC v. Mississippi , 456 U. S. 742 , 775 ( 1982 ) ( O'Connor , J. , concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part ) , and that is what it is attempting to do with the Medicaid expansion .	unmatched
Nothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering funds under the Affordable Care Act to expand the availability of health care , and requiring that States accepting such funds comply with the conditions on their use . What Congress is not free to do is to penalize States that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding . Section 1396c gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to do just that . It allows her to withhold all " further [ Medicaid ] payments . . . to the State " if she determines that the State is out of compliance with any Medicaid requirement , including those contained in the expansion . 42 U. S. C. § 1396c . In light of the Court 's holding , the Secretary can not apply § 1396c to withdraw existing Medicaid funds for failure to comply with the requirements set out in the expansion .	articlei#section8
That fully remedies the constitutional violation we have identified . The chapter of the United States Code that contains § 1396c includes a severability clause confirming that we need go no further . That clause specifies that " [ i]f any provision of this chapter , or the application thereof to any person or circumstance , is held invalid , the remainder of the chapter , and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby . " § 1303 . Today 's holding does not affect the continued ap - plication of § 1396c to the existing Medicaid program . Nor does it affect the Secretary 's ability to withdraw funds pro - vided under the Affordable Care Act if a State that has chosen to participate in the expansion fails to comply with the requirements of that Act .	unmatched
This is not to say , as the joint dissent suggests , that we are " rewriting the Medicaid Expansion . " Post , at 48 . Instead , we determine , first , that § 1396c is unconstitutional when applied to withdraw existing Medicaid funds from States that decline to comply with the expansion . We then follow Congress 's explicit textual instruction to leave unaffected " the remainder of the chapter , and the application of [ the challenged ] provision to other persons or circumstances . " § 1303 . When we invalidate an application of a statute because that application is unconstitutional , we are not " rewriting " the statute ; we are merely enforcing the Constitution .	unmatched
The question remains whether today 's holding affects other provisions of the Affordable Care Act . In considering that question , " [ w]e seek to determine what Congress would have intended in light of the Court 's constitutional holding . " United States v. Booker , 543 U. S. 220 , 246 ( 2005 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . Our " touchstone for any decision about remedy is legislative intent , for a court can not use its remedial powers to circum - vent the intent of the legislature . " Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng . , 546 U. S. 320 , 330 ( 2006 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . The question here is whether Congress would have wanted the rest of the Act to stand , had it known that States would have a genuine choice whether to participate in the new Medicaid expansion . Unless it is " evident " that the answer is no , we must leave the rest of the Act intact . Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Comm'n of Okla. , 286 U. S. 210 , 234 ( 1932 ) .	unmatched
We are confident that Congress would have wanted to preserve the rest of the Act . It is fair to say that Congress assumed that every State would participate in the Medicaid expansion , given that States had no real choice but to do so . The States contend that Congress enacted the rest of the Act with such full participation in mind ; they point out that Congress made Medicaid a means for satisfying the mandate , 26 U. S. C. § 5000A(f)(1)(A)(ii ) , and enacted no other plan for providing coverage to many low - income individuals . According to the States , this means that the entire Act must fall .	unmatched
We disagree . The Court today limits the financial pressure the Secretary may apply to induce States to accept the terms of the Medicaid expansion . As a practical matter , that means States may now choose to reject the expansion ; that is the whole point . But that does not mean all or even any will . Some States may indeed decline to participate , either because they are unsure they will be able to afford their share of the new funding obligations , or because they are unwilling to commit the administrative resources necessary to support the expansion . Other States , however , may voluntarily sign up , finding the idea of expanding Medicaid coverage attractive , particularly given the level of federal funding the Act offers at the outset .	unmatched
We have no way of knowing how many States will accept the terms of the expansion , but we do not believe Congress would have wanted the whole Act to fall , simply because some may choose not to participate . The other reforms Congress enacted , after all , will remain " fully operative as a law , " Champlin , supra , at 234 , and will still function in a way " consistent with Congress' basic objectives in enacting the statute , " Booker , supra , at 259 . Confident that Congress would not have intended anything different , we conclude that the rest of the Act need not fall in light of our constitutional holding .	unmatched

The Affordable Care Act is constitutional in part and unconstitutional in part . The individual mandate can not be upheld as an exercise of Congress 's power under the Commerce Clause . That Clause authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce , not to order individuals to engage in it . In this case , however , it is reasonable to con - strue what Congress has done as increasing taxes on those who have a certain amount of income , but choose to go without health insurance . Such legislation is within Con - gress 's power to tax .	articlei#section8
As for the Medicaid expansion , that portion of the Affordable Care Act violates the Constitution by threatening existing Medicaid funding . Congress has no authority to order the States to regulate according to its instructions . Congress may offer the States grants and require the States to comply with accompanying conditions , but the States must have a genuine choice whether to accept the offer . The States are given no such choice in this case : They must either accept a basic change in the nature of Medicaid , or risk losing all Medicaid funding . The remedy for that constitutional violation is to preclude the Federal Government from imposing such a sanction . That remedy does not require striking down other portions of the Affordable Care Act .	articlei#section8
The Framers created a Federal Government of limited powers , and assigned to this Court the duty of enforcing those limits . The Court does so today . But the Court does not express any opinion on the wisdom of the Affordable Care Act . Under the Constitution , that judgment is reserved to the people .	unmatched
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part .	unmatched
It is so ordered .	unmatched
I agree with The Chief Justice that the Anti - Injunction Act does not bar the Court 's consideration of this case , and that the minimum coverage provision is a proper exercise of Congress' taxing power . I therefore join Parts I , II , and III – C of The Chief Justice 's opinion . Unlike The Chief Justice , however , I would hold , alternatively , that the Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to enact the minimum coverage provision . I would also hold that the Spending Clause permits the Medicaid expansion exactly as Congress enacted it .	articlei#section8
The provision of health care is today a concern of national dimension , just as the provision of old - age and survivors' benefits was in the 1930 's . In the Social Secu - rity Act , Congress installed a federal system to provide monthly benefits to retired wage earners and , eventually , to their survivors . Beyond question , Congress could have adopted a similar scheme for health care . Congress chose , instead , to preserve a central role for private insurers and state governments . According to The Chief Justice , the Commerce Clause does not permit that preservation . This rigid reading of the Clause makes scant sense and is stunningly retrogressive .	articlei#section8
Since 1937 , our precedent has recognized Congress' large authority to set the Nation 's course in the economic and social welfare realm . See United States v. Darby , 312 U. S. 100 , 115 ( 1941 ) ( overruling Hammer v. Dagenhart , 247 U. S. 251 ( 1918 ) , and recognizing that " regulations of commerce which do not infringe some constitutional prohibi - tion are within the plenary power conferred on Congress by the Commerce Clause " ) ; NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. , 301 U. S. 1 , 37 ( 1937 ) ( " [ The commerce]power is plenary and may be exerted to protect interstate commerce no matter what the source of the dangers which threaten it . " ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) . The Chief Justice 's crabbed reading of the Commerce Clause harks back to the era in which the Court routinely thwarted Congress' efforts to regulate the national economy inthe interest of those who labor to sustain it . See , e.g. , Railroad Retirement Bd . v. Alton R. Co. , 295 U. S. 330 , 362 , 368 ( 1935 ) ( invalidating compulsory retirement and pension plan for employees of carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Act ; Court found law related essentially " to the social welfare of the worker , and therefore remote from any regulation of commerce as such " ) . It is a reading that should not have staying power .	articlei#section8
In enacting the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , Congress comprehensively reformed thenational market for health - care products and services . By any measure , that market is immense . Collectively , Americans spent $ 2.5 trillion on health care in 2009 , accounting for 17.6 % of our Nation 's economy . 42 U. S. C. § 18091(2)(B ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) . Within the next decade , it is anticipated , spending on health care will nearly double . Ibid .	unmatched
The health - care market 's size is not its only distinctive feature . Unlike the market for almost any other product or service , the market for medical care is one in which all individuals inevitably participate . Virtually every person residing in the United States , sooner or later , will visita doctor or other health - care professional . See Dept . of Health and Human Services , National Center for Health Statistics , Summary Health Statistics for U. S. Adults : National Health Interview Survey 2009 , Ser . 10 , No . 249 , p. 124 , Table 37 ( Dec. 2010 ) ( Over 99.5 % of adults above 65 have visited a health - care professional . ) . Most people will do so repeatedly . See i d . , at 115 , Table 34 ( In 2009 alone , 64 % of adults made two or more visits to a doctor 's office . ) .	unmatched
When individuals make those visits , they face another reality of the current market for medical care : its high cost . In 2010 , on average , an individual in the United States incurred over $ 7,000 in health - care expenses . Dept . of Health and Human Services , Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , Historic National Health Expenditure Data , National Health Expenditures : Se - lected Calendar Years 1960–2010 ( Table 1 ) . Over a lifetime , costs mount to hundreds of thousands of dollars . See Alemayahu & Warner , The Lifetime Distribution of Health Care Costs , in 39 Health Service Research 627 , 635 ( June 2004 ) . When a person requires nonroutine care , the cost will generally exceed what he or she can afford to pay . A single hospital stay , for instance , typically costs upwards of $ 10,000 . See Dept . of Health and Human Services , Office of Health Policy , ASPE Research Brief : The Value of Health Insurance 5 ( May 2011 ) . Treatments for many serious , though not uncommon , conditions similarly cost a substantial sum . Brief for Economic Scholars as Amici Curiae in No . 11–398 , p. 10 ( citing a study indicating that , in 1998 , the cost of treating a heart attack for the first 90 days exceeded $ 20,000 , while the annual cost of treating certain cancers was more than $ 50,000 ) .	unmatched
Although every U. S. domiciliary will incur significant medical expenses during his or her lifetime , the time when care will be needed is often unpredictable . An accident , a heart attack , or a cancer diagnosis commonly occurs without warning . Inescapably , we are all at peril of needing medical care without a moment 's notice . See , e.g. , Campbell , Down the Insurance Rabbit Hole , N. Y. Times , Apr. 5 , 2012 , p. A23 ( telling of an uninsured 32-year - old woman who , healthy one day , became a quadriplegic the next due to an auto accident ) .	unmatched
To manage the risks associated with medical care — its high cost , its unpredictability , and its inevitability — most people in the United States obtain health insurance . Many ( approximately 170 million in 2009 ) are insured by private insurance companies . Others , including thoseover 65 and certain poor and disabled persons , rely on government - funded insurance programs , notably Medicare and Medicaid . Combined , private health insurers and State and Federal Governments finance almost 85 % of the medical care administered to U. S. residents . See Congressional Budget Office , CBO 's 2011 Long - Term Budget Outlook 37 ( June 2011 ) .	unmatched
Not all U. S. residents , however , have health insurance . In 2009 , approximately 50 million people were uninsured , either by choice or , more likely , because they could not afford private insurance and did not qualify for government aid . See Dept . of Commerce , Census Bureau , C.DeNavas - Walt , B. Proctor , & J. Smith , Income , Poverty , and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States : 2009 , p. 23 , Table 8 ( Sept. 2010 ) . As a group , uninsured individuals annually consume more than $ 100 billion in health - care services , nearly 5 % of the Nation 's total . Hidden Health Tax : Americans Pay a Premium 2 ( 2009 ) , avail - able at http://www.familiesusa.org ( all Internet mate - rial as visited June 25 , 2012 , and included in Clerk of Court 's case file ) . Over 60 % of those without insurance visit a doctor 's office or emergency room in a given year . See Dept . of Health and Human Services , National Cen - ter for Health Statistics , Health — United States—2010 , p. 282 , Table 79 ( Feb. 2011 ) .	unmatched
The large number of individuals without health insurance , Congress found , heavily burdens the national health - care market . See 42 U. S. C. § 18091(2 ) . As just noted , the cost of emergency care or treatment for a serious illness generally exceeds what an individual can afford to pay on her own . Unlike markets for most products , however , the inability to pay for care does not mean that an uninsured individual will receive no care . Federal and state law , as well as professional obligations and embedded social norms , require hospitals and physicians to provide care when it is most needed , regardless of the patient 's ability to pay . See , e.g. , 42 U. S. C. § 1395dd ; Fla. Stat . § 395.1041(3)(f ) ( 2010 ) ; Tex . Health & Safety Code Ann . § § 311.022(a ) and ( b ) ( West 2010 ) ; American Medical Association , Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs , Code of Medical Ethics , Current Opinions : Opinion 8.11—Neglect of Patient , p. 70 ( 1998–1999 ed . ) .	unmatched
As a consequence , medical - care providers deliver sig - nificant amounts of care to the uninsured for which the providers receive no payment . In 2008 , for example , hospi - tals , physicians , and other health - care professionalsreceived no compensation for $ 43 billion worth of the $ 116 billion in care they administered to those without insurance . 42 U. S. C. § 18091(2)(F ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) .	unmatched
Health - care providers do not absorb these bad debts . Instead , they raise their prices , passing along the costof uncompensated care to those who do pay reliably : the government and private insurance companies . In response , private insurers increase their premiums , shifting thecost of the elevated bills from providers onto those who carry insurance . The net result : Those with health insurance subsidize the medical care of those without it . As economists would describe what happens , the uninsured " free ride " on those who pay for health insurance .	unmatched
The size of this subsidy is considerable . Congress found that the cost - shifting just described " increases family [ insurance ] premiums by on average over $ 1,000 a year . " Ibid . Higher premiums , in turn , render health insurance less affordable , forcing more people to go without insurance and leading to further cost - shifting .	unmatched
And it is hardly just the currently sick or injured among the uninsured who prompt elevation of the price of health care and health insurance . Insurance companies and health - care providers know that some percentage of healthy , uninsured people will suffer sickness or injury each year and will receive medical care despite their inability to pay . In anticipation of this uncompensated care , health - care companies raise their prices , and insurers their premiums . In other words , because any uninsured person may need medical care at any moment and because health - care companies must account for that risk , every uninsured person impacts the market price of medical care and medical insurance .	unmatched
The failure of individuals to acquire insurance has other deleterious effects on the health - care market . Because those without insurance generally lack access to preventative care , they do not receive treatment for conditions — like hypertension and diabetes — that can be successfully and affordably treated if diagnosed early on . See Institute of Medicine , National Academies , Insuring America 's Health : Principles and Recommendations 43 ( 2004 ) . When sickness finally drives the uninsured to seek care , once treatable conditions have escalated into grave health problems , requiring more costly and extensive intervention . Id. , at 43–44 . The extra time and resources providers spend serving the uninsured lessens the providers' ability to care for those who do have insurance . See Kliff , High Uninsured Rates Can Kill You — Even if You Have Coverage , Washington Post ( May 7 , 2012 ) ( describing a study of California 's health - care market which foundthat , when hospitals divert time and resources to provide uncompensated care , the quality of care the hospitals deliver to those with insurance drops significantly ) , availa - ble at http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/high-uninsured-rates-can-kill-you-even-if-you-have-coverage/2012/05/07/gIQALNHN8T_print.html .	unmatched
States can not resolve the problem of the uninsured on their own . Like Social Security benefits , a universal health - care system , if adopted by an individual State , would be " bait to the needy and dependent elsewhere , encouraging them to migrate and seek a haven of repose . " Helvering v. Davis , 301 U. S. 619 , 644 ( 1937 ) . See also Brief for Commonwealth of Massachusetts as Amicus Curiae in No . 11–398 , p. 15 ( noting that , in 2009 , Massachusetts' emergency rooms served thousands of uninsured , out - of - state residents ) . An influx of unhealthy individuals into a State with universal health care would result in increased spending on medical services . To cover the increased costs , a State would have to raise taxes , and private health - insurance companies would have to increase premiums . Higher taxes and increased insurance costs would , in turn , encourage businesses and healthy individuals to leave the State .	unmatched
States that undertake health - care reforms on their own thus risk " placing themselves in a position of economic disadvantage as compared with neighbors or competitors . " Davis , 301 U. S. , at 644 . See also Brief for Health Care for All , Inc. , et al . as Amici Curiae in No . 11–398 , p. 4 ( " [ O]ut - of - state residents continue to seek and receive millions of dollars in uncompensated care in Massachusetts hospitals , limiting the State 's efforts to improve its health care system through the elimination of uncompensated care . " ) . Facing that risk , individual States are unlikely to take the initiative in addressing the problem of the uninsured , even though solving that problem is in all States' best interests . Congress' intervention was needed to overcome this collective- action impasse .	unmatched
Aware that a national solution was required , Congress could have taken over the health - insurance market by establishing a tax - and - spend federal program like Social Security . Such a program , commonly referred to as a single - payer system ( where the sole payer is the Federal Government ) , would have left little , if any , room for private enterprise or the States . Instead of going this route , Congress enacted the ACA , a solution that retains a robust role for private insurers and state governments . To make its chosen approach work , however , Congress had to use some new tools , including a requirement that most individuals obtain private health insurance coverage . See 26 U. S. C. § 5000A ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) ( the minimum coverage provision ) . As explained below , by employing these tools , Congress was able to achieve a practical , alto - gether reasonable , solution .	unmatched
A central aim of the ACA is to reduce the number of uninsured U. S. residents . See 42 U. S. C. § 18091(2)(C ) and ( I ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) . The minimum coverage provision advances this objective by giving potential recipients of health care a financial incentive to acquire insurance . Per the minimum coverage provision , an individual must either obtain insurance or pay a toll constructed as a tax penalty . See 26 U. S. C. § 5000A.	unmatched
The minimum coverage provision serves a further purpose vital to Congress' plan to reduce the number of uninsured . Congress knew that encouraging individuals to purchase insurance would not suffice to solve the problem , because most of the uninsured are not uninsured by choice . 1 Of particular concern to Congress were people who , though desperately in need of insurance , often can not acquire it : persons who suffer from preexisting medical conditions .	unmatched
Before the ACA 's enactment , private insurance companies took an applicant 's medical history into account when setting insurance rates or deciding whether to insure an individual . Because individuals with preexisting med - ical conditions cost insurance companies significantly more than those without such conditions , insurers routinely re - fused to insure these individuals , charged them substantially higher premiums , or offered only limited coverage that did not include the preexisting illness . See Dept . of Health and Human Services , Coverage Denied : How the Current Health Insurance System Leaves Millions Behind 1 ( 2009 ) ( Over the past three years , 12.6 million non - elderly adults were denied insurance coverage or charged higher premiums due to a preexisting condition . ) .	unmatched
To ensure that individuals with medical histories have access to affordable insurance , Congress devised a three - part solution . First , Congress imposed a " guaranteed is - sue " requirement , which bars insurers from denyingcoverage to any person on account of that person 's medical condition or history . See 42 U. S. C. § § 300gg–1 , 300gg–3 , 300gg–4(a ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) . Second , Congress required insurers to use " community rating " to price their insurance policies . See § 300gg . Community rating , in effect , bars insurance companies from charging higher premiumsto those with preexisting conditions .	unmatched
But these two provisions , Congress comprehended , could not work effectively unless individuals were given a powerful incentive to obtain insurance . See Hearings before the House Ways and Means Committee , 111th Cong . , 1st Sess . , 10 , 13 ( 2009 ) ( statement of Uwe Reinhardt ) ( " [ I]m - position of community - rated premiums and guaranteed issue on a market of competing private health insurers will inexorably drive that market into extinction , unless these two features are coupled with . . . a mandate on individual[s ] to be insured . " ( emphasis in original ) ) .	unmatched
In the 1990 's , several States — including New York , New Jersey , Washington , Kentucky , Maine , New Hampshire , and Vermont — enacted guaranteed - issue and community - rating laws without requiring universal acquisition of insurance coverage . The results were disastrous . " All seven states suffered from skyrocketing insurance pre - mium costs , reductions in individuals with coverage , and reductions in insurance products and providers . " Brief for American Association of People with Disabilities et al . as Amici Curiae in No . 11–398 , p. 9 ( hereinafter AAPD Brief ) . See also Brief for Governor of Washington Christine Gregoire as Amicus Curiae in No . 11–398 , pp . 11–14 ( describing the " death spiral " in the insurance market Washington experienced when the State passed a law requiring coverage for preexisting conditions ) .	unmatched
Congress comprehended that guaranteed - issue and community - rating laws alone will not work . When insurance companies are required to insure the sick at affordable prices , individuals can wait until they become ill to buy insurance . Pretty soon , those in need of immediate medical care — i.e . , those who cost insurers the most — become the insurance companies' main customers . This " adverse selection " problem leaves insurers with two choices : They can either raise premiums dramatically to cover their ever - increasing costs or they can exit the market . In the seven States that tried guaranteed - issue and community - rating requirements without a minimum coverage provision , that is precisely what insurance companies did . See , e.g. , AAPD Brief 10 ( " [ In Maine , ] [ m]any insurance providers doubled their premiums in just three years or less . " ) ; i d . , at 12 ( " Like New York , Vermont saw substantial increases in premiums after its . . . insurance reform measures took effect in 1993 . " ) ; Hall , An Evaluation of New York 's Reform Law , 25 J. Health Pol . Pol'y & L. 71 , 91–92 ( 2000 ) ( Guaranteed - issue and community - rating laws resulted in a " dramatic exodus of indemnity insurers from New York 's individual [ insurance ] market . " ) ; Brief for Barry Friedman et al . as Amici Curiae in No . 11–398 , p. 17 ( " In Kentucky , all but two insurers ( one State - run ) abandoned the State . " ) .	unmatched
Massachusetts , Congress was told , cracked the adverse selection problem . By requiring most residents to obtain insurance , see Mass. Gen. Laws , ch . 111 M , § 2 ( West 2011 ) , the Commonwealth ensured that insurers would not be left with only the sick as customers . As a result , federal lawmakers observed , Massachusetts succeeded where other States had failed . See Brief for Commonwealth of Massachusetts as Amicus Curiae in No . 11–398 , p. 3 ( noting that the Commonwealth 's reforms reduced the number of uninsured residents to less than 2 % , the lowest rate in the Nation , and cut the amount of uncompensated careby a third ) ; 42 U. S. C. § 18091(2)(D ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) ( noting the success of Massachusetts' reforms ) . 2 In coupling the minimum coverage provision with guaranteed - issue and community - rating prescriptions , Congressfollowed Massachusetts' lead .	unmatched
In sum , Congress passed the minimum coverage provision as a key component of the ACA to address an economic and social problem that has plagued the Nation for decades : the large number of U. S. residents who are unable or unwilling to obtain health insurance . Whatever one thinks of the policy decision Congress made , it was Congress' prerogative to make it . Reviewed with appropriate deference , the minimum coverage provision , allied to the guaranteed - issue and community - rating prescriptions , should survive measurement under the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses .	articlei#section8
The Commerce Clause , it is widely acknowledged , " was the Framers' response to the central problem that gave rise to the Constitution itself . " EEOC v. Wyoming , 460 U. S. 226 , n. 1 ( 1983 ) ( Stevens , J. , concurring ) ( citing sources ) . Under the Articles of Confederation , the Constitution 's precursor , the regulation of commerce was left to the States . This scheme proved unworkable , because the individual States , understandably focused on their own economic interests , often failed to take actions critical to the success of the Nation as a whole . See Vices of the Political System of the United States , in James Madison : Writings 69 , 71 , ¶5 ( J. Rakove ed . 1999 ) ( As a result of the " want of concert in matters where common interest requires it , " the " national dignity , interest , and reve - nue [ have ] suffered .

The Framers understood that the " general Interests of the Union " would change over time , in ways they could not anticipate . Accordingly , they recognized that the Constitution was of necessity a " great outlin[e ] , " not a detailed blueprint , see McCulloch v. Maryland , 4 Wheat . 316 , 407 ( 1819 ) , and that its provisions included broad concepts , to be " explained by the context or by the facts of the case , " Letter from James Madison to N. P. Trist ( Dec. 1831 ) , in 9 Writings of James Madison 471 , 475 ( G. Hunt ed . 1910 ) . " Nothing . . . can be more fallacious , " Alexander Hamilton emphasized , " than to infer the extent of any power , proper to be lodged in the national government , from . . . its immediate necessities .

Until today , this Court 's pragmatic approach to judging whether Congress validly exercised its commerce power was guided by two familiar principles . First , Congress has the power to regulate economic activities " that substantially affect interstate commerce . " Gonzales v. Raich , 545 U. S. 1 , 17 ( 2005 ) . This capacious power extends even to local activities that , viewed in the aggregate , have a substantial impact on interstate commerce . See ibid . See also Wickard , 317 U. S. , at 125 ( " [ E]ven if appellee 's activ - ity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce , it may still , whatever its nature , be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce . " ( emphasis added ) ) ; Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. , 301 U. S. , at 37 .	articlei#section8
Second , we owe a large measure of respect to Congress when it frames and enacts economic and social legislation . See Raich , 545 U. S. , at 17 . See also Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. R. A. Gray & Co. , 467 U. S. 717 , 729 ( 1984 ) ( " [ S]trong deference [ is ] accorded legislation in the field of national economic policy . " ) ; Hodel v. Indiana , 452 U. S. 314 , 326 ( 1981 ) ( " This [ C]ourt will certainly not substitute its judgment for that of Congress unless the relation of the subject to interstate commerce and its ef - fect upon it are clearly non - existent . " ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) . When appraising such legislation , we ask only ( 1 ) whether Congress had a " rational basis " for concluding that the regulated activity substantially affects interstate commerce , and ( 2 ) whether there is a " reasonable connection between the regulatory means selected and the asserted ends . " Id. , at 323–324 . See also Raich , 545 U. S. , at 22 ; Lopez , 514 U. S. , at 557 ; Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn . , Inc. , 452 U. S. 264 , 277 ( 1981 ) ; Katzenbach v. McClung , 379 U. S. 294 , 303 ( 1964 ) ; Heart of Atlanta Motel , Inc. v. United States , 379 U. S. 241 , 258 ( 1964 ) ; United States v. Carolene Products Co. , 304 U. S. 144–153 ( 1938 ) . In answering these questions , we presume the statute under review is constitutional and may strike it down only on a " plain showing " that Congress acted irrationally . United States v. Morrison , 529 U. S. 598 , 607 ( 2000 ) .	articlei#section8
Straightforward application of these principles would require the Court to hold that the minimum coverage provision is proper Commerce Clause legislation . Beyond dispute , Congress had a rational basis for concluding that the uninsured , as a class , substantially affect interstate commerce . Those without insurance consume billions of dollars of health - care products and services each year . See supra , at 5 . Those goods are produced , sold , and delivered largely by national and regional companies who routinely transact business across state lines . The uninsured also cross state lines to receive care . Some have medical emergencies while away from home . Others , when sick , go to a neighboring State that provides better care for those who have not prepaid for care . See supra , at 7–8 .	articlei#section8
Not only do those without insurance consume a large amount of health care each year ; critically , as earlier explained , their inability to pay for a significant portion of that consumption drives up market prices , foists costs on other consumers , and reduces market efficiency and stability . See supra , at 5–7 . Given these far - reaching effects on interstate commerce , the decision to forgo insurance is hardly inconsequential or equivalent to " doing nothing , " ante , at 20 ; it is , instead , an economic decision Congress has the authority to address under the Commerce Clause . See supra , at 14–16 . See also Wickard , 317 U. S. , at 128 ( " It is well established by decisions of this Court thatthe power to regulate commerce includes the power to regulate the prices at which commodities in that commerce are dealt in and practices affecting such prices . " ( emphasis added ) ) .	articlei#section8
The minimum coverage provision , furthermore , bears a " reasonable connection " to Congress' goal of protecting the health - care market from the disruption caused by individuals who fail to obtain insurance . By requiring those who do not carry insurance to pay a toll , the minimum coverage provision gives individuals a strong incentive to insure . This incentive , Congress had good reason to believe , would reduce the number of uninsured and , correspondingly , mitigate the adverse impact the uninsured have on the national health - care market .	unmatched
Congress also acted reasonably in requiring uninsured individuals , whether sick or healthy , either to obtain insurance or to pay the specified penalty . As earlier observed , because every person is at risk of needing care at any moment , all those who lack insurance , regardless of their current health status , adversely affect the price of health care and health insurance . See supra , at 6–7 . Moreover , an insurance - purchase requirement limited to those in need of immediate care simply could not work . Insurance companies would either charge these individuals prohibitively expensive premiums , or , if community - rating regulations were in place , close up shop . See supra , at 9–11 . See also Brief for State of Maryland and 10 Other States et al . as Amici Curiae in No . 11–398 , p. 28 ( hereinafter Maryland Brief ) ( " No insurance regime can survive if people can opt out when the risk insured against is only a risk , but opt in when the risk materializes . " ) .	unmatched
" [ W]here we find that the legislators . . . have a rational basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the protection of commerce , our investigation is at an end . " Katzenbach , 379 U. S. , at 303–304 . Congress' enactment of the minimum coverage provision , which addresses a specific interstate problem in a practical , experience - informed manner , easily meets this criterion .	unmatched
Rather than evaluating the constitutionality of the minimum coverage provision in the manner established by our precedents , The Chief Justice relies on a newly minted constitutional doctrine . The commerce power does not , The Chief Justice announces , permit Congressto " compe[l ] individuals to become active in commerceby purchasing a product . " Ante , at 20 ( emphasis deleted ) .	articlei#section8
a	unmatched
The Chief Justice 's novel constraint on Congress' commerce power gains no force from our precedent and for that reason alone warrants disapprobation . See infra , at 23–27 . But even assuming , for the moment , that Congress lacks authority under the Commerce Clause to " compel individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase an unwanted product , " ante , at 18 , such a limitation would be inapplicable here . Everyone will , at some point , consume health - care products and services . See supra , at 3 . Thus , if The Chief Justice is correct that an insurance - purchase requirement can be applied only to those who " actively " consume health care , the minimum coverage provision fits the bill .	articlei#section8
The Chief Justice does not dispute that all U. S. residents participate in the market for health services over the course of their lives . See ante , at 16 ( " Everyone will eventually need health care at a time and to an extent they can not predict . " ) . But , The Chief Justice insists , the uninsured can not be considered active in the market for health care , because " [ t]he proximity and degree of connection between the [ uninsured today ] and [ their ] subsequent commercial activity is too lacking . " Ante , at 27 .	unmatched
This argument has multiple flaws . First , more than 60 % of those without insurance visit a hospital or doctor 's office each year . See supra , at 5 . Nearly 90 % will within five years . 4 An uninsured 's consumption of health care is thus quite proximate : It is virtually certain to occur in the next five years and more likely than not to occur this year .	unmatched
Equally evident , Congress has no way of separating those uninsured individuals who will need emergency medi - cal care today ( surely their consumption of medical careis sufficiently imminent ) from those who will not need medical services for years to come . No one knows when an emergency will occur , yet emergencies involving the uninsured arise daily . To capture individuals who unexpect - edly will obtain medical care in the very near future , then , Congress needed to include individuals who will not go to a doctor anytime soon . Congress , our decisions instruct , has authority to cast its net that wide . See Perez v. United States , 402 U. S. 146 , 154 ( 1971 ) ( " [ W]hen it is necessary in order to prevent an evil to make the law embrace more than the precise thing to be prevented it may do so . " ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) . 5	unmatched
Second , it is Congress' role , not the Court 's , to delineate the boundaries of the market the Legislature seeks to regulate . The Chief Justice defines the health - care mar - ket as including only those transactions that will occur either in the next instant or within some ( unspecified ) proximity to the next instant . But Congress could reasonably have viewed the market from a long - term perspective , encompassing all transactions virtually certain to occur over the next decade , see supra , at 19 , not just those occurring here and now .	unmatched
Third , contrary to The Chief Justice 's contention , our precedent does indeed support " [ t]he proposition that Congress may dictate the conduct of an individual today because of prophesied future activity . " Ante , at 26 . In Wickard , the Court upheld a penalty the Federal Government imposed on a farmer who grew more wheat than he was permitted to grow under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 ( AAA ) . 317 U. S. , at 114–115 . He could notbe penalized , the farmer argued , as he was growing the wheat for home consumption , not for sale on the open market . Id. , at 119 . The Court rejected this argument . Id. , at 127–129 . Wheat intended for home consumption , the Court noted , " overhangs the market , and if induced by rising prices , tends to flow into the market and check price increases [ intended by the AAA ] . " Id. , at 128 .	unmatched
Similar reasoning supported the Court 's judgment in Raich , which upheld Congress' authority to regulate marijuana grown for personal use . 545 U. S. , at 19 . Homegrown marijuana substantially affects the interstate mar - ket for marijuana , we observed , for " the high demand in the interstate market will [ likely ] draw such marijuana into that market . " Ibid .	unmatched
Our decisions thus acknowledge Congress' authority , under the Commerce Clause , to direct the conduct of an individual today ( the farmer in Wickard , stopped from growing excess wheat ; the plaintiff in Raich , ordered to cease cultivating marijuana ) because of a prophesied future transaction ( the eventual sale of that wheat or marijuana in the interstate market ) . Congress' actions are even more rational in this case , where the future activity ( the consumption of medical care ) is certain to occur , the sole uncertainty being the time the activity will take place .	articlei#section8
Maintaining that the uninsured are not active in the health - care market , The Chief Justice draws an analogy to the car market . An individual " is not ‘ active in the car market,' " The Chief Justice observes , simply because he or she may someday buy a car . Ante , at 25 . The analogy is inapt . The inevitable yet unpredictable need for medical care and the guarantee that emergency care will be provided when required are conditions nonexistent in other markets . That is so of the market for cars , and of the market for broccoli as well . Although an individual might buy a car or a crown of broccoli one day , there is no certainty she will ever do so . And if she eventually wants a car or has a craving for broccoli , she will be obliged to pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nourishment . She will get no free ride or food , at the expense of another consumer forced to pay an inflated price . See Thomas More Law Center v. Obama , 651 F. 3d 529 , 565 ( CA6 2011 ) ( Sutton , J. , concurring in part ) ( " Regulating how citizens pay for what they already receive ( health care ) , never quite know when they will need , and in the case of severe illnesses or emergencies generally will not be able to afford , has few ( if any ) parallels in modern life . " ) . Upholding the minimum coverage provision on the ground that all are participants or will be participants in the health - care market would therefore carry no implication that Congress may justify under the Commerce Clause a mandate to buy other products and services .	articlei#section8
Nor is it accurate to say that the minimum coverage provision " compel[s ] individuals . . . to purchase an unwanted product , " ante , at 18 , or " suite of products , " post , at 11 , n. 2 ( joint opinion of Scalia , Kennedy , Thomas , and Alito , JJ . ) . If unwanted today , medical service secured by insurance may be desperately needed tomorrow . Virtually everyone , I reiterate , consumes health care at some point in his or her life . See supra , at 3 . Health insurance is a means of paying for this care , nothing more . In requiring individuals to obtain insurance , Congress is therefore not mandating the purchase of a discrete , unwanted product . Rather , Congress is merely defining the terms on which individuals pay for an interstate good they consume : Persons subject to the mandate must now pay for medical care in advance ( instead of at the point of service ) and through insurance ( instead of out of pocket ) . Establishing payment terms for goods in or affecting interstate commerce is quintessential economic regulation well within Congress' domain . See , e.g. , United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co. , 315 U. S. 110 , 118 ( 1942 ) . Cf . post , at 13 ( joint opinion of Scalia , Kennedy , Thomas , and Alito , JJ . ) ( recognizing that " the Federal Government can prescribe [ a commodity 's ] quality . . . and even [ its price ] " ) .	unmatched
The Chief Justice also calls the minimum coverage provision an illegitimate effort to make young , healthy individuals subsidize insurance premiums paid by the less hale and hardy . See ante , at 17 , 25–26 . This complaint , too , is spurious . Under the current health - care system , healthy persons who lack insurance receive a benefit for which they do not pay : They are assured that , if they need it , emergency medical care will be available , although they can not afford it . See supra , at 5–6 . Those who have insurance bear the cost of this guarantee . See ibid . By requiring the healthy uninsured to obtain insurance or pay a penalty structured as a tax , the minimum coverage provision ends the free ride these individuals currently enjoy .	unmatched
In the fullness of time , moreover , today 's young and healthy will become society 's old and infirm . Viewed over a lifespan , the costs and benefits even out : The young who pay more than their fair share currently will pay less than their fair share when they become senior citizens . And even if , as undoubtedly will be the case , some individuals , over their lifespans , will pay more for health insurance than they receive in health services , they have little to complain about , for that is how insurance works . Every insured person receives protection against a catastrophic loss , even though only a subset of the covered class will ultimately need that protection .	unmatched
b	unmatched
In any event , The Chief Justice 's limitation of the commerce power to the regulation of those actively engaged in commerce finds no home in the text of the Constitution or our decisions . Article I , § 8 , of the Constitution grants Congress the power " [ t]o regulate Commerce . . . among the several States . " Nothing in this language im - plies that Congress' commerce power is limited to regu - lating those actively engaged in commercial transactions . Indeed , as the D. C. Circuit observed , " [ a]t the time the Constitution was [ framed ] , to ‘ regulate' meant , " among other things , " to require action . " See Seven - Sky v. Holder , 661 F. 3d 1 , 16 ( 2011 ) .	articlei#section8
Arguing to the contrary , The Chief Justice notes that " the Constitution gives Congress the power to ‘ coinMoney,' in addition to the power to ‘ regulate the Value thereof,' " and similarly " gives Congress the power to ‘ raise and support Armies' and to ‘ provide and maintain a Navy,' in addition to the power to ‘ make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.' " Ante , at 18–19 ( citing Art . I , § 8 , cls . 5 , 12–14 ) . In separating the power to regulate from the power to bring the subject of the regulation into existence , The Chief Justice asserts , " [ t]he language of the Constitution reflects the natural understanding that the power to regulate assumes there is already something to be regulated . " Ante , at 19 .	articlei#section8
This argument is difficult to fathom . Requiring individuals to obtain insurance unquestionably regulates the inter - state health - insurance and health - care markets , both of them in existence well before the enactment of the ACA . See Wickard , 317 U. S. , at 128 ( " The stimulation of commerce is a use of the regulatory function quite as definitely as prohibitions or restrictions thereon . " ) . Thus , the " something to be regulated " was surely there when Congress created the minimum coverage provision . 6	articlei#section8
Nor does our case law toe the activity versus inactiv - ity line . In Wickard , for example , we upheld the penalty imposed on a farmer who grew too much wheat , even though the regulation had the effect of compelling farmers to purchase wheat in the open market . Id. , at 127–129 . " [ F]orcing some farmers into the market to buy what they could provide for themselves " was , the Court held , a valid means of regulating commerce . Id. , at 128–129 . In an - other context , this Court similarly upheld Congress' authority under the commerce power to compel an " inactive " land - holder to submit to an unwanted sale . See Monongahela Nav . Co. v. United States , 148 U. S. 312–337 ( 1893 ) ( " [ U]pon the [ great ] power to regulate commerce [ , ] " Congress has the authority to mandate the sale of real prop - erty to the Government , where the sale is essential to the improvement of a navigable waterway ( emphasis added ) ) ; Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co. , 135 U. S. 641 , 657–659 ( 1890 ) ( similar reliance on the commerce power regarding mandated sale of private property for railroad construction ) .	articlei#section8
In concluding that the Commerce Clause does not permit Congress to regulate commercial " inactivity , " and there - fore does not allow Congress to adopt the practical solution it devised for the health - care problem , The Chief Justice views the Clause as a " technical legal conception , " precisely what our case law tells us not to do . Wickard , 317 U. S. , at 122 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . See also supra , at 14–16 . This Court 's former endeavors to impose categorical limits on the commerce power have not fared well . In several pre - New Deal cases , the Court attempted to cabin Congress' Commerce Clause authority by distinguishing " commerce " from activity once conceived to be noncommercial , notably , " production , " " mining , " and " manufacturing . " See , e.g. , United States v. E. C. Knight Co. , 156 U. S. 1 , 12 ( 1895 ) ( " Commerce succeeds to manufacture , and is not a part of it . " ) ; Carter v. Carter Coal Co. , 298 U. S. 238 , 304 ( 1936 ) ( " Mining brings the subject matter of commerce into existence . Commerce disposes of it . " ) . The Court also sought to distinguish activities having a " direct " effect on interstate commerce , and for that reason , subject to federal regulation , from those having only an " indirect " effect , and therefore not amenable to federal control . See , e.g. , A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States , 295 U. S. 495 , 548 ( 1935 ) ( " [ T]he dis - tinction between direct and indirect effects of intrastate transactions upon interstate commerce must be recognized as a fundamental one . " ) .	articlei#section8
These line - drawing exercises were untenable , and the Court long ago abandoned them . " [ Q]uestions of the power of Congress [ under the Commerce Clause ] , " we held in Wickard , " are not to be decided by reference to any for - mula which would give controlling force to nomenclature such as ‘ production' and ‘ indirect' and foreclose consideration of the actual effects of the activity in question upon interstate commerce . " 317 U. S. , at 120 . See also Morrison , 529 U. S. , at 641–644 ( Souter , J. , dissenting ) ( recounting the Court 's " nearly disastrous experiment " with formalistic limits on Congress' commerce power ) . Failing to learn from this history , The Chief Justice plows ahead with his formalistic distinction between those who are " active in commerce , " ante , at 20 , and those who are not .	articlei#section8
It is not hard to show the difficulty courts ( and Congress ) would encounter in distinguishing statutes that reg - ulate " activity " from those that regulate " inactivity . " As Judge Easterbrook noted , " it is possible to restate most actions as corresponding inactions with the same effect . " Archie v. Racine , 847 F. 2d 1211 , 1213 ( CA7 1988 ) ( en banc ) . Take this case as an example . An individual who opts not to purchase insurance from a private insurer can be seen as actively selecting another form of insurance : self - insurance . See Thomas More Law Center , 651 F. 3d , at 561 ( Sutton , J. , concurring in part ) ( " No one is in - active when deciding how to pay for health care , as self - insurance and private insurance are two forms of action for addressing the same risk . " ) . The minimum coverage provision could therefore be described as regulating activists in the self - insurance market . 7 Wickard is another example . Did the statute there at issue target activity ( the growing of too much wheat ) or inactivity ( the farmer 's failure to purchase wheat in the marketplace ) ? If anything , the Court 's analysis suggested the latter . See 317 U. S. , at 127–129 .	unmatched
At bottom , The Chief Justice 's and the joint dissenters' " view that an individual can not be subject to Commerce Clause regulation absent voluntary , affirmative acts that enter him or her into , or affect , the interstate mar - ket expresses a concern for individual liberty that [ is ] more redolent of Due Process Clause arguments . " Seven - Sky , 661 F. 3d , at 19 . See also Troxel v. Granville , 530 U. S. 57 , 65 ( 2000 ) ( plurality opinion ) ( " The [ Due Process ] Clause also includes a substantive component that provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests . " ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) . Plaintiffs have abandoned any argument pinned to substantive due process , however , see 648 F. 3d 1235 , 1291 , n. 93 ( CA11 2011 ) , and now concede that the provisions here at issue do not offend the Due Process Clause . 8	articlei#section8,amendmentxiv
Underlying The Chief Justice 's view that the Commerce Clause must be confined to the regulation of active participants in a commercial market is a fear that the commerce power would otherwise know no limits . See , e.g. , ante , at 23 ( Allowing Congress to compel an individ - ual not engaged in commerce to purchase a product would " permi[t ] Congress to reach beyond the natural extentof its authority , everywhere extending the sphere of its activity , and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex . " ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) . The joint dissenters express a similar apprehension . See post , at 8 ( If the minimum coverage provision is upheld under the commerce power then " the Commerce Clause becomes a font of unlimited power , . . . the hideous monster whose devouring jaws . . . spare neither sex nor age , nor high nor low , nor sacred nor profane . " ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) . This concern is unfounded .	articlei#section8
First , The Chief Justice could certainly uphold the individual mandate without giving Congress carte blanche to enact any and all purchase mandates . As several times noted , the unique attributes of the health - care market render everyone active in that market and give rise to a significant free - riding problem that does not occur in other markets . See supra , at 3–7 , 16–18 , 21 .	unmatched
Nor would the commerce power be unbridled , absent The Chief Justice 's " activity " limitation . Congress wouldremain unable to regulate noneconomic conduct that has only an attenuated effect on interstate commerce and is traditionally left to state law . See Lopez , 514 U. S. , at567 ; Morrison , 529 U. S. , at 617–619 . In Lopez , forexample , the Court held that the Federal Government lacked power , under the Commerce Clause , to criminalize the possession of a gun in a local school zone . Possessinga gun near a school , the Court reasoned , " is in no sensean economic activity that might , through repetition elsewhere , substantially affect any sort of interstate commerce . " 514 U. S. , at 567 ; ibid . ( noting that the Court would have " to pile inference upon inference " to conclude that gun possession has a substantial effect on commerce ) . Relying on similar logic , the Court concluded in Morrison that Congress could not regulate gender - motivated violence , which the Court deemed to have too " attenuated [ an ] effect upon interstate commerce . " 529 U. S. , at 615 .	articlei#section8
An individual 's decision to self - insure , I have explained , is an economic act with the requisite connection to interstate commerce . See supra , at 16–17 . Other choices individuals make are unlikely to fit the same or similar description . As an example of the type of regulation he fears , The Chief Justice cites a Government mandate to purchase green vegetables . Ante , at 22–23 . One could call this concern " the broccoli horrible . " Congress , The Chief Justice posits , might adopt such a mandate , reasoning that an individual 's failure to eat a healthy diet , like the failure to purchase health insurance , imposes costs on others . See ibid .	articlei#section8
Consider the chain of inferences the Court would have to accept to conclude that a vegetable - purchase mandate was likely to have a substantial effect on the health - care costs borne by lithe Americans . The Court would have to believe that individuals forced to buy vegetables would then eat them ( instead of throwing or giving them away ) , would prepare the vegetables in a healthy way ( steamed or raw , not deep - fried ) , would cut back on unhealthy foods , and would not allow other factors ( such as lack of exercise or little sleep ) to trump the improved diet . 9 Such " pil[ing of ] inference upon inference " is just what the Court refused to do in Lopez and Morrison .	unmatched
Other provisions of the Constitution also check congressional overreaching . A mandate to purchase a particu - lar product would be unconstitutional if , for example , the edict impermissibly abridged the freedom of speech , interfered with the free exercise of religion , or infringed on a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause .	first_amendment,amendmentxiv
Supplementing these legal restraints is a formidable check on congressional power : the democratic process . See Raich , 545 U. S. , at 33 ; Wickard , 317 U. S. , at 120 ( repeating Chief Justice Marshall 's " warning that effective restraints on [ the commerce power 's ] exercise must proceed from political rather than judicial processes " ( citing Gibbons v. Ogden , 9 Wheat . 1 , 197 ( 1824 ) ) . As the controversy surrounding the passage of the Affordable Care Act attests , purchase mandates are likely to engender political resistance . This prospect is borne out by the behavior of state legislators . Despite their possession of unquestioned authority to impose mandates , state governments have rarely done so . See Hall , Commerce Clause Challenges to Health Care Reform , 159 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1825 , 1838 ( 2011 ) .	articlei#section8
When contemplated in its extreme , almost any power looks dangerous . The commerce power , hypothetically , would enable Congress to prohibit the purchase and home production of all meat , fish , and dairy goods , effectively compelling Americans to eat only vegetables . Cf . Raich , 545 U. S. , at 9 ; Wickard , 317 U. S. , at 127–129 . Yet no one would offer the " hypothetical and unreal possibilit[y ] , " Pullman Co. v. Knott , 235 U. S. 23 , 26 ( 1914 ) , of a vegetarian state as a credible reason to deny Congress the authority ever to ban the possession and sale of goods . The Chief Justice accepts just such specious logic when he cites the broccoli horrible as a reason to deny Congressthe power to pass the individual mandate . Cf . R. Bork , The Tempting of America 169 ( 1990 ) ( " Judges and lawyers live on the slippery slope of analogies ; they are not supposed to ski it to the bottom . " ) . But see , e.g. , post , at 3 ( joint opinion of Scalia , Kennedy , Thomas , and Alito , JJ . ) ( asserting , outlandishly , that if the minimum coverage provision is sustained , then Congress could make " breathing in and out the basis for federal prescription " ) .	articlei#section8

To bolster his argument that the minimum coverage provision is not valid Commerce Clause legislation , The Chief Justice emphasizes the provision 's novelty . See ante , at 18 ( asserting that " sometimes the most telling indication of [ a ] severe constitutional problem . . . is the lack of historical precedent for Congress 's action " ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) . While an insurance - purchase mandate may be novel , The Chief Justice 's argument certainly is not . " [ I]n almost every instance of the exer - cise of the [ commerce ] power differences are asserted from previous exercises of it and made a ground of attack . " Hoke v. United States , 227 U. S. 308 , 320 ( 1913 ) . See , e.g. , Brief for Petitioner in Perez v. United States , O. T. 1970 , No . 600 , p. 5 ( " unprecedented exercise of power " ) ; Sup - plemental Brief for Appellees in Katzenbach v. McClung , O. T. 1964 , No . 543 , p. 40 ( " novel assertion of federal power " ) ; Brief for Appellee in Wickard v. Filburn , O. T. 1941 , No . 59 , p. 6 ( " complete departure " ) . For decades , the Court has declined to override legislation because of its novelty , and for good reason . As our national economy grows and changes , we have recognized , Congress must adapt to the changing " economic and financial realities . " See supra , at 14–15 . Hindering Congress' ability to do so is shortsighted ; if history is any guide , today 's constriction of the Commerce Clause will not endure . See supra , at 25–26 .	articlei#section8
For the reasons explained above , the minimum coverage provision is valid Commerce Clause legislation . See supra , Part II . When viewed as a component of the entire ACA , the provision 's constitutionality becomes even plainer .	articlei#section8
The Necessary and Proper Clause " empowers Congress to enact laws in effectuation of its [ commerce ] powe[r]that are not within its authority to enact in isolation . " Raich , 545 U. S. , at 39 ( Scalia , J. , concurring in judgment ) . Hence , " [ a ] complex regulatory program . . . can survive a Commerce Clause challenge without a showing that every single facet of the program is independently and directly related to a valid congressional goal . " Indiana , 452 U. S. , at 329 , n. 17 . " It is enough that the challenged provisions are an integral part of the regulatory program and that the regulatory scheme when considered as a whole satisfies this test . " Ibid . ( collecting cases ) . See also Raich,545 U. S. , at 24–25 ( A challenged statutory provisionfits within Congress' commerce authority if it is an " essential par[t ] of a larger regulation of economic activity,"such that , in the absence of the provision , " the regulatory scheme could be undercut . " ( quoting Lopez , 514 U. S. , at 561 ) ) ; Raich , 545 U. S. , at 37 ( Scalia , J. , concurring in judgment ) ( " Congress may regulate even noneconomic local activity if that regulation is a necessary part ofa more general regulation of interstate commerce . The relevant question is simply whether the means chosen are ‘ reasonably adapted' to the attainment of a legitimate end under the commerce power . " ( citation omitted ) ) .	articlei#section8
Recall that one of Congress' goals in enacting the Affordable Care Act was to eliminate the insurance industry 's practice of charging higher prices or denying coverage to individuals with preexisting medical conditions . See supra , at 9–10 . The commerce power allows Congress to ban this practice , a point no one disputes . See United States v. South - Eastern Underwriters Assn . , 322 U. S. 533–553 ( 1944 ) ( Congress may regulate " the methods by which interstate insurance companies do business . " ) .	articlei#section8
Congress knew , however , that simply barring insurance companies from relying on an applicant 's medical history would not work in practice . Without the individual mandate , Congress learned , guaranteed - issue and community - rating requirements would trigger an adverse - selection death - spiral in the health - insurance market : Insurance premiums would skyrocket , the number of uninsured would increase , and insurance companies would exit the market . See supra , at 10–11 . When complemented by an insurance mandate , on the other hand , guaranteed issue and community rating would work as intended , increasing access to insurance and reducing uncompensated care . See supra , at 11–12 . The minimum coverage provision is thus an " essential par[t ] of a larger regulation of economic activity " ; without the provision , " the regulatory scheme [ w]ould be undercut . " Raich , 545 U. S. , at 24–25 ( inter - nal quotation marks omitted ) . Put differently , the minimum coverage provision , together with the guaranteed - issue and community - rating requirements , is " ‘ reasonably adapted' to the attainment of a legitimate end underthe commerce power " : the elimination of pricing andsales practices that take an applicant 's medical history into account . See i d . , at 37 ( Scalia , J. , concurring in judgment ) .	articlei#section8
Asserting that the Necessary and Proper Clause does not authorize the minimum coverage provision , The Chief Justice focuses on the word " proper . " A mandate to purchase health insurance is not " proper " legislation , The Chief Justice urges , because the command " undermine[s ] the structure of government established by the Constitution . " Ante , at 28 . If long on rhetoric , The Chief Justice 's argument is short on substance .	articlei#section8
The Chief Justice cites only two cases in which this Court concluded that a federal statute impermissibly transgressed the Constitution 's boundary between state and federal authority : Printz v. United States , 521 U. S. 898 ( 1997 ) , and New York v. United States , 505 U. S.144 ( 1992 ) . See ante , at 29 . The statutes at issue inboth cases , however , compelled state officials to act on the Federal Government 's behalf . 521 U. S. , at 925–933 ( holding unconstitutional a statute obligating state law enforcement officers to implement a federal gun - control law ) ; New York , 505 U. S. , at 176–177 ( striking down a statute requiring state legislators to pass regulations pursuant to Congress' instructions ) . " [ Federal ] laws conscripting state officers , " the Court reasoned , " violate state sovereignty and are thus not in accord with the Constitution . " Printz , 521 U. S. , at 925 , 935 ; New York , 505 U. S. , at 176 .	unmatched
The minimum coverage provision , in contrast , acts " directly upon individuals , without employing the States as intermediaries . " New York , 505 U. S. , at 164 . The provision is thus entirely consistent with the Consti - tution 's design . See Printz , 521 U. S. , at 920 ( " [ T]he Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers upon Congress the power to regulate individuals , not States . " ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) .	unmatched
Lacking case law support for his holding , The Chief Justice nevertheless declares the minimum coverage provision not " proper " because it is less " narrow in scope " than other laws this Court has upheld under the Necessary and Proper Clause . Ante , at 29 ( citing United States v. Comstock , 560 U. S. _ _ _ ( 2010 ) ; Sabri v. United States , 541 U. S. 600 ( 2004 ) ; Jinks v. Richland County , 538 U. S. 456 ( 2003 ) ) . The Chief Justice 's reliance on cases in which this Court has affirmed Congress' " broad authority to enact federal legislation " under the Necessary and Proper Clause , Comstock , 560 U. S. , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 5 ) , is underwhelming .	articlei#section8
Nor does The Chief Justice pause to explain why the power to direct either the purchase of health insurance or , alternatively , the payment of a penalty collectible as a tax is more far - reaching than other implied powers this Court has found meet under the Necessary and Proper Clause . These powers include the power to enact criminal laws , see , e.g. , United States v. Fox , 95 U. S. 670 , 672 ( 1878 ) ; the power to imprison , including civil imprisonment , see , e.g. , Comstock , 560 U. S. , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 1 ) ; and the power to create a national bank , see McCulloch , 4 Wheat . , at 425 . See also Jinks , 538 U. S. , at 463 ( affirming Congress' power to alter the way a state law is applied in state court , where the alteration " promotes fair and efficient operation of the federal courts " ) . 10	articlei#section8
In failing to explain why the individual mandate threatens our constitutional order , The Chief Justice disserves future courts . How is a judge to decide , when ruling on the constitutionality of a federal statute , whether Congress employed an " independent power , " ante , at 28 , or merely a " derivative " one , ante , at 29 . Whether the power used is " substantive , " ante , at 30 , or just " incidental , " ante , at 29 ? The instruction The Chief Justice , in effect , provides lower courts : You will know it when you see it .	unmatched
It is more than exaggeration to suggest that the minimum coverage provision improperly intrudes on " essential attributes of state sovereignty . " Ibid . ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . First , the Affordable Care Act does not operate " in [ an ] are[a ] such as criminal law enforcement or education where States historically have been sovereign . " Lopez , 514 U. S. , at 564 . As evidenced by Medicare , Medicaid , the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ) , and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) , the Federal Government plays a lead role in the health - care sector , both as a direct payer and as a regulator .	unmatched
Second , and perhaps most important , the minimum coverage provision , along with other provisions of the ACA , addresses the very sort of interstate problem that made the commerce power essential in our federal system . See supra , at 12–14 . The crisis created by the large number of U. S. residents who lack health insurance is one of national dimension that States are " separately incompetent " to handle . See supra , at 7–8 , 13 . See also Maryland Brief 15–26 ( describing " the impediments to effective state policymaking that flow from the interconnectedness of each state 's healthcare economy " and emphasizing that " state - level reforms can not fully address the problems associated with uncompensated care " ) . Far from trampling on States' sovereignty , the ACA attempts a federal solution for the very reason that the States , acting separately , can not meet the need . Notably , the ACA serves the general welfare of the people of the United States while retaining a prominent role for the States . See i d . , at 31–36 ( explaining and illustrating how the ACA affords States wide latitude in implementing key elements of the Act 's reforms ) . 11	articlei#section8
In the early 20th century , this Court regularly struck down economic regulation enacted by the peoples' representatives in both the States and the Federal Government . See , e.g. , Carter Coal Co. , 298 U. S. , at 303–304 , 309–310 ; Dagenhart , 247 U. S. , at 276–277 ; Lochner v. New York , 198 U. S. 45 , 64 ( 1905 ) . The Chief Justice 's Commerce Clause opinion , and even more so the joint dissenters' reasoning , see post , at 4–16 , bear a disquieting resemblance to those long - overruled decisions .	articlei#section8
Ultimately , the Court upholds the individual mandate as a proper exercise of Congress' power to tax and spend " for the . . . general Welfare of the United States . " Art . I , § 8 , cl . 1 ; ante , at 43–44 . I concur in that determination , which makes The Chief Justice 's Commerce Clause essay all the more puzzling . Why should The Chief Justice strive so mightily to hem in Congress' capacity to meet the new problems arising constantly in our ever - developing modern economy ? I find no satisfying response to that question in his opinion . 12	articlei#section8

Through Medicaid , Congress has offered the States an opportunity to furnish health care to the poor with the aid of federal financing . To receive federal Medicaid funds , States must provide health benefits to specified categories of needy persons , including pregnant women , children , parents , and adults with disabilities . Guaranteed eligibility varies by category : for some it is tied to the federal poverty level ( incomes up to 100 % or 133 % ) ; for others it depends on criteria such as eligibility for designated state or federal assistance programs . The ACA enlarges the population of needy people States must cover to include adults under age 65 with incomes up to 133 % of the fed - eral poverty level . The spending power conferred by the Constitution , the Court has never doubted , permits Congress to define the contours of programs financed with federal funds . See , e.g. , Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman , 451 U. S. 1 , 17 ( 1981 ) . And to expand coverage , Congress could have recalled the existing legislation , and replaced it with a new law making Medicaid as embracive of the poor as Congress chose .	articlei#section8
The question posed by the 2010 Medicaid expansion , then , is essentially this : To cover a notably larger population , must Congress take the repeal / reenact route , or may it achieve the same result by amending existing law ? The answer should be that Congress may expand by amendment the classes of needy persons entitled to Medicaid benefits . A ritualistic requirement that Congress repeal and reenact spending legislation in order to enlarge the population served by a federally funded program would advance no constitutional principle and would scarcely serve the interests of federalism . To the contrary , such a requirement would rigidify Congress' efforts to empower States by partnering with them in the implementation of federal programs .	unmatched
Medicaid is a prototypical example of federal - state cooperation in serving the Nation 's general welfare . Rather than authorizing a federal agency to administer a uni - form national health - care system for the poor , Con - gress offered States the opportunity to tailor Medicaid grants to their particular needs , so long as they remain within bounds set by federal law . In shaping Medicaid , Congress did not endeavor to fix permanently the terms participating states must meet ; instead , Congress reserved the " right to alter , amend , or repeal " any provision of the Medicaid Act . 42 U. S. C. § 1304 . States , for their part , agreed to amend their own Medicaid plans consistent with changes from time to time made in the federal law . See 42 CFR § 430.12(c)(i ) ( 2011 ) . And from 1965 to the present , States have regularly conformed to Congress' alterations of the Medicaid Act .	unmatched
The Chief Justice acknowledges that Congress may " condition the receipt of [ federal ] funds on the States' complying with restrictions on the use of those funds , " ante , at 50 , but nevertheless concludes that the 2010 expansion is unduly coercive . His conclusion rests on three premises , each of them essential to his theory . First , the Medicaid expansion is , in The Chief Justice 's view , a new grant program , not an addition to the Medicaid program existing before the ACA 's enactment . Congress , The Chief Justice maintains , has threatened States with the loss of funds from an old program in an effort to get them to adopt a new one . Second , the expansion was unforeseeable by the States when they first signed on to Medicaid . Third , the threatened loss of funding is so large that the States have no real choice but to participate in the Medicaid expansion . The Chief Justice therefore — for the first time ever — finds an exercise of Congress' spending power unconstitutionally coercive .	articlei#section8
Medicaid , as amended by the ACA , however , is not two spending programs ; it is a single program with a constant aim — to enable poor persons to receive basic health care when they need it . Given past expansions , plus express statutory warning that Congress may change the requirements participating States must meet , there can be no tenable claim that the ACA fails for lack of notice . Moreover , States have no entitlement to receive any Medicaid funds ; they enjoy only the opportunity to accept funds on Congress' terms . Future Congresses are not boundby their predecessors' dispositions ; they have authority to spend federal revenue as they see fit . The Federal Government , therefore , is not , as The Chief Justice charges , threatening States with the loss of " existing " funds from one spending program in order to induce them to opt into another program . Congress is simply requiring States to do what States have long been required to do to receive Medicaid funding : comply with the conditions Congress prescribes for participation .	unmatched
A majority of the Court , however , buys the argument that prospective withholding of funds formerly available exceeds Congress' spending power . Given that holding , I entirely agree with The Chief Justice as to the appropriate remedy . It is to bar the withholding found impermissible — not , as the joint dissenters would have it , to scrap the expansion altogether , see post , at 46–48 . The dissenters' view that the ACA must fall in its entirety is a radical departure from the Court 's normal course . When a constitutional infirmity mars a statute , the Court ordinarily removes the infirmity . It undertakes a salvage operation ; it does not demolish the legislation . See , e.g. , Brockett v. Spokane Arcades , Inc. , 472 U. S. 491 , 504 ( 1985 ) ( Court 's normal course is to declare a statute invalid " to the extent that it reaches too far , but otherwise [ to leave the statute ] intact " ) . That course is plainly in order where , as in this case , Congress has expressly instructed courts to leave untouched every provision not found invalid . See 42 U. S. C. § 1303 . Because The Chief Justice finds the withholding — not the granting — of federal funds incom - patible with the Spending Clause , Congress' extension of Medicaid remains available to any State that affirms its willingness to participate .	articlei#section8
Expansion has been characteristic of the Medicaid program . Akin to the ACA in 2010 , the Medicaid Act as passed in 1965 augmented existing federal grant programs jointly administered with the States . 13 States were not required to participate in Medicaid . But if they did , the Federal Government paid at least half the costs . To qual - ify for these grants , States had to offer a minimum level of health coverage to beneficiaries of four federally funded , state - administered welfare programs : Aid to Families with Dependent Children ; Old Age Assistance ; Aid to the Blind ; and Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled . See Social Security Amendments of 1965 , § 121(a ) , 79Stat . 343 ; Schweiker v. Gray Panthers , 453 U. S. 34 , 37 ( 1981 ) . At their option , States could enroll additional " medically needy " individuals ; these costs , too , were partially borne by the Federal Government at the same , at least 50 % , rate . Ibid .	unmatched
Since 1965 , Congress has amended the Medicaid program on more than 50 occasions , sometimes quite sizably . Most relevant here , between 1988 and 1990 , Congress required participating States to include among their beneficiaries pregnant women with family incomes up to 133 % of the federal poverty level , children up to age 6 at the same income levels , and children ages 6 to 18 with family incomes up to 100 % of the poverty level . See 42 U. S. C. § § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i ) , 1396a(l ) ; Medicare Catastrophic Cov - erage Act of 1988 , § 302 , 102Stat . 750 ; Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 , § 6401 , 103Stat . 2258 ; Om - nibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 , § 4601 , 104Stat . 1388–166 . These amendments added millions to the Medicaid - eligible population . Dubay & Kenney , Lessons from the Medicaid Expansions for Children and Pregnant Women 5 ( Apr. 1997 ) .	unmatched
Between 1966 and 1990 , annual federal Medicaid spending grew from $ 631.6 million to $ 42.6 billion ; statespending rose to $ 31 billion over the same period . See Dept . of Health and Human Services , National Health Expenditures by Type of Service and Source of Funds : Calendar Years 1960 to 2010 ( table ) . 14 And between 1990 and 2010 , federal spending increased to $ 269.5 billion . Ibid . Enlargement of the population and services covered by Medicaid , in short , has been the trend .	unmatched
Compared to past alterations , the ACA is notable for the extent to which the Federal Government will pick up the tab . Medicaid 's 2010 expansion is financed largely by federal outlays . In 2014 , federal funds will cover 100%of the costs for newly eligible beneficiaries ; that rate will gradually decrease before settling at 90 % in 2020 . 42 U. S. C. § 1396d(y ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) . By comparison , federal contributions toward the care of beneficiaries eligible pre - ACA range from 50 % to 83 % , and averaged 57 % between 2005 and 2008 . § 1396d(b ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) ; Dept . of Health and Human Services , Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , C. Truffer et al . , 2010 Actuarial Report on the Financial Outlook for Medicaid , p. 20 .	unmatched
Nor will the expansion exorbitantly increase state Medicaid spending . The Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) projects that States will spend 0.8 % more than they would have , absent the ACA . See CBO , Spending & Enrollment Detail for CBO 's March 2009 Baseline . But see ante , at 44–45 ( " [ T]he Act dramatically increases state obligations under Medicaid . " ) ; post , at 45 ( joint opinion of Scalia , Kennedy , Thomas , and Alito , JJ . ) ( " [ A]cceptance of the [ ACA expansion ] will impose very substantial costs on participating States . " ) . Whatever the increase in state obligations after the ACA , it will pale in comparison to the increase in federal funding . 15	unmatched
Finally , any fair appraisal of Medicaid would require acknowledgment of the considerable autonomy States enjoy under the Act . Far from " conscript[ing ] state agencies into the national bureaucratic army , " ante , at 55 ( citing FERC v. Mississippi , 456 U. S. 742 , 775 ( 1982 ) ( O'Connor , J. , concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part ) ( brackets in original and internal quotation marks omitted ) ) , Medicaid " is designed to advance cooperative federalism . " Wisconsin Dept . of Health and Family Servs . v. Blumer , 534 U. S. 473 , 495 ( 2002 ) ( citing Harris v. McRae , 448 U. S. 297 , 308 ( 1980 ) ) . Subject to its basic requirements , the Medicaid Act empowers States to " select dramatically different levels of funding and coverage , alter and experiment with different financing and delivery modes , and opt to cover ( or not to cover ) a range of parti - cular procedures and therapies . States have leveraged this policy discretion to generate a myriad of dramatically different Medicaid programs over the past several decades . " Ruger , Of Icebergs and Glaciers , 75 Law & Contemp . Probs . 215 , 233 ( 2012 ) ( footnote omitted ) . The ACA does not jettison this approach . States , as first - line administrators , will continue to guide the distribution of substantial resources among their needy populations .	unmatched
The alternative to conditional federal spending , it bears emphasis , is not state autonomy but state marginalization . 16 In 1965 , Congress elected to nationalize health coverage for seniors through Medicare . It could similarly have established Medicaid as an exclusively federal program . Instead , Congress gave the States the opportunity to partner in the program 's administration and development . Absent from the nationalized model , of course , is the state - level policy discretion and experimentation that is Medicaid 's hallmark ; undoubtedly the interests of federalism are better served when States retain a meaning - ful role in the implementation of a program of suchimportance . See Caminker , State Sovereignty and Sub - ordinacy , 95 Colum . L. Rev. 1001 , 1002–1003 ( 1995 ) ( coopera - tive federalism can preserve " a significant role for state discretion in achieving specified federal goals , where the alternative is complete federal preemption of any state regulatory role " ) ; Rose - Ackerman , Cooperative Federalism and Co - optation , 92 Yale L. J. 1344 , 1346 ( 1983 ) ( " Ifthe federal government begins to take full responsibility for social welfare spending and preempts the states , the result is likely to be weaker . . . state governments .

Although Congress " has no obligation to use its Spending Clause power to disburse funds to the States , " College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed . Expense Bd . , 527 U. S. 666 , 686 ( 1999 ) , it has provided Medicaid grants notable for their generosity and flexibility . " [ S]uch funds , " we once observed , " are gifts , " i d . , at 686–687 , and so they have remained through decades of expansion in their size and scope .	articlei#section8
The Spending Clause authorizes Congress " to pay the Debts and provide for the . . . general Welfare of theUnited States . " Art . I , § 8 , cl . 1 . To ensure that federal funds granted to the States are spent " to ‘ provide for the . . . general Welfare' in the manner Congress intended , " ante , at 46 , Congress must of course have authority to impose limitations on the States' use of the federal dollars . This Court , time and again , has respected Congress' prescription of spending conditions , and has required States to abide by them . See , e.g. , Pennhurst , 451 U. S. , at 17 ( " [ O]ur cases have long recognized that Congress may fix the terms on which it shall disburse federal money to the States . " ) . In particular , we have recognized Congress' prerogative to condition a State 's receipt of Medicaid funding on compliance with the terms Congress set for participation in the program . See , e.g. , Harris , 448 U. S. , at 301 ( " [ O]nce a State elects to participate [ in Medicaid ] , it must comply with the requirements of [ the Medicaid Act ] . " ) ; Arkansas Dept . of Health and Human Servs . v. Ahlborn , 547 U. S. 268 , 275 ( 2006 ) ; Frew v. Hawkins , 540 U. S. 431 , 433 ( 2004 ) ; Atkins v. Rivera , 477 U. S. 154–157 ( 1986 ) .	articlei#section8
Congress' authority to condition the use of federal funds is not confined to spending programs as first launched . The legislature may , and often does , amend the law , imposing new conditions grant recipients henceforth must meet in order to continue receiving funds . See infra , at 54 ( describing Bennett v. Kentucky Dept . of Ed . , 470 U. S. 656–660 ( 1985 ) ( enforcing restriction added five years after adoption of educational program ) ) .	unmatched
Yes , there are federalism - based limits on the use of Congress' conditional spending power . In the leading decision in this area , South Dakota v. Dole , 483 U. S. 203 ( 1987 ) , the Court identified four criteria . The conditions placed on federal grants to States must ( a ) promote the " general welfare , " ( b ) " unambiguously " inform States what is demanded of them , ( c ) be germane " to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs , " and ( d ) not " induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional . " Id. , at 207–208 , 210 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . 18	unmatched
The Court in Dole mentioned , but did not adopt , a further limitation , one hypothetically raised a half - century earlier : In " some circumstances , " Congress might be prohibited from offering a " financial inducement . . . so coercive as to pass the point at which ‘ pressure turns into compulsion.' " Id. , at 211 ( quoting Steward Machine Co. v. Davis , 301 U. S. 548 , 590 ( 1937 ) ) . Prior to today 's decision , however , the Court has never ruled that the terms of any grant crossed the indistinct line between temptation and coercion .	unmatched
Dole involved the National Minimum Drinking Age Act , 23 U. S. C. § 158 , enacted in 1984 . That Act directed the Secretary of Transportation to withhold 5 % of the federal highway funds otherwise payable to a State if the State permitted purchase of alcoholic beverages by personsless than 21 years old . Drinking age was not within the authority of Congress to regulate , South Dakota argued , because the Twenty - First Amendment gave the States exclusive power to control the manufacture , transportation , and consumption of alcoholic beverages . The small percentage of highway - construction funds South Dakota stood to lose by adhering to 19 as the age of eligibility to purchase 3.2 % beer , however , was not enough to qualify as coercion , the Court concluded .	amendmentxxi
This case does not present the concerns that led the Court in Dole even to consider the prospect of coercion . In Dole , the condition — set 21 as the minimum drinking age — did not tell the States how to use funds Congress pro - vided for highway construction . Further , in view of the Twenty - First Amendment , it was an open question whether Congress could directly impose a national minimumdrinking age .	amendmentxxi
The ACA , in contrast , relates solely to the federally funded Medicaid program ; if States choose not to comply , Congress has not threatened to withhold funds earmarked for any other program . Nor does the ACA use Medicaid funding to induce States to take action Congress itself could not undertake . The Federal Government undoubtedly could operate its own health - care program for poor persons , just as it operates Medicare for seniors' health care . See supra , at 44 .	unmatched
That is what makes this such a simple case , and the Court 's decision so unsettling . Congress , aiming to assist the needy , has appropriated federal money to subsidize state health - insurance programs that meet federal standards . The principal standard the ACA sets is that the state program cover adults earning no more than 133 % of the federal poverty line . Enforcing that prescription ensures that federal funds will be spent on health care for the poor in furtherance of Congress' present perception of the general welfare .	articlei#section8
The Chief Justice asserts that the Medicaid expan - sion creates a " new health care program . " Ante , at 54 . Moreover , States could " hardly anticipate " that Congress would " transform [ the program ] so dramatically . " Ante , at 55 . Therefore , The Chief Justice maintains , Congress' threat to withhold " old " Medicaid funds based on a State 's refusal to participate in the " new " program is a " threa[t ] to terminate [ an]other . . . independent gran[t ] . " Ante , at 50 , 52–53 . And because the threat to withhold a large amount of funds from one program " leaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce [ in a newly created program ] , " The Chief Justice concludes , the Medicaid expansion is unconstitutionally coercive . Ante , at 52 .	unmatched
The starting premise on which The Chief Justice 's coercion analysis rests is that the ACA did not really " extend " Medicaid ; instead , Congress created an entirely new program to co - exist with the old . The Chief Justice calls the ACA new , but in truth , it simply reaches more of America 's poor than Congress originally covered .	unmatched
Medicaid was created to enable States to provide medical assistance to " needy persons . " See S. Rep. No . 404 , 89th Cong . , 1st Sess . , pt . 1 , p. 9 ( 1965 ) . See also § 121(a ) , 79Stat . 343 ( The purpose of Medicaid is to enable States " to furnish . . . medical assistance on behalf of [ certain persons ] whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services . " ) . By bringing health care within the reach of a larger population of Americans unable to afford it , the Medicaid expansion is an extension of that basic aim .	unmatched
The Medicaid Act contains hundreds of provisions governing operation of the program , setting conditions ranging from " Limitation on payments to States for expend - itures attributable to taxes , " 42 U. S. C. § 1396a(t ) ( 2006 ed . ) , to " Medical assistance to aliens not lawfully admitted for permanent residence , " § 1396b(v ) ( 2006 ed . and Supp . IV ) . The Medicaid expansion leaves unchanged the vast majority of these provisions ; it adds beneficiaries to the existing program and specifies the rate at which States will be reimbursed for services provided to the added bene - ficiaries . See ACA § § 2001(a)(1 ) , ( 3 ) , 124Stat . 271–272 . The ACA does not describe operational aspects of the program for these newly eligible persons ; for that information , one must read the existing Medicaid Act . See 42 U. S. C. § § 1396–1396v(b ) ( 2006 ed . and Supp . IV ) .	unmatched
Congress styled and clearly viewed the Medicaid expansion as an amendment to the Medicaid Act , not as a " new " health - care program . To the four categories of beneficiaries for whom coverage became mandatory in 1965 , and the three mandatory classes added in the late 1980 's , see supra , at 41–42 , the ACA adds an eighth : individuals under 65 with incomes not exceeding 133 % of the federal poverty level . The expansion is effectuated by § 2001 of the ACA , aptly titled : " Medicaid Coverage for the Lowest Income Populations . " 124Stat . 271 . That section amends Title 42 , Chapter 7 , Subchapter XIX : Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs . Commonly known as the Medicaid Act , Subchapter XIX filled some 278 pages in 2006 . Section 2001 of the ACA would add approximately three pages . 19	unmatched
Congress has broad authority to construct or adjust spending programs to meet its contemporary understanding of " the general Welfare . " Helvering v. Davis , 301 U. S. 619–641 ( 1937 ) . Courts owe a large measure of respect to Congress' characterization of the grant programs it establishes . See Steward Machine , 301 U. S. , at 594 . Even if courts were inclined to second - guess Congress' conception of the character of its legislation , how would reviewing judges divine whether an Act of Congress , purporting to amend a law , is in reality not an amendment , but a new creation ? At what point does an extension become so large that it " transforms " the basic law ?	articlei#section8
Endeavoring to show that Congress created a new program , The Chief Justice cites three aspects of the expansion . First , he asserts that , in covering those earning no more than 133 % of the federal poverty line , the Medicaid expansion , unlike pre - ACA Medicaid , does not " care for the neediest among us . " Ante , at 53 . What makesthat so ? Single adults earning no more than $ 14,856 per year—133 % of the current federal poverty level — surely rank among the Nation 's poor .	unmatched
Second , according to The Chief Justice , " Congress mandated that newly eligible persons receive a level of coverage that is less comprehensive than the traditional Medicaid benefit package . " Ibid . That less comprehensive benefit package , however , is not an innovation introduced by the ACA ; since 2006 , States have been free to use it for many of their Medicaid beneficiaries . 20 The level of benefits offered therefore does not set apart post - ACA Medicaid recipients from all those entitled to benefits pre - ACA .	unmatched
Third , The Chief Justice correctly notes that the reimbursement rate for participating States is differ - ent regarding individuals who became Medicaid - eligible through the ACA . Ibid . But the rate differs only in its generosity to participating States . Under pre - ACA Medicaid , the Federal Government pays up to 83 % of the costs of coverage for current enrollees , § 1396d(b ) ( 2006 ed . and Supp . IV ) ; under the ACA , the federal contribution starts at 100 % and will eventually settle at 90 % , § 1396d(y ) . Even if one agreed that a change of as little as 7 percentage points carries constitutional significance , is it not passing strange to suggest that the purported incursion on state sovereignty might have been averted , or at least mitigated , had Congress offered States less money to carry out the same obligations ?	unmatched
Consider also that Congress could have repealed Medicaid . See supra , at 38–39 ( citing 42 U. S. C. § 1304 ) ; Brief for Petitioners in No . 11–400 , p. 41 . Thereafter , Congress could have enacted Medicaid II , a new program combin - ing the pre-2010 coverage with the expanded coverage required by the ACA . By what right does a court stop Congress from building up without first tearing down ?	unmatched
The Chief Justice finds the Medicaid expansion vulnerable because it took participating States by surprise . Ante , at 54 . " A State could hardly anticipate that Congres[s ] " would endeavor to " transform [ the Medicaid program ] so dramatically , " he states . Ante , at 54–55 . For the notion that States must be able to foresee , when they sign up , alterations Congress might make later on , The Chief Justice cites only one case : Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman , 451 U. S. 1 .	unmatched
In Pennhurst , residents of a state - run , federally funded institution for the mentally disabled complained of abusive treatment and inhumane conditions in alleged violation of the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act . 451 U. S. , at 5–6 . We held that the State was not answerable in damages for violating conditionsit did not " voluntarily and knowingly accep[t ] . " Id. , at 17 , 27 . Inspecting the statutory language and legislative his - tory , we found that the Act did not " unambiguously " impose the requirement on which the plaintiffs relied : that they receive appropriate treatment in the least restrictive environment . Id. , at 17–18 . Satisfied that Congress had not clearly conditioned the States' receipt of federal funds on the States' provision of such treatment , we declined to read such a requirement into the Act . Congress' spending power , we concluded , " does not include surprising participating States with postacceptance or ‘ retroactive' conditions . " Id. , at 24–25 .	unmatched
Pennhurst thus instructs that " if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys , it must do so unambiguously . " Ante , at 53 ( quoting Pennhurst , 451 U. S. , at 17 ) . That requirement is met in this case . Section 2001 does not take effect until 2014 . The ACA makes perfectly clear what will be required of States that accept Medicaid funding after that date : They must extend eligibility to adults with incomes no more than 133 % of the federal poverty line . See 42 U. S. C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A ) ( i)(VIII ) ( 2006 ed . and Supp . IV ) .	unmatched
The Chief Justice appears to find in Pennhurst a requirement that , when spending legislation is first passed , or when States first enlist in the federal program , Congress must provide clear notice of conditions it might later impose . If I understand his point correctly , it was incumbent on Congress , in 1965 , to warn the States clearly of the size and shape potential changes to Medicaid might take . And absent such notice , sizable changes could not be made mandatory . Our decisions do not support such a requirement . 21	unmatched
In Bennett v. New Jersey , 470 U. S. 632 ( 1985 ) , the Secretary of Education sought to recoup Title I funds 22 based on the State 's noncompliance , from 1970 to 1972 , with a 1978 amendment to Title I. Relying on Pennhurst , we rejected the Secretary 's attempt to recover funds based on the States' alleged violation of a rule that did not exist when the State accepted and spent the funds . See 470 U. S. , at 640 ( " New Jersey [ , ] when it applied for and received Title I funds for the years 1970–1972 [ , ] had no basis to believe that the propriety of the expenditures would be judged by any standards other than the ones in effect at the time . " ( citing Pennhurst , 451 U. S. , at 17 , 24–25 ; emphasis added ) ) .	unmatched
When amendment of an existing grant program has no such retroactive effect , however , we have upheld Congress' instruction . In Bennett v. Kentucky Dept . of Ed . , 470 U. S. 656 ( 1985 ) , the Secretary sued to recapture Title I funds based on the Commonwealth 's 1974 violation of a spending condition Congress added to Title I in 1970 . Rejecting Kentucky 's argument pinned to Pennhurst , we held that the Commonwealth suffered no surprise after accepting the federal funds . Kentucky was therefore obliged to re - turn the money . 470 U. S. , at 665–666 , 673–674 . The conditions imposed were to be assessed as of 1974 , in light of " the legal requirements in place when the grants were made , " i d . , at 670 , not as of 1965 , when Title I was originally enacted .	unmatched
As these decisions show , Pennhurst 's rule demands that conditions on federal funds be unambiguously clear at the time a State receives and uses the money — not at the time , perhaps years earlier , when Congress passed the law establishing the program . See also Dole , 483 U. S. , at 208 ( finding Pennhurst satisfied based on the clarity of the Federal Aid Highway Act as amended in 1984 , without looking back to 1956 , the year of the Act 's adoption ) .	unmatched
In any event , from the start , the Medicaid Act put States on notice that the program could be changed : " The right to alter , amend , or repeal any provision of [ Medicaid ] , " the statute has read since 1965 , " is hereby reserved to the Congress . " 42 U. S. C. § 1304 . The " effect of these few simple words " has long been settled . See National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Atchison , T. & S. F. R. Co. , 470 U. S. 451–468 , n. 22 ( 1985 ) ( citing Sinking Fund Cases , 99 U. S. 700 , 720 ( 1879 ) ) . By reserving the right to " alter , amend , [ or ] repeal " a spending program , Congress " has given special notice of its intention to retain . . . full and complete power to make such alterations and amendments . . . as come within the just scope of legislative power . " Id. , at 720 .	unmatched
Our decision in Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security Entrapment , 477 U. S. 41–52 ( 1986 ) , is guiding here . As enacted in 1935 , the Social Security Act did not cover state employees . Id. , at 44 . In response to pressure from States that wanted coverage for their employees , Congress , in 1950 , amended the Act to allow States to opt into the program . Id. , at 45 . The statutory provision giving States this option expressly permitted them to withdraw from the program . Ibid .	unmatched
Beginning in the late 1970 's , States increasingly exercised the option to withdraw . Id. , at 46 . Concerned that withdrawals were threatening the integrity of Social Security , Congress repealed the termination provision . Congress thereby changed Social Security from a program voluntary for the States to one from which they could not escape . Id. , at 48 . California objected , arguing that the change impermissibly deprived it of a right to withdraw from Social Security . Id. , at 49–50 . We unanimously rejected California 's argument . Id. , at 51–53 . By including in the Act " a clause expressly reserving to it ‘ [ t]he right to alter , amend , or repeal any provision' of the Act , " we held , Congress put States on notice that the Act"created no contractual rights . " Id. , at 51–52 . The States therefore had no law - based ground on which to complain about the amendment , despite the significant character of the change .	unmatched
The Chief Justice nevertheless would rewrite § 1304to countenance only the " right to alter somewhat , " or " amend , but not too much . " Congress , however , did not so qualify § 1304 . Indeed , Congress retained discretion to " repeal " Medicaid , wiping it out entirely . Cf . Delta Air Lines , Inc. v. August , 450 U. S. 346 , 368 ( 1981 ) ( Rehnquist , J. , dissenting ) ( invoking " the common - sense maxim that the greater includes the lesser " ) . As Bowen indicates , no State could reasonably have read § 1304 as reserving to Congress authority to make adjustments only if modestly sized .	unmatched
In fact , no State proceeded on that understanding . In com - pliance with Medicaid regulations , each State expressly undertook to abide by future Medicaid changes . See 42 CFR § 430.12(c)(1 ) ( 2011 ) ( " The [ state Medicaid ] plan must provide that it will be amended whenever necessary to reflect . . . [ c]hanges in Federal law , regulations , policy interpretations , or court decisions . " ) . Whenever a State notifies the Federal Government of a change in its own Medicaid program , the State certifies both that it knows the federally set terms of participation may change , and that it will abide by those changes as a condition of continued participation . See , e.g. , Florida Agency for Health Care Admin . , State Plan Under Title XIX of the Social Security Act Medical Assistance Program § 7.1 , p. 86 ( Oct. 6 , 1992 ) .	unmatched
The Chief Justice insists that the most recent expansion , in contrast to its predecessors , " accomplishes a shift in kind , not merely degree . " Ante , at 53 . But why was Medicaid altered only in degree , not in kind , when Congress required States to cover millions of children and pregnant women ? See supra , at 41–42 . Congress did not " merely alte[r ] and expan[d ] the boundaries of " the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program . But see ante , at 53–55 . Rather , Congress required participating States to provide coverage tied to the federal poverty level ( as it later did in the ACA ) , rather than to the AFDC program . See Brief for National Health Law Program et al . as Amici Curiae 16–18 . In short , given § 1304 , this Court 's construction of § 1304 's language in Bowen , and the enlargement of Medicaid in the years since 1965 , 23 a State would be hard put to complain that it lacked fair notice when , in 2010 , Congress altered Medicaid to embrace a larger portion of the Nation 's poor .	unmatched
The Chief Justice ultimately asks whether " the financial inducement offered by Congress . . . pass[ed ] the point at which pressure turns into compulsion . " Ante , at 50 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . The financial inducement Congress employed here , he concludes , crosses that threshold : The threatened withholding of " existing Medicaid funds " is " a gun to the head " that forces States to acquiesce . Ante , at 50–51 ( citing 42 U. S. C. § 1396c ) . 24	unmatched
The Chief Justice sees no need to " fix the outermost line , " Steward Machine , 301 U. S. , at 591 , " where persuasion gives way to coercion , " ante , at 55 . Neither do the joint dissenters . See post , at 36 , 38 . 25 Notably , the decision on which they rely , Steward Machine , found the statute at issue inside the line , " wherever the line may be . " 301 U. S. , at 591 .	unmatched
When future Spending Clause challenges arrive , as they likely will in the wake of today 's decision , how will litigants and judges assess whether " a State has a legitimate choice whether to accept the federal conditions in exchange for federal funds " ? Ante , at 48 . Are courts to measure the number of dollars the Federal Government might withhold for noncompliance ? The portion of the State 's budget at stake ? And which State's — or States'—budget is determinative : the lead plaintiff , all challenging States ( 26 in this case , many with quite different fiscal situations ) , or some national median ? Does it matter that Florida , unlike most States , imposes no state income tax , and therefore might be able to replace foregone federal funds with new state revenue ? 26 Or that the coercion state officials in fact fear is punishment at the ballot box for turning down a politically popular federal grant ?	articlei#section8
The coercion inquiry , therefore , appears to involve polit - ical judgments that defy judicial calculation . See Bakerv . Carr , 369 U. S. 186 , 217 ( 1962 ) . Even commentators sympathetic to robust enforcement of Dole 's limitations , see supra , at 46 , have concluded that conceptions of"impermissible coercion " premised on States' perceived inability to decline federal funds " are just too amorphous to be judicially administrable . " Baker & Berman , Getting off the Dole , 78 Ind. L. J. 459 , 521 , 522 , n. 307 ( 2003 ) ( citing , e.g. , Scalia , The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules , 56 U. Chi . L. Rev. 1175 ( 1989 ) ) .	unmatched
At bottom , my colleagues' position is that the States' reliance on federal funds limits Congress' authority to alter its spending programs . This gets things backwards : Congress , not the States , is tasked with spending federal money in service of the general welfare . And each successive Congress is empowered to appropriate funds as it sees fit . When the 110th Congress reached a conclusion about Medicaid funds that differed from its predecessors' view , it abridged no State 's right to " existing , " or " pre - existing , " funds . But see ante , at 51–52 ; post , at 47–48 ( joint opinion of Scalia , Kennedy , Thomas , and Alito , JJ . ) . For , in fact , there are no such funds . There is only money States anticipate receiving from future Congresses .	articlei#section8
Congress has delegated to the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to withhold , in whole orin part , federal Medicaid funds from States that fail to comply with the Medicaid Act as originally composed and as subsequently amended . 42 U. S. C. § 1396c . 27 The Chief Justice , however , holds that the Constitution precludes the Secretary from withholding " existing " Medicaid funds based on States' refusal to comply with the expanded Medi - caid program . Ante , at 55 . For the foregoing reasons , I disagree that any such withholding would violate the Spending Clause . Accordingly , I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in this regard .	articlei#section8
But in view of The Chief Justice 's disposition , I agree with him that the Medicaid Act 's severability clause determines the appropriate remedy . That clause provides that " [ i]f any provision of [ the Medicaid Act ] , or the application thereof to any person or circumstance , is held in - valid , the remainder of the chapter , and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby . " 42 U. S. C. § 1303 .	unmatched
The Court does not strike down any provision of the ACA . It prohibits only the " application " of the Secretary 's authority to withhold Medicaid funds from States that decline to conform their Medicaid plans to the ACA 's requirements . Thus the ACA 's authorization of funds to finance the expansion remains intact , and the Secretary 's authority to withhold funds for reasons other than noncompliance with the expansion remains unaffected .	unmatched
Even absent § 1303 's command , we would have no warrant to invalidate the Medicaid expansion , contra post , at 46–48 ( joint opinion of Scalia , Kennedy , Thomas , and Alito , JJ . ) , not to mention the entire ACA , post , at 49–64 ( same ) . For when a court confronts an unconstitutional statute , its endeavor must be to conserve , not destroy , the legislature 's dominant objective . See , e.g. , Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng . , 546 U. S. 320–330 ( 2006 ) . In this case , that objective was to increase access to health care for the poor by increasing the States' access to federal funds . The Chief Justice is undoubtedly right to conclude that Congress may offer States funds " to expand the availability of health care , and requir[e ] that States accepting such funds comply with the conditions on their use . " Ante , at 55 . I therefore concurin the judgment with respect to Part IV – B of The Chief Justice 's opinion .	unmatched
For the reasons stated , I agree with The Chief Justice that , as to the validity of the minimum coverage provi - sion , the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit should be reversed . In my view , the provision en - counters no constitutional obstruction . Further , I would uphold the Eleventh Circuit 's decision that the Medicaid expansion is within Congress' spending power .	articlei#section8
Congress has set out to remedy the problem that the best health care is beyond the reach of many Americans who can not afford it . It can assuredly do that , by exercising the powers accorded to it under the Constitution . The question in this case , however , is whether the complex structures and provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( Affordable Care Act or ACA ) go be - yond those powers . We conclude that they do .	unmatched
This case is in one respect difficult : it presents two questions of first impression . The first of those is whether failure to engage in economic activity ( the purchase of health insurance ) is subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause . Failure to act does result in an effecton commerce , and hence might be said to come underthis Court 's " affecting commerce " criterion of Commerce Clause jurisprudence . But in none of its decisions has this Court extended the Clause that far . The second question is whether the congressional power to tax and spend , U. S. Const . , Art . I , § 8 , cl . 1 , permits the conditioning ofa State 's continued receipt of all funds under a massive state - administered federal welfare program upon its acceptance of an expansion to that program . Several of our opinions have suggested that the power to tax and spend can not be used to coerce state administration of a federal program , but we have never found a law enacted under the spending power to be coercive . Those questions are difficult .	articlei#section8
The case is easy and straightforward , however , in another respect . What is absolutely clear , affirmed by the text of the 1789 Constitution , by the Tenth Amendment ratified in 1791 , and by innumerable cases of ours in the 220 years since , is that there are structural limits upon federal power — upon what it can prescribe with respect to private conduct , and upon what it can impose upon the sovereign States . Whatever may be the conceptual limits upon the Commerce Clause and upon the power to taxand spend , they can not be such as will enable the Federal Government to regulate all private conduct and to com - pel the States to function as administrators of federalprograms .	articlei#section8,tenth_amendment
That clear principle carries the day here . The striking case of Wickard v. Filburn , 317 U. S. 111 ( 1942 ) , which held that the economic activity of growing wheat , evenfor one 's own consumption , affected commerce sufficiently that it could be regulated , always has been regarded as the ne plus ultra of expansive Commerce Clause jurisprudence . To go beyond that , and to say the failure to grow wheat ( which is not an economic activity , or any activityat all ) nonetheless affects commerce and therefore can be federally regulated , is to make mere breathing in and out the basis for federal prescription and to extend federal power to virtually all human activity .	articlei#section8
As for the constitutional power to tax and spend forthe general welfare : The Court has long since expanded that beyond ( what Madison thought it meant ) taxing and spending for those aspects of the general welfare that were within the Federal Government 's enumerated powers , see United States v. Butler , 297 U. S. 1–66 ( 1936 ) . Thus , we now have sizable federal Departments devotedto subjects not mentioned among Congress' enumerated powers , and only marginally related to commerce : the De - partment of Education , the Department of Health and Human Services , the Department of Housing and Urban Development . The principal practical obstacle that prevents Congress from using the tax - and - spend power to assume all the general - welfare responsibilities traditionally exercised by the States is the sheer impossibility of managing a Federal Government large enough to administer such a system . That obstacle can be overcome by granting funds to the States , allowing them to administer the program . That is fair and constitutional enough when the States freely agree to have their powers employed and their employees enlisted in the federal scheme . But it is a blatant violation of the constitutional structure when the States have no choice .	articlei#section8
The Act before us here exceeds federal power both in mandating the purchase of health insurance and in denying nonconsenting States all Medicaid funding . These parts of the Act are central to its design and operation , and all the Act 's other provisions would not have been enacted without them . In our view it must follow that the entire statute is inoperative .	unmatched
The Individual Mandate	unmatched
Article I , § 8 , of the Constitution gives Congress the power to " regulate Commerce . . . among the several States . " The Individual Mandate in the Act commands that every " applicable individual shall for each month beginning after 2013 ensure that the individual , and any dependent of the individual who is an applicable individ - ual , is covered under minimum essential coverage . " 26 U. S. C. § 5000A(a ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) . If this provision " regulates " anything , it is the failure to maintain minimum essential coverage . One might argue that it regulates that failure by requiring it to be accompanied by payment of a penalty . But that failure — that abstention from commerce — is not " Commerce . " To be sure , purchasing insurance is " Commerce " ; but one does not regulate commerce that does not exist by compelling its existence .	articlei#section8
In Gibbons v. Ogden , 9 Wheat . 1 , 196 ( 1824 ) , Chief Justice Marshall wrote that the power to regulate commerce is the power " to prescribe the rule by whichcommerce is to be governed . " That understanding is con - sistent with the original meaning of " regulate " at the time of the Constitution 's ratification , when " to regulate " meant " [ t]o adjust by rule , method or established mode , " 2 N. Webster , An American Dictionary of the English Language ( 1828 ) ; " [ t]o adjust by rule or method , " 2 S. Johnson , A Dictionary of the English Language ( 7th ed . 1785 ) ; " [ t]o adjust , to direct according to rule , " 2 J. Ash , New and Complete Dictionary of the English Language ( 1775 ) ; " to put in order , set to rights , govern or keep in order , " T. Dyche & W. Pardon , A New General English Dictionary	articlei#section8
( 16th ed . 1777 ) . 1 It can mean to direct the manner of something but not to direct that something come into being . There is no instance in which this Court or Congress ( or anyone else , to our knowledge ) has used " regulate " in that peculiar fashion . If the word bore that meaning , Congress' authority " [ t]o make Rules for the Govern - ment and Regulation of the land and naval Forces , " U. S. Const . , Art . I , § 8 , cl . 14 , would have made superfluousthe later provision for authority " [ t]o raise and support Armies , " i d . , § 8 , cl . 12 , and " [ t]o provide and maintain a Navy , " i d . , § 8 , cl . 13 .	articlei#section8
We do not doubt that the buying and selling of health insurance contracts is commerce generally subject to federal regulation . But when Congress provides that ( nearly ) all citizens must buy an insurance contract , it goes beyond " adjust[ing ] by rule or method , " Johnson , supra , or " direct[ing ] according to rule , " Ash , supra ; it directs the creation of commerce .	articlei#section8
In response , the Government offers two theories as to why the Individual Mandate is nevertheless constitutional . Neither theory suffices to sustain its validity .	unmatched
First , the Government submits that § 5000A is " integral to the Affordable Care Act 's insurance reforms " and " necessary to make effective the Act 's core reforms . " Brieffor Petitioners in No . 11–398 ( Minimum Coverage Provision ) 24 ( hereinafter Petitioners' Minimum Coverage Brief ) . Congress included a " finding " to similar effect in the Act	unmatched
itself . See 42 U. S. C. § 18091(2)(H ) .	unmatched
As discussed in more detail in Part V , infra , the Act contains numerous health insurance reforms , but most notable for present purposes are the " guaranteed issue " and " community rating " provisions , § § 300gg to 300gg–4 . The former provides that , with a few exceptions , " each health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the individual or group market in a State must accept every employer and individual in the State that applies for such coverage . " § 300gg–1(a ) . That is , an insurer may not deny coverage on the basis of , among other things , any pre - existing medical condition that the applicant may have , and the resulting insurance must cover that condition . See § 300gg–3 .	unmatched
Under ordinary circumstances , of course , insurers would respond by charging high premiums to individuals with pre - existing conditions . The Act seeks to prevent this through the community - rating provision . Simply put , the community - rating provision requires insurers to calculate an individual 's insurance premium based on only four factors : ( i ) whether the individual 's plan covers justthe individual or his family also , ( ii ) the " rating area " in which the individual lives , ( iii ) the individual 's age , and ( iv ) whether the individual uses tobacco . § 300gg(a)(1)(A ) . Aside from the rough proxies of age and tobacco use ( and possibly rating area ) , the Act does not allow an insurer to factor the individual 's health characteristics into the price of his insurance premium . This creates a new incentive for young and healthy individuals without pre - existing conditions . The insurance premiums for those in this group will not reflect their own low actuarial risks but will subsidize insurance for others in the pool . Many of them may decide that purchasing health insurance is not an eco - nomically sound decision — especially since the guaranteed - issue provision will enable them to purchase it at thesame cost in later years and even if they have developed a pre - existing condition . But without the contribution of above - risk premiums from the young and healthy , the community - rating provision will not enable insurers to take on high - risk individuals without a massive increase in premiums .	unmatched
The Government presents the Individual Mandate as a unique feature of a complicated regulatory scheme governing many parties with countervailing incentives that must be carefully balanced . Congress has imposed an extensive set of regulations on the health insurance industry , and compliance with those regulations will likely cost the in - dustry a great deal . If the industry does not respond by increasing premiums , it is not likely to survive . And ifthe industry does increase premiums , then there is a seri - ous risk that its products — insurance plans — will become economically undesirable for many and prohibitively ex - pensive for the rest .	unmatched
This is not a dilemma unique to regulation of the health - insurance industry . Government regulation typically imposes costs on the regulated industry — especially regulation that prohibits economic behavior in which most market participants are already engaging , such as " piecing out " the market by selling the product to different classes of people at different prices ( in the present context , providing much lower insurance rates to young and healthy buyers ) . And many industries so regulated face the reality that , without an artificial increase in demand , they can not continue on . When Congress is regulating these industries directly , it enjoys the broad power to enact " ‘ all appropriate legislation' " to " ‘ protec[t]' " and " ‘ advanc[e]' " commerce , NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. , 301 U. S. 1–37 ( 1937 ) ( quoting The Daniel Ball , 10 Wall . 557 , 564 ( 1871 ) ) . Thus , Congress might protect the imperiled industry by prohibiting low - cost competition , or by according it preferential tax treatment , or even by granting it a direct subsidy .	articlei#section8
Here , however , Congress has impressed into service third parties , healthy individuals who could be but are not customers of the relevant industry , to offset the undesirable consequences of the regulation . Congress' desire to force these individuals to purchase insurance is motivated by the fact that they are further removed from the market than unhealthy individuals with pre - existing conditions , because they are less likely to need extensive care inthe near future . If Congress can reach out and command even those furthest removed from an interstate market to participate in the market , then the Commerce Clause becomes a font of unlimited power , or in Hamilton 's words , " the hideous monster whose devouring jaws . . . spare neither sex nor age , nor high nor low , nor sacred nor profane . " The Federalist No . 33 , p. 202 ( C. Rossiter ed . 1961 ) .	articlei#section8
At the outer edge of the commerce power , this Court has insisted on careful scrutiny of regulations that do notact directly on an interstate market or its participants . In New York v. United States , 505 U. S. 144 ( 1992 ) , we held that Congress could not , in an effort to regulate the disposal of radioactive waste produced in several different industries , order the States to take title to that waste . Id . , at 174–177 . In Printz v. United States , 521 U. S.898 ( 1997 ) , we held that Congress could not , in an effort to regulate the distribution of firearms in the interstate mar - ket , compel state law - enforcement officials to perform background checks . Id. , at 933–935 . In United States v. Lopez , 514 U. S. 549 ( 1995 ) , we held that Congress could not , as a means of fostering an educated interstate labor market through the protection of schools , ban the possession of a firearm within a school zone . Id. , at 559–563 . And in United States v. Morrison , 529 U. S. 598 ( 2000 ) , we held that Congress could not , in an effort to ensure the full participation of women in the interstate economy , subject private individuals and companies to suit for gender - motivated violent torts . Id. , at 609–619 . The lesson of these cases is that the Commerce Clause , even when sup - plemented by the Necessary and Proper Clause , is not carte blanche for doing whatever will help achieve the ends Congress seeks by the regulation of commerce . And the last two of these cases show that the scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause is exceeded not only when the congressional action directly violates the sovereignty of the States but also when it violates the background principle of enumerated ( and hence limited ) federal power .	articlei#section8
The case upon which the Government principally relies to sustain the Individual Mandate under the Necessary and Proper Clause is Gonzales v. Raich , 545 U. S. 1 ( 2005 ) . That case held that Congress could , in an effort to restrain the interstate market in marijuana , ban the local cultivation and possession of that drug . Id. , at 15–22 . Raichis no precedent for what Congress has done here . That case 's prohibition of growing ( cf . Wickard , 317 U. S. 111 ) , and of possession ( cf . innumerable federal statutes ) did not represent the expansion of the federal power to direct into a broad new field . The mandating of economic activity does , and since it is a field so limitless that it converts the Commerce Clause into a general authority to direct the economy , that mandating is not " consist[ent ] with the letter and spirit of the constitution . " McCulloch v. Maryland , 4 Wheat . 316 , 421 ( 1819 ) .	articlei#section8
Moreover , Raich is far different from the Individual Mandate in another respect . The Court 's opinion in Raich pointed out that the growing and possession prohibitions were the only practicable way of enabling the prohibition of interstate traffic in marijuana to be effectively enforced . 545 U. S. , at 22 . See also Shreveport Rate Cases , 234 U. S. 342 ( 1914 ) ( Necessary and Proper Clause allows regulations of intrastate transactions if necessary to the regulation of an interstate market ) . Intrastate marijuana could no more be distinguished from interstate marijuana than , for example , endangered - species trophies obtained before the species was federally protected can be distinguished from trophies obtained afterwards — which made it necessary and proper to prohibit the sale of all such trophies , see Andrus v. Allard , 444 U. S. 51 ( 1979 ) .	articlei#section8
With the present statute , by contrast , there are many ways other than this unprecedented Individual Mandate by which the regulatory scheme 's goals of reducing insurance premiums and ensuring the profitability of insurers could be achieved . For instance , those who did not purchase insurance could be subjected to a surcharge when they do enter the health insurance system . Or they could be denied a full income tax credit given to those who do purchase the insurance .	articlei#section8
The Government was invited , at oral argument , to suggest what federal controls over private conduct ( other than those explicitly prohibited by the Bill of Rights or other constitutional controls ) could not be justified as necessary and proper for the carrying out of a general regulatory scheme . See Tr . of Oral Arg . 27–30 , 43–45 ( Mar. 27 , 2012 ) . It was unable to name any . As we said at the outset , whereas the precise scope of the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause is uncertain , the proposition that the Federal Government can not do everything is a fundamental precept . See Lopez , 514 U. S. , at 564 ( " [ I]f we were to accept the Government 's arguments , we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an in - dividual that Congress is without power to regulate " ) . Section 5000A is defeated by that proposition .	articlei#section8
The Government 's second theory in support of the In - dividual Mandate is that § 5000A is valid because it is actually a " regulat[ion of ] activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce , . . . i.e. , . . . activities that substantially affect interstate commerce . " Id. , at 558–559 . See also Shreveport Rate Cases , supra . This argument takes a few different forms , but the basic idea is that § 5000A regulates " the way in which individuals finance their participation in the health - care market . " Petitioners' Minimum Coverage Brief 33 ( emphasis added ) . That is , the provision directs the manner in which individuals purchase health care services and related goods ( directing that they be purchased through insurance ) and is therefore a straightforward exercise of the commerce power .	articlei#section8
The primary problem with this argument is that § 5000A does not apply only to persons who purchase all , or most , or even any , of the health care services or goods that the mandated insurance covers . Indeed , the main objection many have to the Mandate is that they have no intention of purchasing most or even any of such goods or services and thus no need to buy insurance for those purchases . The Government responds that the health - care market involves " essentially universal participation , " i d . , at 35 . The principal difficulty with this response is that it is , in the only relevant sense , not true . It is true enough that everyone consumes " health care , " if the term is taken to include the purchase of a bottle of aspirin . But the health care " market " that is the object of the Individual Mandate not only includes but principally consists of goods and services that the young people primarily affected by the Mandate do not purchase . They are quite simply not participants in that market , and can not be made so ( and thereby subjected to regulation ) by the simple device of defining participants to include all those who will , later in their lifetime , probably purchase the goods or services covered by the mandated insurance . 2 Such a definition of market participants is unprecedented , and were it to be a premise for the exercise of national power , it would have no principled limits .	unmatched
In a variation on this attempted exercise of federal power , the Government points out that Congress in this Act has purported to regulate " economic and financial decision[s ] to forego [ sic ] health insurance coverage and [ to ] attempt to self - insure , " 42 U. S. C. § 18091(2)(A ) , since those decisions have " a substantial and deleterious effect on interstate commerce , " Petitioners' Minimum Coverage Brief 34 . But as the discussion above makes clear , the decision to forgo participation in an interstate market is not itself commercial activity ( or indeed any activity at all ) within Congress' power to regulate . It is true that , at the end of the day , it is inevitable that each American will affect commerce and become a part of it , even if not by choice . But if every person comes within the Commerce Clause power of Congress to regulate by the simple reason that he will one day engage in commerce , the idea of a limited Government power is at an end .	articlei#section8
Wickard v. Filburn has been regarded as the most expansive assertion of the commerce power in our history . A close second is Perez v. United States , 402 U. S. 146 ( 1971 ) , which upheld a statute criminalizing the eminently local activity of loan - sharking . Both of those cases , however ,	articlei#section8
involved commercial activity . To go beyond that , and to say that the failure to grow wheat or the refusal to make loans affects commerce , so that growing and lending can be federally compelled , is to extend federal power to virtually everything . All of us consume food , and when we do so the Federal Government can prescribe what its quality must be and even how much we must pay . But the mere fact that we all consume food and are thus , sooner or later , participants in the " market " for food , does not empower the Government to say when and what we will buy . That is essentially what this Act seeks to do with respect to the purchase of health care . It exceeds federal power .	articlei#section8
A few respectful responses to Justice Ginsburg 's dissent on the issue of the Mandate are in order . That dissent duly recites the test of Commerce Clause power that our opinions have applied , but disregards the premise the test contains . It is true enough that Congress needs only a " ‘ rational basis' for concluding that the regulated activity substantially affects interstate commerce , " ante , at 15 ( em - phasis added ) . But it must be activity affecting com - merce that is regulated , and not merely the failure to engage in commerce . And one is not now purchasingthe health care covered by the insurance mandate simply because one is likely to be purchasing it in the future . Our test 's premise of regulated activity is not invented out of whole cloth , but rests upon the Constitution 's requirement that it be commerce which is regulated . If all inactivity affecting commerce is commerce , commerce is everything . Ultimately the dissent is driven to saying that there is really no difference between action and inaction , ante , at 26 , a proposition that has never recommended itself , neither to the law nor to common sense . To say , for example , that the inaction here consists of activity in " the self - insurance market , " ibid . , seems to us wordplay . By parity of reasoning the failure to buy a car can be called participation in the non - private - car - transportation market . Com - merce becomes everything .	articlei#section8
The dissent claims that we " fai[l ] to explain why the individual mandate threatens our constitutional order . " Ante , at 35 . But we have done so . It threatens that order because it gives such an expansive meaning to the Commerce Clause that all private conduct ( including failure to act ) becomes subject to federal control , effectively destroying the Constitution 's division of governmental powers . Thus the dissent , on the theories proposed for the validity of the Mandate , would alter the accepted constitutional relation between the individual and the National Government . The dissent protests that the Necessary and Proper Clause has been held to include " the power to enact criminal laws , . . . the power to imprison , . . . and the power to create a national bank , " ante , at 34–35 . Is not the power to compel purchase of health insurance much lesser ? No , not if ( unlike those other dispositions ) its application rests upon a theory that everything is within federal control simply because it exists .	articlei#section8
The dissent 's exposition of the wonderful things the Fed - eral Government has achieved through exercise of its assigned powers , such as " the provision of old - age and survivors' benefits " in the Social Security Act , ante , at 2,is quite beside the point . The issue here is whether the federal government can impose the Individual Mandate through the Commerce Clause . And the relevant history is not that Congress has achieved wide and wonderful results through the proper exercise of its assigned powers in the past , but that it has never before used the Commerce Clause to compel entry into commerce . 3 The dissent treats the Constitution as though it is an enumeration of those problems that the Federal Government can address — among which , it finds , is " the Nation 's course in the economic and social welfare realm , " ibid . , and more specifically " the problem of the uninsured , " ante , at 7.The Constitution is not that . It enumerates not federally soluble problems , but federally available powers . The Federal Government can address whatever problems it wants but can bring to their solution only those powers that the Constitution confers , among which is the power to regulate commerce . None of our cases say anything else . Article I contains no whatever - it - takes - to - solve - a - national - problem power .	articlei#section8
The dissent dismisses the conclusion that the power to compel entry into the health - insurance market would include the power to compel entry into the new - car or broccoli markets . The latter purchasers , it says , " will be obliged to pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nourishment , " whereas those refusing to purchase health - insurance will ultimately get treated anyway , at others' expense . Ante , at 21 . " [ T]he unique attributes of the health - care market . . . give rise to a significant free - riding problem that does not occur in other markets . " Ante , at 28 . And " a vegetable - purchase mandate " ( or a car - purchase mandate ) is not " likely to have a substantial effect on the health - care costs " borne by other Americans . Ante , at 29 . Those differences make a very good argument by the dissent 's own lights , since they show that the failure to purchase health insurance , unlike the failure to purchase cars or broccoli , creates a national , social - welfare problem that is ( in the dissent 's view ) included among the unenumerated " problems " that the Constitution authorizes the Federal Government to solve . But those differences do not show that the failure to enter the health - insurance market , unlike the failure to buy cars and broccoli , isan activity that Congress can " regulate . " ( Of course one day the failure of some of the public to purchase Amer - ican cars may endanger the existence of domestic automobile manufacturers ; or the failure of some to eat broccoli may be found to deprive them of a newly discovered cancer - fighting chemical which only that food contains , producing health - care costs that are a burden on the rest of us — in which case , under the theory of Justice Ginsburg 's dissent , moving against those inactivities will also come within the Federal Government 's unenumerated problem - solving powers . )	unmatched
The Taxing Power	unmatched
As far as § 5000A is concerned , we would stop there . Congress has attempted to regulate beyond the scope of its Commerce Clause authority , 4 and § 5000A is therefore invalid . The Government contends , however , as expressed in the caption to Part II of its brief , that " the minimum coverage provision is independently authorized by congress 's taxing power . " Petitioners' Minimum Coverage Brief 52 . The phrase " independently authorized " suggests the existence of a creature never hitherto seenin the United States Reports : A penalty for constitutional purposes that is also a tax for constitutional purposes . In all our cases the two are mutually exclusive . The provision challenged under the Constitution is either a penalty or else a tax . Of course in many cases what was a regu - latory mandate enforced by a penalty could have been imposed as a tax upon permissible action ; or what was im - posed as a tax upon permissible action could have been a regulatory mandate enforced by a penalty . But we know of no case , and the Government cites none , in which the imposition was , for constitutional purposes , both . 5 The two are mutually exclusive . Thus , what the Government 's caption should have read was " alternatively , the minimum coverage provision is not a mandate - with - penalty but a tax . " It is important to bear this in mind in evaluating the tax argument of the Government and of those who support it : The issue is not whether Congresshad the power to frame the minimum - coverage provision as a tax , but whether it did so .	articlei#section8
In answering that question we must , if " fairly possible , " Crowell v. Benson , 285 U. S. 22 , 62 ( 1932 ) , construe the provision to be a tax rather than a mandate - with - penalty , since that would render it constitutional rather than un - constitutional ( ut res magis valeat quam pereat ) . But we can not rewrite the statute to be what it is not . " ‘ " [ A]l - though this Court will often strain to construe legis - lation so as to save it against constitutional attack , itmust not and will not carry this to the point of perverting the purpose of a statute . . . " or judicially rewriting it.' " Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor , 478 U. S. 833 , 841 ( 1986 ) ( quoting Aptheker v. Secretary of State , 378 U. S. 500 , 515 ( 1964 ) , in turn quoting Scales v. United States , 367 U. S. 203 , 211 ( 1961 ) ) . In this case , there is simply no way , " without doing violence to the fair meaning of the words used , " Grenada County Supervisors v. Brogden , 112 U. S. 261 , 269 ( 1884 ) , to escape what Congress enacted : a mandate that individuals maintain minimum essential coverage , enforced by a penalty .	unmatched
Our cases establish a clear line between a tax and a penalty : " ‘ [ A ] tax is an enforced contribution to provide for the support of government ; a penalty . . . is an exaction imposed by statute as punishment for an unlawful act.' " United States v. Reorganized CF&I Fabricators of Utah , Inc. , 518 U. S. 213 , 224 ( 1996 ) ( quoting United States v. La Franca , 282 U. S. 568 , 572 ( 1931 ) ) . In a few cases , this Court has held that a " tax " imposed upon private conduct was so onerous as to be in effect a penalty . But we have never held — never — that a penalty imposed for violation of the law was so trivial as to be in effect a tax . We have never held that any exaction imposed for violation ofthe law is an exercise of Congress' taxing power — even when the statute calls it a tax , much less when ( as here ) the statute repeatedly calls it a penalty . When an act " adopt[s ] the criteria of wrongdoing " and then imposes a monetary penalty as the " principal consequence on those who transgress its standard , " it creates a regulatory penalty , not a tax . Child Labor Tax Case , 259 U. S. 20 , 38 ( 1922 ) .	unmatched
So the question is , quite simply , whether the exaction here is imposed for violation of the law . It unquestion - ably is . The minimum - coverage provision is found in 26 U. S. C. § 5000A , entitled " Requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage . " ( Emphasis added . ) It commands that every " applicable individual shall . . . ensure that the individual . . . is covered under minimum essential coverage . " Ibid . ( emphasis added ) . And the immediately following provision states that , " [ i]f . . . an applicableindividual . . . fails to meet the requirement of subsection ( a ) . . . there is hereby imposed . . . a penalty . " § 5000A(b ) ( emphasis added ) . And several of Congress' legislative " findings " with regard to § 5000A confirm that it sets forth a legal requirement and constitutes the assertion of regulatory power , not mere taxing power . See 42 U. S. C. § 18091(2)(A ) ( " The requirement regulates activity . . . " ) ; § 18091(2)(C ) ( " The requirement . . . will add millions of new consumers to the health insurance market . . . " ) ; § 18091(2)(D ) ( " The requirement achieves near - universal coverage " ) ; § 18091(2)(H ) ( " The requirement is an essential part of this larger regulation of economic activity , and the absence of the requirement would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance market " ) ; § 18091(3 ) ( " [ T]he Supreme Court of the United States ruled that insurance is interstate commerce subject to Federal regulation " ) .	articlei#section8
The Government and those who support its view on the tax point rely on New York v. United States , 505 U. S. 144 , to justify reading " shall " to mean " may . " The " shall " in that case was contained in an introductory provision — a recital that provided for no legal consequences — which said that " [ e]ach State shall be responsible for providing . . . for the disposal of . . . low - level radioactive waste . " 42 U. S. C. § 2021c(a)(1)(A ) . The Court did not hold that " shall " could be construed to mean " may , " but rather that this preliminary provision could not impose upon the oper - ative provisions of the Act a mandate that they did not contain : " We . . . decline petitioners' invitation to con - strue § 2021c(a)(1)(A ) , alone and in isolation , as a command to the States independent of the remainder of the Act . " New York , 505 U. S. , at 170 . Our opinion then proceeded to " consider each [ of the three operative provisions ] in turn . " Ibid . Here the mandate — the " shall"—is contained not in an inoperative preliminary recital , but in the dispositive operative provision itself . New York provides no support for reading it to be permissive .	unmatched
Quite separately , the fact that Congress ( in its own words ) " imposed . . . a penalty , " 26 U. S. C. § 5000A(b)(1 ) , for failure to buy insurance is alone sufficient to render that failure unlawful . It is one of the canons of interpretation that a statute that penalizes an act makes it unlawful : " [ W]here the statute inflicts a penalty for doing an act , although the act itself is not expressly prohibited , yet to do the act is unlawful , because it can not be supposed that the Legislature intended that a penalty should be inflicted for a lawful act . " Powhatan Steamboat Co. v. Appomattox R. Co. , 24 How . 247 , 252 ( 1861 ) . Or in the words of Chancellor Kent : " If a statute inflicts a penalty for doing an act , the penalty implies a prohibition , and the thing is unlawful , though there be no prohibitory words in the statute . " 1 J. Kent , Commentaries on American Law 436 ( 1826 ) .	unmatched
We never have classified as a tax an exaction imposed for violation of the law , and so too , we never have classified as a tax an exaction described in the legislation itself as a penalty . To be sure , we have sometimes treated as a tax a statutory exaction ( imposed for something other than a violation of law ) which bore an agnostic label that does not entail the significant constitutional consequences of a penalty — such as " license " ( License Tax Cases , 5 Wall . 462 ( 1867 ) ) or " surcharge " ( New York v. United States , supra . ) . But we have never — never — treated as a tax an exaction which faces up to the critical difference betweena tax and a penalty , and explicitly denominates the exaction a " penalty . " Eighteen times in § 5000A itself and else - where throughout the Act , Congress called the exaction in § 5000A(b ) a " penalty . "	unmatched
That § 5000A imposes not a simple tax but a mandate to which a penalty is attached is demonstrated by the fact that some are exempt from the tax who are not ex - empt from the mandate — a distinction that would makeno sense if the mandate were not a mandate . Section 5000A(d ) exempts three classes of people from the definition of " applicable individual " subject to the minimum coverage requirement : Those with religious objections or who participate in a " health care sharing ministry , " § 5000A(d)(2 ) ; those who are " not lawfully present " in the United States , § 5000A(d)(3 ) ; and those who are incarcerated , § 5000A(d)(4 ) . Section 5000A(e ) then creates a separate set of exemptions , excusing from liability for the penalty certain individuals who are subject to the minimum coverage requirement : Those who can not afford coverage , § 5000A(e)(1 ) ; who earn too little income to require filing a tax return , § 5000A(e)(2 ) ; who are members of an Indian tribe , § 5000A(e)(3 ) ; who experience only short gaps in coverage , § 5000A(e)(4 ) ; and who , in the judgment of the Secretary of Health and Human Services , " have suffered a hardship with respect to the capability to obtain coverage , " § 5000A(e)(5 ) . If § 5000A were a tax , these two classes of exemption would make no sense ; there being no requirement , all the exemptions would attach to the penalty ( renamed tax ) alone .	unmatched
In the face of all these indications of a regulatory requirement accompanied by a penalty , the Solicitor General assures us that " neither the Treasury Department nor the Department of Health and Human Services interprets Section 5000A as imposing a legal obligation , " Petitioners' Minimum Coverage Brief 61 , and that " [ i]f [ those subject to the Act ] pay the tax penalty , they 're in compliance with the law , " Tr . of Oral Arg . 50 ( Mar. 26 , 2012 ) . These self - serving litigating positions are entitled to no weight . What counts is what the statute says , and that is entirely clear . It is worth noting , moreover , that these assurances contradict the Government 's position in related litigation . Shortly before the Affordable Care Act was passed , the Commonwealth of Virginia enacted Va. Code Ann . § 38.2–3430.1:1 ( Lexis Supp . 2011 ) , which states , " No resident of [ the ] Commonwealth . . . shall be required to obtain or maintain a policy of individual insurance coverage except as required by a court or the Department of Social Services . . . . " In opposing Virginia 's assertion of standing to challenge § 5000A based on this statute , the Government said that " if the minimum coverage provision is unconstitutional , the [ Virginia ] statute is unnecessary , and if the minimum coverage provision is upheld , the state statute is void under the Supremacy Clause . " Brief for Appellantin No . 11–1057 etc . ( CA4 ) , p. 29 . But it would be void under the Supremacy Clause only if it was contradicted by a federal " require[ment ] to obtain or maintain a policy of individual insurance coverage . "	unmatched
Against the mountain of evidence that the minimum coverage requirement is what the statute calls it — a requirement — and that the penalty for its violation is what the statute calls it — a penalty — the Government brings forward the flimsiest of indications to the contrary . It notes that " [ t]he minimum coverage provision amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that a non - exempted individual . . . will owe a monetary penalty , in addition to the income tax itself , " and that " [ t]he [ Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) ] will assess and collect the penalty in the same manner as assessable penalties under the Internal Revenue Code . " Petitioners' Minimum Coverage Brief 53 . The manner of collection could perhaps suggest a tax if IRS penalty - collection were unheard - of or rare . It is not . See , e.g. , 26 U. S. C. § 527(j ) ( 2006 ed . ) ( IRS - collectible pen - alty for failure to make campaign - finance disclosures ) ; § 5761(c ) ( IRS - collectible penalty for domestic sales of to - bacco products labeled for export ) ; § 9707 ( IRS - collectible penalty for failure to make required health - insurance premium payments on behalf of mining employees ) . In Reorganized CF&I Fabricators of Utah , Inc. , 518 U. S. 213 , we held that an exaction not only enforced by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue but even called a " tax " was in fact a penalty . " [ I]f the concept of penalty means anything , " we said , " it means punishment for an unlawful act or omission . " Id. , at 224 . See also Lipke v. Lederer , 259 U. S. 557 ( 1922 ) ( same ) . Moreover , while the penalty is assessed and collected by the IRS , § 5000A is administered both by that agency and by the Department of Health and Human Services ( and also the Secretary of Veteran Affairs ) , see § 5000A(e)(1)(D ) , ( e)(5 ) , ( f)(1)(A)(v ) , ( f)(1)(E ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) , which is responsible for defining its substantive scope — a feature that would be quite extraordinary for taxes .	unmatched
The Government points out that " [ t]he amount of the penalty will be calculated as a percentage of household income for federal income tax purposes , subject to a floor and [ a ] ca[p ] , " and that individuals who earn so little money that they " are not required to file income tax returns for the taxable year are not subject to the penalty " ( though they are , as we discussed earlier , subject to the mandate ) . Petitioners' Minimum Coverage Brief 12 , 53 . But varying a penalty according to ability to pay is an utterly familiar practice . See , e.g. , 33 U. S. C. § 1319(d ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) ( " In determining the amount of a civil penalty the court shall consider . . . the economic impact of the penalty on the violator " ) ; see also 6 U. S. C. § 488e(c ) ; 7 U. S. C. § § 7734(b)(2 ) , 8313(b)(2 ) ; 12 U. S. C. § § 1701q–1(d)(3 ) , 1723i(c)(3 ) , 1735f–14(c)(3 ) , 1735f–15(d)(3 ) , 4585(c)(2 ) ; 15 U. S. C. § § 45(m)(1)(C ) , 77h–1(g)(3 ) , 78u–2(d ) , 80a–9(d)(4 ) , 80b–3(i)(4 ) , 1681s(a)(2)(B ) , 1717a(b)(3 ) , 1825(b)(1 ) , 2615(a)(2)(B ) , 5408(b)(2 ) ; 33 U. S. C. § 2716a(a ) .	unmatched
The last of the feeble arguments in favor of petition - ers that we will address is the contention that what this statute repeatedly calls a penalty is in fact a tax because it contains no scienter requirement . The presence of such a requirement suggests a penalty — though one can imagine a tax imposed only on willful action ; but the absence of such a requirement does not suggest a tax . Penalties for absolute - liability offenses are commonplace . And where a statute is silent as to scienter , we traditionally presumea mens rea requirement if the statute imposes a " severe penalty . " Staples v. United States , 511 U. S. 600 , 618 ( 1994 ) . Since we have an entire jurisprudence addressing when it is that a scienter requirement should be inferred from a penalty , it is quite illogical to suggest that apenalty is not a penalty for want of an express scienterrequirement .	unmatched
And the nail in the coffin is that the mandate and penalty are located in Title I of the Act , its operative core , rather than where a tax would be found — in Title IX , containing the Act 's " Revenue Provisions . " In sum , " the terms of [ the ] act rende[r ] it unavoidable , " Parsons v. Bedford , 3 Pet . 433 , 448 ( 1830 ) , that Congress imposed a regulatory penalty , not a tax .	unmatched
For all these reasons , to say that the Individual Mandate merely imposes a tax is not to interpret the statute but to rewrite it . Judicial tax - writing is particularly troubl - ing . Taxes have never been popular , see , e.g. , Stamp Act of 1765 , and in part for that reason , the Constitution requires tax increases to originate in the House of Representatives . See Art . I , § 7 , cl . 1 . That is to say , they must originate in the legislative body most accountable to the people , where legislators must weigh the need for the tax against the terrible price they might pay at their next election , which is never more than two years off . The Federalist No . 58 " defend[ed ] the decision to give the origination power to the House on the ground that the Chamber that is more accountable to the people should have the primary role in raising revenue . " United States v. Munoz - Flores , 495 U. S. 385 , 395 ( 1990 ) . We have no doubt that Congress knew precisely what it was doing when it rejected an earlier version of this legislation that imposed a tax instead of a requirement - with - penalty . See Affordable Health Care for America Act , H. R. 3962 , 111th Cong . , 1st Sess . , § 501 ( 2009 ) ; America 's Healthy Future Act of 2009 , S. 1796 , 111th Cong . , 1st Sess . , § 1301 . Imposing a tax through judicial legislation inverts the constitutional scheme , and places the power to tax in the branch of government least accountable to the citizenry .	articlei#section7
Finally , we must observe that rewriting § 5000A as a tax in order to sustain its constitutionality would force us to confront a difficult constitutional question : whether this is a direct tax that must be apportioned among the States according to their population . Art . I , § 9 , cl . 4 . Perhaps it is not ( we have no need to address the point ) ; but the meaning of the Direct Tax Clause is famously unclear , and its application here is a question of first impression that deserves more thoughtful consideration than the lick - and - a - promise accorded by the Government and its supporters . The Government 's opening brief did not even address the question — perhaps because , until today , no federal court has accepted the implausible argument that § 5000A isan exercise of the tax power . And once respondents raised the issue , the Government devoted a mere 21 lines of its reply brief to the issue . Petitioners' Minimum Coverage Reply Brief 25 . At oral argument , the most prolonged statement about the issue was just over 50 words . Tr . of Oral Arg . 79 ( Mar. 27 , 2012 ) . One would expect this Court to demand more than fly - by - night briefing and argument before deciding a difficult constitutional question of first impression .	articlei#section8,articlei#section9
The Anti - Injunction Act	unmatched
There is another point related to the Individual Mandate that we must discuss — a point that logically should have been discussed first : Whether jurisdiction over the challenges to the minimum - coverage provision is precluded by the Anti - Injunction Act , which provides that " no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person , " 26 U. S. C. § 7421(a ) ( 2006 ed . ) .	unmatched
We have left the question to this point because it seemed to us that the dispositive question whether the minimum - coverage provision is a tax is more appropriately addressed in the significant constitutional context of whether it is an exercise of Congress' taxing power . Having found that it is not , we have no difficulty in deciding that these suits do not have " the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax . " 6	articlei#section8
The Government and those who support its position on this point make the remarkable argument that § 5000A is not a tax for purposes of the Anti - Injunction Act , see Brief for Petitioners in No . 11–398 ( Anti - Injunction Act ) , butis a tax for constitutional purposes , see Petitioners' Minimum Coverage Brief 52–62 . The rhetorical device that tries to cloak this argument in superficial plausibility is the same device employed in arguing that for constitutional purposes the minimum - coverage provision is a tax : confusing the question of what Congress did with the question of what Congress could have done . What qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Anti - Injunction Act , unlike what qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Constitution , is entirely within the control of Congress . Compare Bailey v. George , 259 U. S. 16 , 20 ( 1922 ) ( Anti - Injunction Act barred suit to restrain collections under the Child Labor Tax Law ) , with Child Labor Tax Case , 259 U. S. , at 36–41 ( holding the same law unconstitutional as exceeding Congress' taxing power ) . Congress could have defined " tax " for purposes of that statute in such fashion as to exclude some exactions that in fact are " taxes . " It might have prescribed , for example , that a particular exercise of the taxing power " shall not be regarded as a tax for purposes of the Anti - Injunction Act . " But there is no such prescription here . What the Government would have us believe inthese cases is that the very same textual indications that show this is not a tax under the Anti - Injunction Act show that it is a tax under the Constitution . That carries ver - bal wizardry too far , deep into the forbidden land of the sophists .	articlei#section8
The Medicaid Expansion	unmatched
We now consider respondents' second challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA , namely , that the Act 's dramatic expansion of the Medicaid program exceeds Congress' power to attach conditions to federal grants to the States .	unmatched
The ACA does not legally compel the States to participate in the expanded Medicaid program , but the Act authorizes a severe sanction for any State that refuses to go along : termination of all the State 's Medicaid funding . For the average State , the annual federal Medicaid subsidy is equal to more than one - fifth of the State 's expenditures . 7 A State forced out of the program would not only lose this huge sum but would almost certainly find it necessary to increase its own health - care expenditures substantially , requiring either a drastic reduction in funding for other programs or a large increase in state taxes . And these new taxes would come on top of the federal taxes already paid by the State 's citizens to fund the Medicaid program in other States .	unmatched
The States challenging the constitutionality of the ACA 's Medicaid Expansion contend that , for these practical reasons , the Act really does not give them any choice at all . As proof of this , they point to the goal and the struc - ture of the ACA . The goal of the Act is to provide near - universal medical coverage , 42 U. S. C. § 18091(2)(D ) , and without 100 % State participation in the Medicaid program , attainment of this goal would be thwarted . Even if States could elect to remain in the old Medicaid program , while declining to participate in the Expansion , there would be a gaping hole in coverage . And if a substantial number of States were entirely expelled from the program , the number of persons without coverage would be even higher .	unmatched
In light of the ACA 's goal of near - universal coverage , petitioners argue , if Congress had thought that anything less than 100 % state participation was a realistic possibility , Congress would have provided a backup scheme . But no such scheme is to be found anywhere in the more than 900 pages of the Act . This shows , they maintain , that Congress was certain that the ACA 's Medicaid offer was one that no State could refuse .	unmatched
In response to this argument , the Government contends that any congressional assumption about uniform state participation was based on the simple fact that the offerof federal funds associated with the expanded coverage is such a generous gift that no State would want to turn it down .	unmatched
To evaluate these arguments , we consider the extent of the Federal Government 's power to spend money and to attach conditions to money granted to the States .	articlei#section8
No one has ever doubted that the Constitution authorizes the Federal Government to spend money , but for many years the scope of this power was unsettled . The Constitution grants Congress the power to collect taxes " to . . . provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United States , " Art . I , § 8 , cl . 1 , and from " the foundation of the Nation sharp differences of opinion have persisted as to the true interpretation of the phrase " " the general welfare . " Butler , 297 U. S. , at 65 . Madison , it has been said , thought that the phrase " amounted to no more than a reference to the other powers enumerated in the subsequent clauses of the same section , " while Hamilton " maintained the clause confers a power separate and distinct from those later enumerated [ and ] is not restricted in meaning by the grant of them . " Ibid .	articlei#section8
The Court resolved this dispute in Butler . Writing for the Court , Justice Roberts opined that the Madisonian view would make Article I 's grant of the spending power a " mere tautology . " Ibid . To avoid that , he adopted Hamilton 's approach and found that " the power of Congress to authorize expenditure of public moneys for public purposes is not limited by the direct grants of legislative power found in the Constitution . " Id. , at 66 . Instead , he wrote , the spending power 's " confines are set in the clause which confers it , and not in those of section 8 which bestow and define the legislative powers of the Congress . " Ibid . ; see also Steward Machine Co. v. Davis , 301 U. S. 548–587 ( 1937 ) ; Helvering v. Davis , 301 U. S. 619 , 640 ( 1937 ) .	articlei#section8
The power to make any expenditure that furthers " the general welfare " is obviously very broad , and shortly after Butler was decided the Court gave Congress wide leeway to decide whether an expenditure qualifies . See Helvering , 301 U. S. , at 640–641 . " The discretion belongs to Congress , " the Court wrote , " unless the choice is clearly wrong , a display of arbitrary power , not an exercise of judgment . " Id. , at 640 . Since that time , the Court has never held that a federal expenditure was not for " the general welfare . "	articlei#section8
One way in which Congress may spend to promote the general welfare is by making grants to the States . Monetary grants , so - called grants - in - aid , became more frequent during the 1930 's , G. Stephens & N. Wikstrom , Ameri - can Intergovernmental Relations — A Fragmented Federal Polity 83 ( 2007 ) , and by 1950 they had reached $ 20 billion 8 or 11.6 % of state and local government expenditures from their own sources . 9 By 1970 this number had grown to $ 123.7 billion 10 or 29.1 % of state and local government expenditures from their own sources . 11 As of 2010 , fed - eral outlays to state and local governments came to over $ 608 billion or 37.5 % of state and local governmentexpenditures . 12	articlei#section8
When Congress makes grants to the States , it customarily attaches conditions , and this Court has long held that the Constitution generally permits Congress to do this . See Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman , 451 U. S. 1 , 17 ( 1981 ) ; South Dakota v. Dole , 483 U. S. 203 , 206 ( 1987 ) ; Fullilove v. Klutznick , 448 U. S. 448 , 474 ( 1980 ) ( opinion of Burger , C. J. ) ; Steward Machine , supra , at 593 .	unmatched
This practice of attaching conditions to federal fundsgreatly increases federal power . " [ O]bjectives not thought to be within Article I 's enumerated legislative fields , may nevertheless be attained through the use of the spending power and the conditional grant of federal funds . " Dole , supra , at 207 ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted ) ; see also College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed . Expense Bd . , 527 U. S. 666 , 686 ( 1999 ) ( by attaching conditions to federal funds , Congress may induce the States to " tak[e ] certain actions that Congress could not require them to take " ) .	articlei#section8
This formidable power , if not checked in any way , would present a grave threat to the system of federalism created by our Constitution . If Congress' " Spending Clause power to pursue objectives outside of Article I 's enumerated legislative fields , " Davis v. Monroe County Bd . of Ed . , 526 U. S. 629 , 654 ( 1999 ) ( Kennedy , J. , dissenting ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) , is " limited only by Congress' notion of the general welfare , the reality , given the vast financial resources of the Federal Government , is thatthe Spending Clause gives ‘ power to the Congress to tear down the barriers , to invade the states' jurisdiction , and to become a parliament of the whole people , subject to no restrictions save such as are self - imposed,' " Dole , supra , at 217 ( O'Connor , J. , dissenting ) ( quoting Butler , 297 U. S. , at 78 ) . " [ T]he Spending Clause power , if wielded without concern for the federal balance , has the potential to obliterate distinctions between national and local spheres of interest and power by permitting the Federal Government to set policy in the most sensitive areas of traditionalstate concern , areas which otherwise would lie outsideits reach . " Davis , supra , at 654–655 ( Kennedy , J.,dissenting ) .	articlei#section8
Recognizing this potential for abuse , our cases have long held that the power to attach conditions to grants to the States has limits . See , e.g. , Dole , supra , at 207–208 ; id.,at 207 ( spending power is " subject to several general re - strictions articulated in our cases " ) . For one thing , any such conditions must be unambiguous so that a State at least knows what it is getting into . See Pennhurst , supra , at 17 . Conditions must also be related " to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs , " Massachusetts v. United States , 435 U. S. 444 , 461 ( 1978 ) , and the conditional grant of federal funds may not " induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional , " Dole , supra , at 210 ; see Lawrence County v. Lead - Deadwood School Dist . No . 40–1 , 469 U. S.256 , 269–270 ( 1985 ) . Finally , while Congress may seek to induce States to accept conditional grants , Congress may not cross the " point at which pressure turns into compulsion , and ceases to be inducement . " Steward Machine , 301 U. S. , at 590 . Accord , College Savings Bank , supra , at 687 ; Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority v. Citizens for Abatement of Aircraft Noise , Inc. , 501 U. S. 252 , 285 ( 1991 ) ( White , J. , dissenting ) ; Dole , supra , at 211 .	unmatched
When federal legislation gives the States a real choice whether to accept or decline a federal aid package , the federal - state relationship is in the nature of a contractual relationship . See Barnes v. Gorman , 536 U. S. 181 , 186 ( 2002 ) ; Pennhurst , 451 U. S. , at 17 . And just as a contract is voidable if coerced , " [ t]he legitimacy of Congress' power to legislate under the spending power . . . rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the termsof the ‘ contract.' " Ibid . ( emphasis added ) . If a federal spending program coerces participation the States have not " exercise[d ] their choice"—let alone made an " informed choice . " Id. , at 17 , 25 .	articlei#section8
Coercing States to accept conditions risks the destruction of the " unique role of the States in our system . " Davis , supra , at 685 ( Kennedy , J. , dissenting ) . " [ T]he Constitution has never been understood to confer upon Congress the ability to require the States to govern according to Congress' instructions . " New York , 505 U. S. , at 162 . Congress may not " simply commandeer the legislative processes of the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program . " Id.,at 161 ( internal quotation marks and brackets omitted ) . Congress effectively engages in this impermissible compulsion when state participation in a federal spending program is coerced , so that the States' choice whether to enact or administer a federal regulatory program is rendered illusory .	unmatched
Where all Congress has done is to " encourag[e ] state regulation rather than compe[l ] it , state governments remain responsive to the local electorate 's preferences ; state officials remain accountable to the people . [ But ] where the Federal Government compels States to regulate , the accountability of both state and federal officials is diminished . " New York , supra , at 168 .	unmatched
Amici who support the Government argue that forcing state employees to implement a federal program is more respectful of federalism than using federal workers to implement that program . See , e.g. , Brief for Service Employees International Union et al . as Amici Curiae in No . 11–398 , pp . 25–26 . They note that Congress , instead of expanding Medicaid , could have established an entirely federal program to provide coverage for the same group of people . By choosing to structure Medicaid as a cooperative federal - state program , they contend , Congress allows for more state control . Ibid .	unmatched
This argument reflects a view of federalism that our cases have rejected — and with good reason . When Congress compels the States to do its bidding , it blurs the lines of political accountability . If the Federal Government makes a controversial decision while acting on its own , " it is the Federal Government that makes the decision in full view of the public , and it will be federal officials that suffer the consequences if the decision turns out to be detrimental or unpopular . " New York , 505 U. S. , at 168 . But when the Federal Government compels the States to take unpopular actions , " it may be state officials who will bear the brunt of public disapproval , while the federal officials who devised the regulatory program may remain insulated from the electoral ramifications of their decision . " Id. , at 169 ; see Printz , supra , at 930 . For this reason , federal officeholders may view this " departur[e ] from the federal structure to be in their personal interests . . . as a means of shifting responsibility for the eventual decision . " New York , 505 U. S. , at 182–183 . And even state officials may favor such a " departure from the constitutional plan , " since uncertainty concerning responsibility may also permit them to escape accountability . Id. , at 182 . If a program is popular , state officials may claim credit ; if it is unpopular , they may protest that they were merely responding to a federal directive .	unmatched
Once it is recognized that spending - power legislation can not coerce state participation , two questions remain : ( 1 ) What is the meaning of coercion in this context ? ( 2 ) Is the ACA 's expanded Medicaid coverage coercive ? We now turn to those questions .	unmatched
The answer to the first of these questions — the meaning of coercion in the present context — is straightforward . As we have explained , the legitimacy of attaching conditions to federal grants to the States depends on the voluntariness of the States' choice to accept or decline the offered package . Therefore , if States really have no choice other than to accept the package , the offer is coercive , and the conditions can not be sustained under the spending power . And as our decision in South Dakota v. Dole makes clear , theoretical voluntariness is not enough .	unmatched
In South Dakota v. Dole , we considered whether the spending power permitted Congress to condition 5 % of the State 's federal highway funds on the State 's adoption ofa minimum drinking age of 21 years . South Dakota argued that the program was impermissibly coercive , but we disagreed , reasoning that " Congress ha[d ] directed only that a State desiring to establish a minimum drinking age lower than 21 lose a relatively small percentage of certain federal highway funds . " 483 U. S. , at 211 . Because " all South Dakota would lose if she adhere[d ] to her chosen course as to a suitable minimum drinking age [ was ] 5%of the funds otherwise obtainable under specified high - way grant programs , " we found that " Congress ha[d ] of - fered relatively mild encouragement to the States to enact higher minimum drinking ages than they would otherwise choose . " Ibid . Thus , the decision whether to comply with the federal condition " remain[ed ] the prerogative of the States not merely in theory but in fact , " and so the program at issue did not exceed Congress' power . Id. , at 211–212 ( emphasis added ) .	articlei#section8
The question whether a law enacted under the spending power is coercive in fact will sometimes be difficult , but where Congress has plainly " crossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion , " New York , supra , at 175 , a federal program that coopts the States' political processes must be declared unconstitutional . " [ T]he federal balance is too essential a part of our constitutional structure and plays too vital a role in securing freedom for us to admit inability to intervene . " Lopez , 514 U. S. , at 578 ( Kennedy , J. , concurring ) .	articlei#section8
The Federal Government 's argument in this case at best pays lip service to the anticoercion principle . The Federal Government suggests that it is sufficient if States are " free , as a matter of law , to turn down " federal funds . Brief for Respondents in No . 11–400 , p. 17 ( emphasis added ) ; see also i d . , at 25 . According to the Federal Government , neither the amount of the offered federal funds nor the amount of the federal taxes extracted from the taxpayers of a State to pay for the program in question is relevant in determining whether there is impermissible coercion . Id. , at 41–46 .	unmatched
This argument ignores reality . When a heavy federal tax is levied to support a federal program that offers large grants to the States , States may , as a practical matter , be unable to refuse to participate in the federal program and to substitute a state alternative . Even if a State believes that the federal program is ineffective and inefficient , withdrawal would likely force the State to impose a huge tax increase on its residents , and this new state tax would come on top of the federal taxes already paid by residents to support subsidies to participating States . 13	unmatched
Acceptance of the Federal Government 's interpreta - tion of the anticoercion rule would permit Congress to dic - tate policy in areas traditionally governed primarily at the state or local level . Suppose , for example , that Congress enacted legislation offering each State a grant equal to the State 's entire annual expenditures for primary and secondary education . Suppose also that this funding came with conditions governing such things as school curriculum , the hiring and tenure of teachers , the drawing of school districts , the length and hours of the school day , theschool calendar , a dress code for students , and rules for student discipline . As a matter of law , a State could turn down that offer , but if it did so , its residents would not only be required to pay the federal taxes needed to support this expensive new program , but they would also be forced to pay an equivalent amount in state taxes . And if the State gave in to the federal law , the State and its subdivisions would surrender their traditional authority in the field of education . Asked at oral argument whether sucha law would be allowed under the spending power , the Solicitor General responded that it would . Tr . of Oral Arg . 44–45 ( Mar. 28 , 2012 ) .	articlei#section8

Whether federal spending legislation crosses the line from enticement to coercion is often difficult to determine , and courts should not conclude that legislation is unconstitutional on this ground unless the coercive nature of an offer is unmistakably clear . In this case , however , there can be no doubt . In structuring the ACA , Congress unambiguously signaled its belief that every State would have no real choice but to go along with the Medicaid Expansion . If the anticoercion rule does not apply in this case , then there is no such rule .	unmatched
The dimensions of the Medicaid program lend strong support to the petitioner States' argument that refusing to accede to the conditions set out in the ACA is not a realistic option . Before the ACA 's enactment , Medicaid funded medical care for pregnant women , families with dependents , children , the blind , the elderly , and the disabled . See 42 U. S. C. § 1396a(a)(10 ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) . The ACA greatly expands the program 's reach , making new funds available to States that agree to extend coverage to all individuals who are under age 65 and have incomes below 133 % of the federal poverty line . See § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII ) . Any State that refuses to expandits Medicaid programs in this way is threatened with a severe sanction : the loss of all its federal Medicaid funds . See § 1396c ( 2006 ed . ) .	unmatched
Medicaid has long been the largest federal program of grants to the States . See Brief for Respondents in No . 11–400 , at 37 . In 2010 , the Federal Government directed more than $ 552 billion in federal funds to the States . See Nat . Assn . of State Budget Officers , 2010 State Expenditure Report : Examining Fiscal 2009–2011 State Spending , p. 7 ( 2011 ) ( NASBO Report ) . Of this , more than $ 233 billion went to pre - expansion Medicaid . See i d . , at 47 . 14 This amount equals nearly 22 % of all state expenditures combined . See i d . , at 7 .	unmatched
The States devote a larger percentage of their budgetsto Medicaid than to any other item . Id. , at 5 . Federal funds account for anywhere from 50 % to 83 % of each State 's total Medicaid expenditures , see § 1396d(b ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) ; most States receive more than $ 1 billion in federal Medicaid funding ; and a quarter receive more than$5 billion , NASBO Report 47 . These federal dollars total nearly two thirds—64.6%—of all Medicaid expenditures nationwide . 15 Id. , at 46 .	unmatched
The Court of Appeals concluded that the States failed to establish coercion in this case in part because the " states have the power to tax and raise revenue , and therefore can create and fund programs of their own if they do not like Congress 's terms . " 648 F. 3d 1235 , 1268 ( CA11 2011 ) ; see Brief for Sen. Harry Reid et al . as Amici Curiae in No . 11–400 , p. 21 ( " States may always choose to decrease expenditures on other programs or to raise revenues " ) . But the sheer size of this federal spending program in relation to state expenditures means that a State would be very hard pressed to compensate for the loss of federal funds by cutting other spending or raising additional revenue . Arizona , for example , commits 12 % of its state expenditures to Medicaid , and relies on the Federal Government to provide the rest : $ 5.6 billion , equaling roughly one - third of Arizona 's annual state expenditures of $ 17 billion . See NASBO Report 7 , 47 . Therefore , if Arizona lost federal Medicaid funding , the State would have to commit an additional 33 % of all its state expenditures to fund an equivalent state program along the lines of pre - expansion Medicaid . This means that the State would have to allocate 45 % of its annual expenditures for that one purpose . See ibid .	unmatched
The States are far less reliant on federal funding for any other program . After Medicaid , the next biggest federalfunding item is aid to support elementary and secondary education , which amounts to 12.8 % of total federal outlays to the States , see i d . , at 7 , 16 , and equals only 6.6 % ofall state expenditures combined . See ibid . In Arizona , for example , although federal Medicaid expenditures are equal to 33 % of all state expenditures , federal education funds amount to only 9.8 % of all state expenditures . See ibid . And even in States with less than average federal Medicaid funding , that funding is at least twice the size of federal education funding as a percentage of state expenditures . Id. , at 7 , 16 , 47 .	unmatched
A State forced out of the Medicaid program would face burdens in addition to the loss of federal Medicaid funding . For example , a nonparticipating State might be found to be ineligible for other major federal funding sources , such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) , which is premised on the expectation that States will participate in Medicaid . See 42 U. S. C. § 602(a)(3 ) ( 2006 ed . ) ( requiring that certain beneficiaries of TANF funds be " eligible for medical assistance under the State [ 's Medicaid ] plan " ) . And withdrawal or expulsion from the Medicaid program would not relieve a State 's hospitals of their obligation under federal law to provide care for patients who are unable to pay for medical services . The Emer - gency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act , § 1395dd , requires hospitals that receive any federal funding to provide stabilization care for indigent patients but does not offer federal funding to assist facilities in carrying out its mandate . Many of these patients are now covered by Medicaid . If providers could not look to the Medicaid program to pay for this care , they would find it exceed - ingly difficult to comply with federal law unless they were given substantial state support . See , e.g. , Brief for Economists as Amici Curiae in No 11–400 , p. 11 .	unmatched
For these reasons , the offer that the ACA makes to the States — go along with a dramatic expansion of Medicaid or potentially lose all federal Medicaid funding — is quite unlike anything that we have seen in a prior spending - power case . In South Dakota v. Dole , the total amount that the States would have lost if every single Statehad refused to comply with the 21-year - old drinkingage was approximately $ 614.7 million — or about 0.19%of all state expenditures combined . See Nat . Assn.of State Budget Officers , 1989 ( Fiscal Years 1987–1989 Data ) State Expenditure Report 10 , 84 ( 1989 ) , http://www.nasbo.org/publications-data/state-expenditure-report/archives . South Dakota stood to lose , at most , funding that amounted to less than 1 % of its annual state expenditures . See ibid . Under the ACA , by contrast , the Federal Government has threatened to withhold 42.3 % of all federal outlays to the states , or approximately $ 233 billion . See NASBO Report 7 , 10 , 47 . South Dakota stands to lose federal funding equaling 28.9 % of its annual state expenditures . See i d . , at 7 , 47 . Withholding $ 614.7 million , equaling only 0.19 % of all state expenditures combined , is aptly characterized as " relatively mild encouragement , " but threatening to withhold $ 233 billion , equaling 21.86 % of all state expenditures combined , is a different matter .	articlei#section8
What the statistics suggest is confirmed by the goaland structure of the ACA . In crafting the ACA , Congress clearly expressed its informed view that no State could possibly refuse the offer that the ACA extends .	unmatched
The stated goal of the ACA is near - universal health care coverage . To achieve this goal , the ACA mandates that every person obtain a minimum level of coverage . It attempts to reach this goal in several different ways . The guaranteed issue and community - rating provisions are designed to make qualifying insurance available and affordable for persons with medical conditions that may require expensive care . Other ACA provisions seek to make such policies more affordable for people of modest means . Finally , for low - income individuals who aresimply not able to obtain insurance , Congress expanded Medicaid , transforming it from a program covering only members of a limited list of vulnerable groups into a program that provides at least the requisite minimum levelof coverage for the poor . See 42 U. S. C. § § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) , 1396u–7(a ) , ( b)(5 ) , 18022(a ) . This design was intended to provide at leasta specified minimum level of coverage for all Americans , but the achievement of that goal obviously depends on participation by every single State . If any State — notto mention all of the 26 States that brought this suit — chose to decline the federal offer , there would be a gaping hole in the ACA 's coverage .	unmatched
It is true that some persons who are eligible for Medicaid coverage under the ACA may be able to secure private insurance , either through their employers or by obtain - ing subsidized insurance through an exchange . See 26 U. S. C. § 36B(a ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) ; Brief for Respondents in No . 11–400 , at 12 . But the new federal subsidies are not available to those whose income is below the federal poverty level , and the ACA provides no means , other than Medicaid , for these individuals to obtain coverage and comply with the Mandate . The Government counters that these people will not have to pay the penalty , see , e.g. , Tr . of Oral Arg . 68 ( Mar. 28 , 2012 ) ; Brief for Respondents in No . 11–400 , at 49–50 , but that argument misses the point : Without Medicaid , these individuals will not have coverage and the ACA 's goal of near - universal coverage will be severely frustrated .	unmatched
If Congress had thought that States might actually refuse to go along with the expansion of Medicaid , Congress would surely have devised a backup scheme so that the most vulnerable groups in our society , those previously eligible for Medicaid , would not be left out in the cold . But nowhere in the over 900-page Act is such a scheme to be found . By contrast , because Congress thought that some States might decline federal funding for the operation ofa " health benefit exchange , " Congress provided a backup scheme ; if a State declines to participate in the operation of an exchange , the Federal Government will step inand operate an exchange in that State . See 42 U. S. C. § 18041(c)(1 ) . Likewise , knowing that States would not necessarily provide affordable health insurance for aliens lawfully present in the United States — because Medicaid does not require States to provide such coverage — Con - gress extended the availability of the new federal insurance subsidies to all aliens . See 26 U. S. C. § 36B(c)(1)(B)(ii ) ( excepting from the income limit individualswho are " not eligible for the medicaid program . . . by reason of [ their ] alien status " ) . Congress did not make these subsidies available for citizens with incomes below the poverty level because Congress obviously assumed that they would be covered by Medicaid . If Congress had contemplated that some of these citizens would be left without Medicaid coverage as a result of a State 's withdrawal or expulsion from the program , Congress surely would have made them eligible for the tax subsidies provided for low - income aliens .	unmatched
These features of the ACA convey an unmistakable message : Congress never dreamed that any State would refuse to go along with the expansion of Medicaid . Congress well understood that refusal was not a practical option .	unmatched
The Federal Government does not dispute the inference that Congress anticipated 100 % state participation , but it argues that this assumption was based on the fact that ACA 's offer was an " exceedingly generous " gift . Brief for Respondents in No . 11–400 , at 50 . As the Federal Government sees things , Congress is like the generous benefactor who offers $ 1 million with few strings attached to50 randomly selected individuals . Just as this benefactor might assume that all of these 50 individuals would snap up his offer , so Congress assumed that every State would gratefully accept the federal funds ( and conditions ) to go with the expansion of Medicaid .	unmatched
This characterization of the ACA 's offer raises obvious questions . If that offer is " exceedingly generous , " as the Federal Government maintains , why have more than half the States brought this lawsuit , contending that the offer is coercive ? And why did Congress find it necessary to threaten that any State refusing to accept this " exceed - ingly generous " gift would risk losing all Medicaid funds ? Congress could have made just the new funding provided under the ACA contingent on acceptance of the terms of the Medicaid Expansion . Congress took such an approach in some earlier amendments to Medicaid , separating new coverage requirements and funding from the rest of the program so that only new funding was conditioned on new eligibility extensions . See , e.g. , Social Security Amendments of 1972 , 86Stat . 1465 .	unmatched
Congress' decision to do otherwise here reflects its understanding that the ACA offer is not an " exceedingly generous " gift that no State in its right mind would decline . Instead , acceptance of the offer will impose very substantial costs on participating States . It is true that the Federal Government will bear most of the initial costs associated with the Medicaid Expansion , first paying 100 % of the costs of covering newly eligible individuals between 2014 and 2016 . 42 U. S. C. § 1396d(y ) . But that is just part of the picture . Participating States will be forced to shoulder substantial costs as well , because after 2019 the Federal Government will cover only 90 % of the costs associated with the Expansion , see ibid . , with state spending projected to increase by at least $ 20 billion by 2020 as a consequence . Statement of Douglas W. Elmendorf , CBO 's Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation Enacted in March 2010 , p. 24 ( Mar. 30 , 2011 ) ; see also R. Bovbjerg , B. Ormond , & V. Chen , Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured , State Budgets under Federal Health Reform : The Extent and Causes of Variations in Estimated Impacts 4 , n. 27 ( Feb. 2011 ) ( estimating new state spending at $ 43.2 billion through 2019 ) . After 2019 , state spending is expected to increase at a faster rate ; the CBO estimates new state spending at $ 60 billion through 2021 . Statement of Douglas W. Elmendorf , supra , at 24 . And these costs may increase in the future because ofthe very real possibility that the Federal Government will change funding terms and reduce the percentage of funds it will cover . This would leave the States to bear an increasingly large percentage of the bill . See Tr . of OralArg . 74–76 ( Mar. 28 , 2012 ) . Finally , after 2015 , the States will have to pick up the tab for 50 % of all administrative costs associated with implementing the new program , see § § 1396b(a)(2)–(5 ) , ( 7 ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) , costs that could approach $ 12 billion between fiscal years 2014 and 2020 , see Dept . of Health and Human Services , Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services , 2010 Actuarial Report on the Financial Outlook for Medicaid 30 .	unmatched
In sum , it is perfectly clear from the goal and structure of the ACA that the offer of the Medicaid Expansion was one that Congress understood no State could refuse . The Medicaid Expansion therefore exceeds Congress' spending power and can not be implemented .	articlei#section8

Seven Members of the Court agree that the Medicaid Expansion , as enacted by Congress , is unconstitutional . See Part IV – A to IV – E , supra ; Part IV – A , ante , at 45–55 ( opinion of Roberts , C. J. , joined by Breyer and Kagan , JJ . ) . Because the Medicaid Expansion is unconstitutional , the question of remedy arises . The most natural remedy would be to invalidate the Medicaid Expansion . However , the Government proposes — in two cursory sentences atthe very end of its brief — preserving the Expansion . Under its proposal , States would receive the additional Medi - caid funds if they expand eligibility , but States wouldkeep their pre - existing Medicaid funds if they do notexpand eligibility . We can not accept the Government'ssuggestion .	unmatched
The reality that States were given no real choice but to expand Medicaid was not an accident . Congress assumed States would have no choice , and the ACA depends on States' having no choice , because its Mandate requires low - income individuals to obtain insurance many of them can afford only through the Medicaid Expansion . Furthermore , a State 's withdrawal might subject everyone in the State to much higher insurance premiums . That is because the Medicaid Expansion will no longer offset the cost to the insurance industry imposed by the ACA 's insurance regulations and taxes , a point that is explained in more detail in the severability section below . To make the Medicaid Expansion optional despite the ACA 's structure and design " ‘ would be to make a new law , not to enforce an old one . This is no part of our duty.' " Trade - Mark Cases , 100 U. S. 82 , 99 ( 1879 ) .	unmatched
Worse , the Government 's proposed remedy introduces a new dynamic : States must choose between expanding Medicaid or paying huge tax sums to the federal fisc for the sole benefit of expanding Medicaid in other States . If this divisive dynamic between and among States can be introduced at all , it should be by conscious congressional choice , not by Court - invented interpretation . We do not doubt that States are capable of making decisions when put in a tight spot . We do doubt the authority of this Court to put them there .	unmatched
The Government cites a severability clause codified with Medicaid in Chapter 7 of the United States Code stating that if " any provision of this chapter , or the application thereof to any person or circumstance , is held invalid , the remainder of the chapter , and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby . " 42 U. S. C. § 1303 ( 2006 ed . ) . But that clause tells us only that other provisions in Chapter 7 should not be invalidated if § 1396c , the authorization for the cut - off of all Medicaid funds , is unconstitutional . It does not tell us that § 1396c can be judicially revised , to say what it does not say . Such a judicial power wouldnot be called the doctrine of severability but perhapsthe doctrine of amendatory invalidation — similar to the amendatory veto that permits the Governors of some States to reduce the amounts appropriated in legislation . The proof that such a power does not exist is the fact that it would not preserve other congressional dispositions , but would leave it up to the Court what the " validated " legislation will contain . The Court today opts for permitting the cut - off of only incremental Medicaid funding , but it might just as well have permitted , say , the cut - off of funds that represent no more than x percent of the State 's bud - get . The Court severs nothing , but simply revises § 1396c to read as the Court would desire .	unmatched
We should not accept the Government 's invitation to attempt to solve a constitutional problem by rewriting the Medicaid Expansion so as to allow States that reject itto retain their pre - existing Medicaid funds . Worse , the Government 's remedy , now adopted by the Court , takes the ACA and this Nation in a new direction and charts a course for federalism that the Court , not the Congress , has chosen ; but under the Constitution , that power and authority do not rest with this Court .	unmatched

The Affordable Care Act seeks to achieve " near - universal " health insurance coverage . § 18091(2)(D ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) . The two pillars of the Act are the Individ - ual Mandate and the expansion of coverage under Medicaid . In our view , both these central provisions of the Act — the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion — are invalid . It follows , as some of the parties urge , that all other provisions of the Act must fall as well . The following section explains the severability principles that require this conclusion . This analysis also shows how closely interrelated the Act is , and this is all the more reason why it is judicial usurpation to impose an entirely new mechanism for withdrawal of Medicaid funding , see Part IV – F , supra , which is one of many examples of how rewriting the Act alters its dynamics .	unmatched
When an unconstitutional provision is but a part of a more comprehensive statute , the question arises as to the validity of the remaining provisions . The Court 's authority to declare a statute partially unconstitutional has been well established since Marbury v. Madison , 1 Cranch 137 ( 1803 ) , when the Court severed an unconstitutional provision from the Judiciary Act of 1789 . And while the Court has sometimes applied " at least a modest presumption in favor of . . . severability , " C. Nelson , Statutory Interpretation 144 ( 2010 ) , it has not always done so , see , e.g. , Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians , 526 U. S. 172–195 ( 1999 ) .	unmatched
An automatic or too cursory severance of statutory provisions risks " rewrit[ing ] a statute and giv[ing ] it an effect altogether different from that sought by the measure viewed as a whole . " Railroad Retirement Bd . v. Alton R. Co. , 295 U. S. 330 , 362 ( 1935 ) . The Judiciary , if it orders uncritical severance , then assumes the legislative function ; for it imposes on the Nation , by the Court 's decree , its own new statutory regime , consisting of policies , risks , and duties that Congress did not enact . That can be a more extreme exercise of the judicial power than striking the whole statute and allowing Congress to address the conditions that pertained when the statute was considered at the outset .	unmatched
The Court has applied a two - part guide as the framework for severability analysis . The test has been deemed " well established . " Alaska Airlines , Inc. v. Brock , 480 U. S. 678 , 684 ( 1987 ) . First , if the Court holds a statutory provision unconstitutional , it then determines whetherthe now truncated statute will operate in the manner Con - gress intended . If not , the remaining provisions must be invalidated . See i d . , at 685 . In Alaska Airlines , the Court clarified that this first inquiry requires more than ask - ing whether " the balance of the legislation is incapable of functioning independently . " Id. , at 684 . Even if the remaining provisions will operate in some coherent way , that alone does not save the statute . The question is whether the provisions will work as Congress intended . The " relevant inquiry in evaluating severability is whether the statute will function in a manner consistent withthe intent of Congress . " Id. , at 685 ( emphasis in original ) . See also Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd . , 561 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2010 ) ( slip op . , at28 ) ( the Act " remains fully operative as a law with these tenure restrictions excised " ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ; United States v. Booker , 543 U. S. 220 , 227 ( 2005 ) ( " [ T]wo provisions . . . must be invalidated in order to allow the statute to operate in a manner consistentwith congressional intent " ) ; Mille Lacs , supra , at 194 ( " [ E]m - bodying as it did one coherent policy , [ the entire order]is inseverable " ) .	unmatched
Second , even if the remaining provisions can operate as Congress designed them to operate , the Court must determine if Congress would have enacted them standing alone and without the unconstitutional portion . If Congress would not , those provisions , too , must be invalidated . See Alaska Airlines , supra , at 685 ( " [ T]he unconstitu - tional provision must be severed unless the statute cre - ated in its absence is legislation that Congress would not have enacted " ) ; see also Free Enterprise Fund , supra , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 29 ) ( " [ N]othing in the statute 's text or historical context makes it ‘ evident' that Congress , faced with the limitations imposed by the Constitution , would have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose members are removable at will " ) ; Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng . , 546 U. S. 320 , 330 ( 2006 ) ( " Would the legislature have preferred what is left of its statute to no statute at all " ) ; Denver Area Ed . Telecommunications Consortium , Inc. v. FCC , 518 U. S. 727 , 767 ( 1996 ) ( plurality opinion ) ( " Would Congress still have passed § 10(a ) had it known that the remaining provisions were invalid " ( internal quotation marks and brackets omitted ) ) .	unmatched
The two inquiries — whether the remaining provisions will operate as Congress designed them , and whether Congress would have enacted the remaining provisions standing alone — often are interrelated . In the ordinary course , if the remaining provisions can not operate according to the congressional design ( the first inquiry ) , it almost necessarily follows that Congress would not have enacted them ( the second inquiry ) . This close interaction may explain why the Court has not always been precise in distinguishing between the two . There are , however , occasions in which the severability standard 's first inquiry ( statutory functionality ) is not a proxy for the second inquiry ( whether the Legislature intended the remaining provisions to stand alone ) .	unmatched
The Act was passed to enable affordable , " near - universal"health insurance coverage . 42 U. S. C. § 18091(2)(D).The resulting , complex statute consists of mandates and other requirements ; comprehensive regulation and penalties ; some undoubted taxes ; and increases in some governmental expenditures , decreases in others . Under the severability test set out above , it must be determined if those provisions function in a coherent way and as Congress would have intended , even when the major provisions establishing the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion are themselves invalid .	unmatched
Congress did not intend to establish the goal of near - universal coverage without regard to fiscal consequences . See , e.g. , ACA § 1563 , 124Stat . 270 ( " [ T]his Act will reduce the Federal deficit between 2010 and 2019 " ) . And it did not intend to impose the inevitable costs on any one industry or group of individuals . The whole design of the Actis to balance the costs and benefits affecting each setof regulated parties . Thus , individuals are required to obtain health insurance . See 26 U. S. C. § 5000A(a ) . Insur - ance companies are required to sell them insurance regardless of patients' pre - existing conditions and to comply with a host of other regulations . And the companies must pay new taxes . See § 4980I ( high - cost insurance plans);42 U. S. C. § § 300gg(a)(1 ) , 300gg–4(b ) ( community rating ) ; § § 300gg–1 , 300gg–3 , 300gg–4(a ) ( guaranteed issue ) ; § 300gg–11 ( elimination of coverage limits ) ; § 300gg–14(a ) ( dependent children up to age 26 ) ; ACA § § 9010 , 10905 , 124Stat . 865 , 1017 ( excise tax ) ; Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ( HCERA ) § 1401 , 124Stat . 1059 ( excise tax ) . States are expected to expand Medicaid eligibility and to create regulated marketplaces called ex - changes where individuals can purchase insurance . See 42 U. S. C. § § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) ( Medicaid Expansion ) , 18031 ( exchanges ) . Some persons who can not afford insurance are provided it through the Medicaid Expansion , and others are aided in their purchase of insurance through federal subsidies available on health - insurance exchanges . See 26 U. S. C. § 36B ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) , 42 U. S. C. § 18071 ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) ( federal subsidies ) . The Federal Government 's increased spending is offset by new taxes and cuts in other federal expenditures , including reductions in Medicare and in federal payments to hospitals . See , e.g. , § 1395ww(r ) ( Medicare cuts ) ; ACA Title IX , Subtitle A , 124Stat . 847 ( " Rev - enue Offset Provisions " ) . Employers with at least 50employees must either provide employees with adequate health benefits or pay a financial exaction if an employee who qualifies for federal subsidies purchases insurance through an exchange . See 26 U. S. C. § 4980H ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) .	unmatched
In short , the Act attempts to achieve near - universal health insurance coverage by spreading its costs to individuals , insurers , governments , hospitals , and employers — while , at the same time , offsetting significant portionsof those costs with new benefits to each group . For ex - ample , the Federal Government bears the burden of paying billions for the new entitlements mandated by the Medicaid Expansion and federal subsidies for insurance purchases on the exchanges ; but it benefits from reductions in the reimbursements it pays to hospitals . Hospitals lose those reimbursements ; but they benefit from the decrease in uncompensated care , for under the insurance regulations it is easier for individuals with pre - existing conditions to purchase coverage that increases payments to hospitals . Insurance companies bear new costs imposed by a collection of insurance regulations and taxes , including " guaranteed issue " and " community rating " requirements to give coverage regardless of the insured 's pre - existing conditions ; but the insurers benefit from the new , healthy purchasers who are forced by the Individual Mandateto buy the insurers' product and from the new low - income Medicaid recipients who will enroll in insurance companies' Medicaid - funded managed care programs . In summary , the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion offset insurance regulations and taxes , which offset reduced reimbursements to hospitals , which offset increases in federal spending . So , the Act 's major provisions are interdependent .	unmatched
The Act then refers to these interdependencies as " shared responsibility . " See ACA Subtitle F , Title I , 124Stat . 242 ( " Shared Responsibility " ) ; ACA § 1501 , ibid . ( same ) ; ACA § 1513 , i d . , at 253 ( same ) ; ACA § 4980H , ibid . ( same ) . In at least six places , the Act describes the Individual Mandate as working " together with the other pro - visions of this Act . " 42 U. S. C. § 18091(2)(C ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) ( working " together " to " add millions of new consumers to the health insurance market " ) ; § 18091(2)(E ) ( working " together " to " significantly reduce " the economic cost of the poorer health and shorter lifespan of the uninsured ) ; § 18091(2)(F ) ( working " together " to " lower health insurance premiums " ) ; § 18091(2)(G ) ( working " together " to " improve financial security for families " ) ; § 18091(2)(I ) ( working " together " to minimize " adverse selection and broaden the health insurance risk pool to include healthy individuals " ) ; § 18091(2)(J ) ( working " together " to " signif - icantly reduce administrative costs and lower health insurance premiums " ) . The Act calls the Individual Mandate " an essential part " of federal regulation of health insurance and warns that " the absence of the requirement would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance market . " § 18091(2)(H ) .	unmatched
One preliminary point should be noted before applying severability principles to the Act . To be sure , an argument can be made that those portions of the Act that none of the parties has standing to challenge can not be held nonseverable . The response to this argument is that our cases do not support it . See , e.g. , Williams v. Standard Oil Co. of La. , 278 U. S. 235–244 ( 1929 ) ( holding nonseverable statutory provisions that did not burden the parties ) . It would be particularly destructive of sound government to apply such a rule with regard to a multifaceted piece of legislation like the ACA . It would take years , perhaps decades , for each of its provisions to be adjudicated separately — and for some of them ( those simply expending federal funds ) no one may have separate standing . The Federal Government , the States , and private parties ought to know at once whether the entire legislation fails .	unmatched
The opinion now explains in Part V – C–1 , infra , why the Act 's major provisions are not severable from the Mandate and Medicaid Expansion . It proceeds from the insurance regulations and taxes ( C–1–a ) , to the reductions in reimbursements to hospitals and other Medicare reductions ( C–1–b ) , the exchanges and their federal subsidies ( C–1–c ) , and the employer responsibility assessment ( C–1–d).Part V – C–2 , infra , explains why the Act 's minor provisions also are not severable .	unmatched
The Act 's Major Provisions	unmatched
Major provisions of the Affordable Care Act — i.e . , the insurance regulations and taxes , the reductions in federal reimbursements to hospitals and other Medicare spend - ing reductions , the exchanges and their federal subsidies , and the employer responsibility assessment — cannot remain once the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion are invalid . That result follows from the undoubted inability of the other major provisions to operate as Congress intended without the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion . Absent the invalid portions , the other major provisions could impose enormous risks of unexpected bur - dens on patients , the health - care community , and the federal budget . That consequence would be in absolute conflict with the ACA 's design of " shared responsibility , " and would pose a threat to the Nation that Congress did not intend .	unmatched
Insurance Regulations and Taxes	unmatched
Without the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion , the Affordable Care Act 's insurance regulations and insurance taxes impose risks on insurance companies and their customers that this Court can not measure . Those risks would undermine Congress' scheme of " shared responsibility . " See 26 U. S. C. § 4980I ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) ( high - cost insurance plans ) ; 42 U. S. C. § § 300gg(a)(1 ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) , 300gg–4(b ) ( community rating ) ; § § 300gg–1 , 300gg–3 , 300gg–4(a ) ( guaranteed issue ) ; § 300gg–11 ( elimination of coverage limits ) ; § 300gg–14(a ) ( dependent children up to age 26 ) ; ACA § § 9010 , 10905 , 124Stat . 865 , 1017 ( excise tax ) ; HCERA § 1401 , 124Stat . 1059 ( excise tax ) .	unmatched
The Court has been informed by distinguished economists that the Act 's Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion would each increase revenues to the insurance industry by about $ 350 billion over 10 years ; that this combined figure of $ 700 billion is necessary to offset the approximately $ 700 billion in new costs to the insurance industry imposed by the Act 's insurance regulations and taxes ; and that the new $ 700-billion burden would otherwise dwarf the industry 's current profit margin . See Brief for Economists as Amici Curiae in No . 11–393 etc . ( Severability ) , pp . 9–16 , 10a .	unmatched
If that analysis is correct , the regulations and taxes will mean higher costs for insurance companies . Higher costs may mean higher premiums for consumers , despite the Act 's goal of " lower[ing ] health insurance premiums . " 42 U. S. C. § 18091(2)(F ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) . Higher costs also could threaten the survival of health - insurance companies , despite the Act 's goal of " effective health insurance markets . " § 18091(2)(J ) .	unmatched
The actual cost of the regulations and taxes may be more or less than predicted . What is known , however , is that severing other provisions from the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion necessarily would impose significant risks and real uncertainties on insurance companies , their customers , all other major actors in the sys - tem , and the government treasury . And what also is known is this : Unnecessary risks and avoidable uncertainties are hostile to economic progress and fiscal stability and thus to the safety and welfare of the Nation and the Nation 's freedom . If those risks and uncertainties are to be imposed , it must not be by the Judiciary .	unmatched
Reductions in Reimbursements to Hospitals and Other Reductions in Medicare Expenditures	unmatched
The Affordable Care Act reduces payments by the Federal Government to hospitals by more than $ 200 billion over 10 years . See 42 U. S. C. § 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(xi)–(xii ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) ; § 1395ww(q ) ; § 1395ww(r ) ; § 1396r–4(f)(7 ) .	unmatched
The concept is straightforward : Near - universal coverage will reduce uncompensated care , which will increase hospitals' revenues , which will offset the government 's re - ductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals . Responsibility will be shared , as burdens and benefits balance each other . This is typical of the whole dynamic of the Act .	unmatched
Invalidating the key mechanisms for expanding insurance coverage , such as community rating and the Medicaid Expansion , without invalidating the reductions in Medicare and Medicaid , distorts the ACA 's design of " shared responsibility . " Some hospitals may be forced to raise the cost of care in order to offset the reductions in reimbursements , which could raise the cost of insurance premiums , in contravention of the Act 's goal of " lower[ing ] health insurance premiums . " 42 U. S. C. § 18091(2)(F ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) . See also § 18091(2)(I ) ( goal of"lower[ing ] health insurance premiums " ) ; § 18091(2)(J ) ( same ) . Other hospitals , particularly safety - net hospitals that serve a large number of uninsured patients , may be forced to shut down . Cf . National Assn . of Public Hospitals , 2009 Annual Survey : Safety Net Hospitals and Health Systems Fulfill Mission in Uncertain Times 5–6 ( Feb. 2011 ) . Like the effect of preserving the insurance regulations and taxes , the precise degree of risk to hospitals is unknowable . It is not the proper role of the Court , by severing part of a statute and allowing the rest to stand , to impose unknowable risks that Congress could neither measure nor predict . And Congress could not have intended that result in any event .	unmatched
There is a second , independent reason why the reductions in reimbursements to hospitals and the ACA 's other Medicare cuts must be invalidated . The ACA 's $ 455 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings offset the $ 434-billion cost of the Medicaid Expansion . See CBO Estimate , Table 2 ( Mar. 20 , 2010 ) . The reductions allowed Congress to find that the ACA " will reduce the Federal deficit between 2010 and 2019 " and " will continue to reduce budget deficits after 2019 . " ACA § § 1563(a)(1 ) , ( 2 ) , 124Stat . 270 .	unmatched
That finding was critical to the ACA . The Act 's " shared responsibility " concept extends to the federal budget . Congress chose to offset new federal expenditures with budget cuts and tax increases . That is why the United States has explained in the course of this litigation that " [ w]hen Congress passed the ACA , it was careful to ensure that any increased spending , including on Medicaid , was offset by other revenue - raising and cost - saving provisions . " Memorandum in Support of Government 's Motion for Summary Judgment in No . 3–10–cv–91 , p. 41 .	unmatched
If the Medicare and Medicaid reductions would no longer be needed to offset the costs of the Medicaid Expansion , the reductions would no longer operate in the manner Congress intended . They would lose their justification and foundation . In addition , to preserve them would be " to eliminate a significant quid pro quo of the legislative com - promise " and create a statute Congress did not enact . Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez , 531 U. S. 533 , 561 ( 2001 ) ( Scalia , J. , dissenting ) . It is no secret that cutting Medicare is unpopular ; and it is most improbable Congress would have done so without at least the assurance that it would render the ACA deficit - neutral . See ACA § § 1563(a)(1 ) , ( 2 ) , 124Stat . 270 .	unmatched

Health Insurance Exchanges and Their Federal Subsidies	unmatched
The ACA requires each State to establish a health - insurance " exchange . " Each exchange is a one - stop marketplace for individuals and small businesses to compare community - rated health insurance and purchase the policy of their choice . The exchanges can not operate in the manner Congress intended if the Individual Mandate , Medicaid Expansion , and insurance regulations can not remain in force .	unmatched
The Act 's design is to allocate billions of federal dollars to subsidize individuals' purchases on the exchanges . In - dividuals with incomes between 100 and 400 percent of the poverty level receive tax credits to offset the cost of insurance to the individual purchaser . 26 U. S. C. § 36B ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) ; 42 U. S. C. § 18071 ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) . By 2019 , 20 million of the 24 million people who will obtain insurance through an exchange are expected to receive an average federal subsidy of $ 6,460 per person . See CBO , Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation Enacted in March 2010 , pp . 18–19 ( Mar. 30 , 2011 ) . Without the community - rating insurance regulation , however , the average federal subsidy could be much higher ; for community rating greatly lowers the enormous premiums unhealthy individuals would otherwise pay . Federal subsidies would make up much of the difference .	unmatched
The result would be an unintended boon to insurance companies , an unintended harm to the federal fisc , anda corresponding breakdown of the " shared responsibil - ity " between the industry and the federal budget that Congress intended . Thus , the federal subsidies must be invalidated .	unmatched
In the absence of federal subsidies to purchasers , insurance companies will have little incentive to sell insurance on the exchanges . Under the ACA 's scheme , few , if any , individuals would want to buy individual insurance policies outside of an exchange , because federal subsidies would be unavailable outside of an exchange . Difficulty in attracting individuals outside of the exchange would in turn motivate insurers to enter exchanges , despite the exchanges' onerous regulations . See 42 U. S. C. § 18031 . That system of incentives collapses if the federal subsidies are invalidated . Without the federal subsidies , individ - uals would lose the main incentive to purchase insurance inside the exchanges , and some insurers may be unwilling to offer insurance inside of exchanges . With fewer buyers and even fewer sellers , the exchanges would not operate as Congress intended and may not operate at all .	unmatched
There is a second reason why , if community rating is invalidated by the Mandate and Medicaid Expansion 's invalidity , exchanges can not be implemented in a manner consistent with the Act 's design . A key purpose of an exchange is to provide a marketplace of insurance options where prices are standardized regardless of the buy - er 's pre - existing conditions . See ibid . An individual who shops for insurance through an exchange will evaluate different insurance products . The products will offer different benefits and prices . Congress designed the exchanges so the shopper can compare benefits and prices . But the comparison can not be made in the way Congress designed if the prices depend on the shopper 's pre - existing health conditions . The prices would vary from person to person . So without community rating — which prohibits insurers from basing the price of insurance on pre - existing conditions — the exchanges can not operate in the manner Congress intended .	unmatched

Employer - Responsibility Assessment	unmatched
The employer responsibility assessment provides an incentive for employers with at least 50 employees to provide their employees with health insurance options that meet minimum criteria . See 26 U. S. C. § 4980H ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) . Unlike the Individual Mandate , the employer - responsibility assessment does not require employers to provide an insurance option . Instead , it re - quires them to make a payment to the Federal Government if they do not offer insurance to employees and if insurance is bought on an exchange by an employee who qualifies for the exchange 's federal subsidies . See ibid .	unmatched
For two reasons , the employer - responsibility assessment must be invalidated . First , the ACA makes a direct link between the employer - responsibility assessment and the exchanges . The financial assessment against employers occurs only under certain conditions . One of them is the purchase of insurance by an employee on an exchange . With no exchanges , there are no purchases on the exchanges ; and with no purchases on the exchanges , there is nothing to trigger the employer - responsibility assessment .	unmatched
Second , after the invalidation of burdens on individuals ( the Individual Mandate ) , insurers ( the insurance regu - lations and taxes ) , States ( the Medicaid Expansion ) , the Federal Government ( the federal subsidies for exchanges and for the Medicaid Expansion ) , and hospitals ( the reductions in reimbursements ) , the preservation of the employer - responsibility assessment would upset the ACA 's designof " shared responsibility . " It would leave employers as the only parties bearing any significant responsibility . That was not the congressional intent .	unmatched
The Act 's Minor Provisions	unmatched
The next question is whether the invalidation of the ACA 's major provisions requires the Court to invalidate the ACA 's other provisions . It does .	unmatched
The ACA is over 900 pages long . Its regulations include requirements ranging from a break time and secluded place at work for nursing mothers , see 29 U. S. C. § 207(r)(1 ) ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) , to displays of nutritional contentat chain restaurants , see 21 U. S. C. § 343(q)(5)(H).The Act raises billions of dollars in taxes and fees , including exactions imposed on high - income taxpayers , see ACA § § 9015 , 10906 ; HCERA § 1402 , medical devices , see 26 U. S. C. § 4191 ( 2006 ed . , Supp . IV ) , and tanning booths , see § 5000B. It spends government money on , among other things , the study of how to spend less government money . 42 U. S. C. § 1315a . And it includes a number of provisions that provide benefits to the State of a particular legislator . For example , § 10323 , 124Stat . 954 , extends Medicare coverage to individuals exposed to asbestos from a mine in Libby , Montana . Another provision , § 2006 , i d . , at 284 , increases Medicaid payments only in Louisiana .	unmatched
Such provisions validate the Senate Majority Leader 's statement , " ‘ I do n't know if there is a senator that does n't have something in this bill that was important to them . . . . [ And ] if they do n't have something in it important to them , then it does n't speak well of them . That 's what this legislation is all about : It 's the art of compromise.' " Pear , In Health Bill for Everyone , Provisions for a Few , N. Y. Times , Jan. 4 , 2010 , p. A10 ( quoting Sen. Reid ) . Often , a minor provision will be the price paid for support of a major provision . So , if the major provision were unconstitutional , Congress would not have passed the minor one .	unmatched
Without the ACA 's major provisions , many of these minor provisions will not operate in the manner Congress intended . For example , the tax increases are " Revenue Offset Provisions " designed to help offset the cost to the Federal Government of programs like the Medicaid Expansion and the exchanges' federal subsidies . See Title IX , Subtitle A — Revenue Offset Provisions , 124Stat . 847 . With the Medicaid Expansion and the exchanges invalidated , the tax increases no longer operate to offset costs , and they no longer serve the purpose in the Act 's scheme of " shared responsibility " that Congress intended .	unmatched
Some provisions , such as requiring chain restaurants to display nutritional content , appear likely to operate as Congress intended , but they fail the second test for severability . There is no reason to believe that Congress would have enacted them independently . The Court has not previously had occasion to consider severability in the con - text of an omnibus enactment like the ACA , which includes not only many provisions that are ancillary to its central provisions but also many that are entirely unre - lated — hitched on because it was a quick way to get them passed despite opposition , or because their proponents could exact their enactment as the quid pro quo for their needed support . When we are confronted with such a so - called " Christmas tree , " a law to which many nongermane ornaments have been attached , we think the proper rule must be that when the tree no longer exists the ornaments are superfluous . We have no reliable basis for knowing which pieces of the Act would have passed on their own . It is certain that many of them would not have , and it is not a proper function of this Court to guess which . To sever the statute in that manner " ‘ would be to make a new law , not to enforce an old one . This is not part of our duty.' " Trade - Mark Cases , 100 U. S. , at 99 .	unmatched
This Court must not impose risks unintended by Congress or produce legislation Congress may have lacked the support to enact . For those reasons , the unconstitutionality of both the Individual Mandate and the Medicaid Expansion requires the invalidation of the Affordable Care Act 's other provisions .	unmatched
The Court today decides to save a statute Congress did not write . It rules that what the statute declares to be a requirement with a penalty is instead an option subjectto a tax . And it changes the intentionally coercive sanction of a total cut - off of Medicaid funds to a supposedly noncoercive cut - off of only the incremental funds that the Act makes available .	unmatched
The Court regards its strained statutory interpretation as judicial modesty . It is not . It amounts instead to a vast judicial overreaching . It creates a debilitated , inoperable version of health - care regulation that Congress did not enact and the public does not expect . It makes enactment of sensible health - care regulation more difficult , since Congress can not start afresh but must take as its point of departure a jumble of now senseless provisions , provisions that certain interests favored under the Court 's new design will struggle to retain . And it leaves the public and the States to expend vast sums of money on requirements that may or may not survive the necessary congressional revision .	unmatched
The Court 's disposition , invented and atextual as it is , does not even have the merit of avoiding constitutional difficulties . It creates them . The holding that the Individual Mandate is a tax raises a difficult constitutional question ( what is a direct tax ? ) that the Court resolves with inadequate deliberation . And the judgment on the Medicaid Expansion issue ushers in new federalism concerns and places an unaccustomed strain upon the Union . Those States that decline the Medicaid Expansion must subsidize , by the federal tax dollars taken from their citizens , vast grants to the States that accept the Medicaid Expansion . If that destabilizing political dynamic , so antagonistic to a harmonious Union , is to be introduced at all , it should be by Congress , not by the Judiciary .	articlei#section9
The values that should have determined our course today are caution , minimalism , and the understanding that the Federal Government is one of limited powers . Butthe Court 's ruling undermines those values at every turn . In the name of restraint , it overreaches . In the name of constitutional avoidance , it creates new constitutional questions . In the name of cooperative federalism , it undermines state sovereignty .	unmatched
The Constitution , though it dates from the founding of the Republic , has powerful meaning and vital relevanceto our own times . The constitutional protections that this case involves are protections of structure . Structural protections — notably , the restraints imposed by federalism and separation of powers — are less romantic and have less obvious a connection to personal freedom than the provisions of the Bill of Rights or the Civil War Amendments . Hence they tend to be undervalued or even forgotten by our citizens . It should be the responsibility of the Court to teach otherwise , to remind our people that the Framers considered structural protections of freedom the most im - portant ones , for which reason they alone were embod - ied in the original Constitution and not left to later amendment . The fragmentation of power produced by the structure of our Government is central to liberty , and when we destroy it , we place liberty at peril . Today 's decision should have vindicated , should have taught , this truth ; instead , our judgment today has disregarded it .	unmatched
For the reasons here stated , we would find the Act invalid in its entirety . We respectfully dissent .	unmatched
I dissent for the reasons stated in our joint opinion , butI write separately to say a word about the Commerce Clause . The joint dissent and The Chief Justice cor - rectly apply our precedents to conclude that the Individual Mandate is beyond the power granted to Congress un - der the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause . Under those precedents , Congress may regulate " economic activity [ that ] substantially affects interstate commerce . " United States v. Lopez , 514 U. S. 549 , 560 ( 1995 ) . I adhere to my view that " the very notion of a ‘ substantial effects' test under the Commerce Clause is inconsistent with the original understanding of Congress' powers and with this Court 's early Commerce Clause cases . " United States v. Morrison , 529 U. S. 598 , 627 ( 2000 ) ( Thomas , J. , concurring ) ; see also Lopez , supra , at 584–602 ( Thomas , J. , concurring ) ; Gonzales v. Raich , 545 U. S. 1–69 ( 2005 ) ( Thomas , J. , dissenting ) . As I have explained , the Court 's continued use of that test " has encouraged the Federal Government to persist in its view that the Commerce Clause has virtually no limits . " Morrison , supra , at 627 . The Government 's unprecedented claim in this suit that it may regulate not only economic activity but also inactivity that substantially affects interstate commerce is a case in point .	articlei#section8
During the 1984 Republican National Convention , respondent Johnson participated in a political demonstration to protest the policies of the Reagan administration and some Dallas - based corporations . After a march through the city streets , Johnson burned an American flag while protesters chanted . No one was physically injured or threatened with injury , although several witnesses were seriously offended by the flag burning . Johnson was convicted of desecration of a venerated object in violation of a Texas statute , and a state court of appeals affirmed . However , the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed , holding that the State , consistent with the First Amendment , could not punish Johnson for burning the flag in these circumstances . The court first found that Johnson 's burning of the flag was expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment . The court concluded that the State could not criminally sanction flag desecration in order to preserve the flag as a symbol of national unity . It also held that the statute did not meet the State 's goal of preventing breaches of the peace , since it was not drawn narrowly enough to encompass only those flag burnings that would likely result in a serious disturbance , and since the flag burning in this case did not threaten such a reaction . Further , it stressed that another Texas statute prohibited breaches of the peace and could be used to prevent disturbances without punishing this flag desecration .	first_amendment
Held : Johnson 's conviction for flag desecration is inconsistent with the First Amendment . Pp . 402 - 420 .	first_amendment
( a ) Under the circumstances , Johnson 's burning of the flag constituted expressive conduct , permitting him to invoke the First Amendment . The State conceded that the conduct was expressive . Occurring as it did at the end of a demonstration coinciding with the Republican National Convention , the expressive , overtly political nature of the conduct was both intentional and overwhelmingly apparent . Pp . 402 - 406 .	first_amendment
( b ) Texas has not asserted an interest in support of Johnson 's conviction that is unrelated to the suppression of expression and would therefore permit application of the test set forth in United States v. O'Brien , 391 U.S. 367 , whereby an important governmental interest in regulating nonspeech can justify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms when speech and nonspeech elements are combined in the same course of conduct . An interest in preventing breaches of the peace is not implicated on this record . Expression may not be prohibited [ p398 ] on the basis that an audience that takes serious offense to the expression may disturb the peace , since the Government can not assume that every expression of a provocative idea will incite a riot , but must look to the actual circumstances surrounding the expression . Johnson 's expression of dissatisfaction with the Federal Government 's policies also does not fall within the class of " fighting words " likely to be seen as a direct personal insult or an invitation to exchange fisticuffs . This Court 's holding does not forbid a State to prevent " imminent lawless action " and , in fact , Texas has a law specifically prohibiting breaches of the peace . Texas ' interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity is related to expression in this case and , thus , falls outside the O'Brien test . Pp . 406 - 410 .	first_amendment
( c ) The latter interest does not justify Johnson 's conviction . The restriction on Johnson 's political expression is content based , since the Texas statute is not aimed at protecting the physical integrity of the flag in all circumstances , but is designed to protect it from intentional and knowing abuse that causes serious offense to others . It is therefore subject to " the most exacting scrutiny . " Boos v. Barry , 485 U.S. 312 . The Government may not prohibit the verbal or nonverbal expression of an idea merely because society finds the idea offensive or disagreeable , even where our flag is involved . Nor may a State foster its own view of the flag by prohibiting expressive conduct relating to it , since the Government may not permit designated symbols to be used to communicate a limited set of messages . Moreover , this Court will not create an exception to these principles protected by the First Amendment for the American flag alone . Pp . 410 - 422 .	first_amendment

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court .	unmatched
After publicly burning an American flag as a means of political protest , Gregory Lee Johnson was convicted of desecrating a flag in violation of Texas law . This case presents the question whether his conviction is consistent with the First Amendment . We hold that it is not .	first_amendment
While the Republican National Convention was taking place in Dallas in 1984 , respondent Johnson participated in a political demonstration dubbed the " Republican War Chest Tour . " As explained in literature distributed by the demonstrators and in speeches made by them , the purpose of this event was to protest the policies of the Reagan administration and of certain Dallas - based corporations . The demonstrators marched through the Dallas streets , chanting political slogans and stopping at several corporate locations to stage " die - ins " intended to dramatize the consequences of nuclear war . On several occasions they spray - painted the walls of buildings and overturned potted plants , but Johnson himself took no part in such activities . He did , however , accept an American flag handed to him by a fellow protestor who had taken it from a flagpole outside one of the targeted buildings .	unmatched
The demonstration ended in front of Dallas City Hall , where Johnson unfurled the American flag , doused it with kerosene , and set it on fire . While the flag burned , the protestors chanted , " America , the red , white , and blue , we spit on you . " After the demonstrators dispersed , a witness to the flag burning collected the flag 's remains and buried them in his backyard . No one was physically injured or threatened with injury , though several witnesses testified that they had been seriously offended by the flag burning . [ p400 ]	unmatched
Of the approximately 100 demonstrators , Johnson alone was charged with a crime . The only criminal offense with which he was charged was the desecration of a venerated object in violation of Tex . Penal Code Ann . § 42.09(a)(3 ) ( 1989 ) . [ n1 ] After a trial , he was convicted , sentenced to one year in prison , and fined $ 2,000 . The Court of Appeals for the Fifth District of Texas at Dallas affirmed Johnson 's conviction , 706 S.W.2d 120 ( 1986 ) , but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed , 755 S.W.2d 92 ( 1988 ) , holding that the State could not , consistent with the First Amendment , punish Johnson for burning the flag in these circumstances .	first_amendment
The Court of Criminal Appeals began by recognizing that Johnson 's conduct was symbolic speech protected by the First Amendment :	first_amendment
Id. at 95 . To justify Johnson 's conviction for engaging in symbolic speech , the State asserted two interests : preserving the flag as a symbol of national unity and preventing breaches of the peace . The Court of Criminal Appeals held that neither interest supported his conviction . [ p401 ]	unmatched
Acknowledging that this Court had not yet decided whether the Government may criminally sanction flag desecration in order to preserve the flag 's symbolic value , the Texas court nevertheless concluded that our decision in West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette , 319 U.S. 624 ( 1943 ) , suggested that furthering this interest by curtailing speech was impermissible . " Recognizing that the right to differ is the centerpiece of our First Amendment freedoms , " the court explained ,	first_amendment
755 S.W.2d at 97 . Noting that the State had not shown that the flag was in " grave and immediate danger , " Barnette , supra , at 639 , of being stripped of its symbolic value , the Texas court also decided that the flag 's special status was not endangered by Johnson 's conduct . 755 S.W.2d at 97 .	unmatched
As to the State 's goal of preventing breaches of the peace , the court concluded that the flag desecration statute was not drawn narrowly enough to encompass only those flag burnings that were likely to result in a serious disturbance of the peace . And in fact , the court emphasized , the flag burning in this particular case did not threaten such a reaction . " ‘ Serious offense ' occurred , " the court admitted ,	unmatched
Id. at 96 . The court also stressed that another Texas statute , Tex . Penal Code Ann . § 42.01 ( 1989 ) , prohibited breaches of the peace . Citing Boos v. Barry , 485 U.S. 312 ( 1988 ) , the court decided that § 42.01 demonstrated Texas ' ability to prevent disturbances of the peace without punishing this flag desecration . 755 S.W.2d at 96 . [ p402 ]	unmatched
Because it reversed Johnson 's conviction on the ground that § 42.09 was unconstitutional as applied to him , the state court did not address Johnson 's argument that the statute was , on its face , unconstitutionally vague and overbroad . We granted certiorari , 488 U.S. 907 ( 1988 ) , and now affirm .	unmatched
Johnson was convicted of flag desecration for burning the flag , rather than for uttering insulting words . [ n2 ] This fact [ p403 ] somewhat complicates our consideration of his conviction under the First Amendment . We must first determine whether Johnson 's burning of the flag constituted expressive conduct , permitting him to invoke the First Amendment in challenging his conviction . See , e.g. , Spence v. Washington , 418 U.S. 405 , 409 - 411 ( 1974 ) . If his conduct was expressive , we next decide whether the State 's regulation is related to the suppression of free expression . See , e.g. , United States v. O'Brien , 391 U.S. 367 , 377 ( 1968 ) ; Spence , supra , at 414 , n. 8 . If the State 's regulation is not related to expression , then the less stringent standard we announced in United States v. O'Brien for regulations of noncommunicative conduct controls . See O'Brien , supra , at 377 . If it is , then we are outside of O'Brien 's test , and we must ask whether this interest justifies Johnson 's conviction under a more demanding standard . [ n3 ] See Spence , supra , at 411 . A [ p404 ] third possibility is that the State 's asserted interest is simply not implicated on these facts , and , in that event , the interest drops out of the picture . See 418 U.S. at 414 , n. 8 .	first_amendment
The First Amendment literally forbids the abridgment only of " speech , " but we have long recognized that its protection does not end at the spoken or written word . While we have rejected	first_amendment
United States v. O'Brien , supra , at 376 , we have acknowledged that conduct may be " sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of the First and Fourteenth Amendments , " Spence , supra , at 409 .	amendmentxiv,first_amendment
In deciding whether particular conduct possesses sufficient communicative elements to bring the First Amendment into play , we have asked whether	first_amendment
418 U.S. at 410 - 411 . Hence , we have recognized the expressive nature of students ' wearing of black armbands to protest American military involvement in Vietnam , Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist . , 393 U.S. 503 , 505 ( 1969 ) ; of a sit - in by blacks in a " whites only " area to protest segregation , Brown v. Louisiana , 383 U.S. 131 , 141 - 142 ( 1966 ) ; of the wearing of American military uniforms in a dramatic presentation criticizing American involvement in Vietnam , Schacht v. United States , 398 U.S. 58 ( 1970 ) ; and of picketing about a wide variety of causes , see , e.g. , Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza , Inc. , 391 U.S. 308 , 313 - 314 ( 1968 ) ; United States v. Grace , 461 U.S. 171 , 176 ( 1983 ) .	unmatched
Especially pertinent to this case are our decisions recognizing the communicative nature of conduct relating to flags . Attaching a peace sign to the flag , Spence , supra , at 418 U.S. 409"]409 - 410 ; refusing to salute the flag , Barnette , 319 U.S. at 632 ; and displaying a red flag , 409 - 410 ; refusing to salute the flag , Barnette , 319 U.S. at 632 ; and displaying a red flag , Stromberg v. California , 283 U.S. 359 , [ p405 ] 368 - 369 ( 1931 ) , we have held , all may find shelter under the First Amendment . See also Smith v. Goguen , 415 U.S. 566 , 588 ( 1974 ) ( WHITE , J. , concurring in judgment ) ( treating flag " contemptuously " by wearing pants with small flag sewn into their seat is expressive conduct ) . That we have had little difficulty identifying an expressive element in conduct relating to flags should not be surprising . The very purpose of a national flag is to serve as a symbol of our country ; it is , one might say , " the one visible manifestation of two hundred years of nationhood . " Id. at 603 ( REHNQUIST , J. , dissenting ) . Thus , we have observed :	first_amendment
Barnette , supra , at 632 . Pregnant with expressive content , the flag as readily signifies this Nation as does the combination of letters found in " America . "	unmatched
We have not automatically concluded , however , that any action taken with respect to our flag is expressive . Instead , in characterizing such action for First Amendment purposes , we have considered the context in which it occurred . In Spence , for example , we emphasized that Spence 's taping of a peace sign to his flag was " roughly simultaneous with and concededly triggered by the Cambodian incursion and the Kent State tragedy . " 418 U.S. at 410 . The State of Washington had conceded , in fact , that Spence 's conduct was a form of communication , and we stated that " the State 's concession is inevitable on this record . " Id. at 409 .	first_amendment
The State of Texas conceded for purposes of its oral argument in this case that Johnson 's conduct was expressive conduct , Tr . of Oral Arg . 4 , and this concession seems to us as [ p406 ] prudent as was Washington 's in Spence . Johnson burned an American flag as part -- indeed , as the culmination -- of a political demonstration that coincided with the convening of the Republican Party and its renomination of Ronald Reagan for President . The expressive , overtly political nature of this conduct was both intentional and overwhelmingly apparent . At his trial , Johnson explained his reasons for burning the flag as follows :	unmatched
5 Record 656 . In these circumstances , Johnson 's burning of the flag was conduct " sufficiently imbued with elements of communication , " Spence , 418 U.S. at 409 , to implicate the First Amendment .	first_amendment
The government generally has a freer hand in restricting expressive conduct than it has in restricting the written or spoken word . See O'Brien , 391 U.S. at 376 - 377 ; Clark v. Community for Creative Non - Violence , 468 U.S. 288 , 293 ( 1984 ) ; Dallas v. Stanglin , 490 U.S. 19 , 25 ( 1989 ) . It may not , however , proscribe particular conduct because it has expressive elements .	unmatched
Community for Creative Non - Violence v. Watt , 227 U.S.App . D.C. 19 , 55 - 56 , 703 F.2d 586 , 622 - 623 ( 1983 ) ( Scalia , J. , dissenting ) ( emphasis in original ) , rev'd sub nom . Clark v. Community for Creative Non - Violence , supra . It is , in short , not simply the verbal or nonverbal nature of the expression , but the governmental [ p407 ] interest at stake , that helps to determine whether a restriction on that expression is valid .	unmatched
Thus , although we have recognized that , where	unmatched
O'Brien , supra , at 376 , we have limited the applicability of O'Brien 's relatively lenient standard to those cases in which " the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression . " Id. at 377 ; see also Spence , 418 U.S. at 414 , n. 8 . In stating , moreover , that O'Brien 's test " in the last analysis is little , if any , different from the standard applied to time , place , or manner restrictions , " Clark , supra , at 298 , we have highlighted the requirement that the governmental interest in question be unconnected to expression in order to come under O'Brien 's less demanding rule .	unmatched
In order to decide whether O'Brien 's test applies here , therefore , we must decide whether Texas has asserted an interest in support of Johnson 's conviction that is unrelated to the suppression of expression . If we find that an interest asserted by the State is simply not implicated on the facts before us , we need not ask whether O'Brien 's test applies . See Spence , supra , at 414 , n. 8 . The State offers two separate interests to justify this conviction : preventing breaches of the peace and preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity . We hold that the first interest is not implicated on this record , and that the second is related to the suppression of expression .	unmatched
Texas claims that its interest in preventing breaches of the peace justifies Johnson 's conviction for flag desecration . [ n4 ] [ p408 ] However , no disturbance of the peace actually occurred or threatened to occur because of Johnson 's burning of the flag . Although the State stresses the disruptive behavior of the protestors during their march toward City Hall , Brief for Petitioner 34 - 36 , it admits that " no actual breach of the peace occurred at the time of the flagburning or in response to the flagburning . " Id. at 34 . The State 's emphasis on the protestors ' disorderly actions prior to arriving at City Hall is not only somewhat surprising , given that no charges were brought on the basis of this conduct , but it also fails to show that a disturbance of the peace was a likely reaction to Johnson 's conduct . The only evidence offered by the State at trial to show the reaction to Johnson 's actions was the testimony of several persons who had been seriously offended by the flag burning . Id. at 6 - 7 .	unmatched
The State 's position , therefore , amounts to a claim that an audience that takes serious offense at particular expression is necessarily likely to disturb the peace , and that the expression may be prohibited on this basis . [ n5 ] Our precedents do not countenance such a presumption . On the contrary , they recognize that a principal	unmatched
Terminiello v. Chicago , 337 U.S. 1 , 4 ( 1949 ) . See also Cox v. Louisiana , 379 U.S. 536 , 551 ( 1965 ) ; Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist . , 393 U.S. at 508 - 509 ; Coates v. Cincinnati , 402 U.S. 611 , 615 ( 1971 ) ; Hustler Magazine , Inc. v. Falwell , 485 U.S. 46 , 55 - 56 ( 1988 ) . It would be odd indeed to conclude both that " if it is the speaker 's opinion that gives offense , that consequence is a reason for according it constitutional protection , " FCC v. Pacifica Foundation , 438 U.S. 726 , 745 ( 1978 ) ( opinion of STEVENS , J. ) , and that the Government may ban the expression of certain disagreeable ideas on the unsupported presumption that their very disagreeableness will provoke violence .	unmatched
Thus , we have not permitted the government to assume that every expression of a provocative idea will incite a riot , but have instead required careful consideration of the actual circumstances surrounding such expression , asking whether the expression " is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action . " Brandenburg v. Ohio , 395 U.S. 444 , 447 ( 1969 ) ( reviewing circumstances surrounding rally and speeches by Ku Klux Klan ) . To accept Texas ' arguments that it need only demonstrate " the potential for a breach of the peace , " Brief for Petitioner 37 , and that every flag burning necessarily possesses that potential , would be to eviscerate our holding in Brandenburg . This we decline to do .	unmatched
Nor does Johnson 's expressive conduct fall within that small class of " fighting words " that are " likely to provoke the average person to retaliation , and thereby cause a breach of the peace . " Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire , 315 U.S. 568 , 574 ( 1942 ) . No reasonable onlooker would have regarded Johnson 's generalized expression of dissatisfaction with the policies of the Federal Government as a direct personal insult or an invitation to exchange fisticuffs . See i d . at 572 - 573 ; Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310 U.S. 296 , 309 ( 1940 ) ; FCC v. Pacifica Foundation , supra , at 745 ( opinion of STEVENS , J. ) . [ p410 ]	unmatched
We thus conclude that the State 's interest in maintaining order is not implicated on these facts . The State need not worry that our holding will disable it from preserving the peace . We do not suggest that the First Amendment forbids a State to prevent " imminent lawless action . " Brandenburg , supra , at 447 . And , in fact , Texas already has a statute specifically prohibiting breaches of the peace , Tex . Penal Code Ann . § 42.01 ( 1989 ) , which tends to confirm that Texas need not punish this flag desecration in order to keep the peace . See Boos v. Barry , 485 U.S. at 327 - 329 .	first_amendment
The State also asserts an interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity . In Spence , we acknowledged that the government 's interest in preserving the flag 's special symbolic value " is directly related to expression in the context of activity " such as affixing a peace symbol to a flag . 418 U.S. at 414 , n. 8 . We are equally persuaded that this interest is related to expression in the case of Johnson 's burning of the flag . The State , apparently , is concerned that such conduct will lead people to believe either that the flag does not stand for nationhood and national unity , but instead reflects other , less positive concepts , or that the concepts reflected in the flag do not in fact exist , that is , that we do not enjoy unity as a Nation . These concerns blossom only when a person 's treatment of the flag communicates some message , and thus are related " to the suppression of free expression " within the meaning of O'Brien . We are thus outside of O'Brien 's test altogether .	unmatched
It remains to consider whether the State 's interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity justifies Johnson 's conviction .	unmatched
As in Spence , " [ w]e are confronted with a case of prosecution for the expression of an idea through activity , " and " [ a]ccordingly , we must examine with particular care the interests [ p411 ] advanced by [ petitioner ] to support its prosecution . " 418 U.S. at 418 U.S. 411"]411 . Johnson was not , we add , prosecuted for the expression of just any idea ; he was prosecuted for his expression of dissatisfaction with the policies of this country , expression situated at the core of our First Amendment values . See , e.g. , Boos v. Barry , supra , at 318 ; 411 . Johnson was not , we add , prosecuted for the expression of just any idea ; he was prosecuted for his expression of dissatisfaction with the policies of this country , expression situated at the core of our First Amendment values . See , e.g. , Boos v. Barry , supra , at 318 ; Frisby v. Schultz , 487 U.S. 474 , 479 ( 1988 ) .	first_amendment
Moreover , Johnson was prosecuted because he knew that his politically charged expression would cause " serious offense . " If he had burned the flag as a means of disposing of it because it was dirty or torn , he would not have been convicted of flag desecration under this Texas law : federal law designates burning as the preferred means of disposing of a flag " when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display , " 36 U.S.C. § 176(k ) , and Texas has no quarrel with this means of disposal . Brief for Petitioner 45 . The Texas law is thus not aimed at protecting the physical integrity of the flag in all circumstances , but is designed instead to protect it only against impairments that would cause serious offense to others . [ n6 ] Texas concedes as much :	unmatched
Id. at 44 .	unmatched
Whether Johnson 's treatment of the flag violated Texas law thus depended on the likely communicative impact of his expressive conduct . [ n7 ] Our decision in Boos v. Barry , supra , [ p412 ] tells us that this restriction on Johnson 's expression is content - based . In Boos , we considered the constitutionality of a law prohibiting	unmatched
Id. at 315 . Rejecting the argument that the law was content - neutral because it was justified by " our international law obligation to shield diplomats from speech that offends their dignity , " i d . at 320 , we held that " [ t]he emotive impact of speech on its audience is not a ‘ secondary effect ' " unrelated to the content of the expression itself . Id. at 321 ( plurality opinion ) ; see also i d . at 334 ( BRENNAN , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) .	unmatched
According to the principles announced in Boos , Johnson 's political expression was restricted because of the content of the message he conveyed . We must therefore subject the State 's asserted interest in preserving the special symbolic character of the flag to " the most exacting scrutiny . " Boos v. Barry , 485 U.S. at 321 .

Texas argues that its interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity survives this close analysis . Quoting extensively from the writings of this Court chronicling the flag 's historic and symbolic role in our society , the State emphasizes the " ‘ special place " ' reserved for the flag in our Nation . Brief for Petitioner 22 , quoting Smith v. Goguen , 415 U.S. at 601 ( REHNQUIST , J. , dissenting ) . The State 's argument is not that it has an interest simply in maintaining the flag as a symbol of something , no matter what it symbolizes ; indeed , if that were the State 's position , it would be difficult to see how that interest is endangered by highly symbolic conduct such as Johnson 's . Rather , the State 's claim is that it has an interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity , a symbol with a determinate range of meanings . Brief for Petitioner 20 - 24 . According to Texas , if one physically treats the flag in a way that would tend to cast doubt on either the idea that nationhood and national unity are the flag 's referents or that national unity actually exists , the message conveyed thereby is a harmful one , and therefore may be prohibited .

If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment , it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable . See , e.g. , Hustler Magazine v. Falwell , 485 U.S. at 55 - 56 ; City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent , 466 U.S. 789 , 804 ( 1984 ) ; Bolger v.

We have not recognized an exception to this principle even where our flag has been involved . In Street v. New York , 394 U.S. 576 ( 1969 ) , we held that a State may not criminally punish a person for uttering words critical of the flag .

See also Goguen , 415 U.S. at 588 ( WHITE , J. , concurring in judgment ) ( to convict person who had sewn a flag onto the seat of his pants for " contemptuous " treatment of the flag would be " [ t]o convict not to protect the physical integrity or to protect against acts interfering with the proper use of the flag , but to punish for communicating ideas unacceptable to the controlling majority in the legislature " ) .	unmatched
In short , nothing in our precedents suggests that a State may foster its own view of the flag by prohibiting expressive conduct relating to it . [ n10 ] To bring its argument outside our [ p416 ] precedents , Texas attempts to convince us that , even if its interest in preserving the flag 's symbolic role does not allow it to prohibit words or some expressive conduct critical of the flag , it does permit it to forbid the outright destruction of the flag . The State 's argument can not depend here on the distinction between written or spoken words and nonverbal conduct . That distinction , we have shown , is of no moment where the nonverbal conduct is expressive , as it is here , and where the regulation of that conduct is related to expression , as it is here . See supra at 402 - 403 . In addition , both Barnette and Spence involved expressive conduct , not only verbal communication , and both found that conduct protected .	unmatched
Texas ' focus on the precise nature of Johnson 's expression , moreover , misses the point of our prior decisions : their enduring lesson , that the government may not prohibit expression simply because it disagrees with its message , is not dependent on the particular mode in which one chooses to express an idea . [ n11 ] If we were to hold that a State may forbid flag burning wherever it is likely to endanger the flag 's symbolic role , but allow it wherever burning a flag promotes that role -- as where , for example , a person ceremoniously burns a dirty flag -- we would be saying that when it comes to impairing the flag 's physical integrity , the flag itself may be used as [ p417 ] a symbol -- as a substitute for the written or spoken word or a " short cut from mind to mind " -- only in one direction . We would be permitting a State to " prescribe what shall be orthodox " by saying that one may burn the flag to convey one 's attitude toward it and its referents only if one does not endanger the flag 's representation of nationhood and national unity .	unmatched
We never before have held that the Government may ensure that a symbol be used to express only one view of that symbol or its referents . Indeed , in Schacht v. United States , we invalidated a federal statute permitting an actor portraying a member of one of our armed forces to " ‘ wear the uniform of that armed force if the portrayal does not tend to discredit that armed force . ' " 398 U.S. at 60 , quoting 10 U.S.C. § 772(f ) . This proviso , we held ,	unmatched
Id. at 63 .	unmatched
We perceive no basis on which to hold that the principle underlying our decision in Schacht does not apply to this case . To conclude that the government may permit designated symbols to be used to communicate only a limited set of messages would be to enter territory having no discernible or defensible boundaries . Could the government , on this theory , prohibit the burning of state flags ? Of copies of the Presidential seal ? Of the Constitution ? In evaluating these choices under the First Amendment , how would we decide which symbols were sufficiently special to warrant this unique status ? To do so , we would be forced to consult our own political preferences , and impose them on the citizenry , in the very way that the First Amendment forbids us to do . See Carey v. Brown , 447 U.S. at 466 - 467 .	first_amendment
There is , moreover , no indication -- either in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it -- that a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone . Indeed , we would not be surprised to learn that the persons [ p418 ] who framed our Constitution and wrote the Amendment that we now construe were not known for their reverence for the Union Jack . The First Amendment does not guarantee that other concepts virtually sacred to our Nation as a whole -- such as the principle that discrimination on the basis of race is odious and destructive -- will go unquestioned in the marketplace of ideas . See Brandenburg v. Ohio , 395 U.S. 444 ( 1969 ) . We decline , therefore , to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment .	first_amendment
It is not the State 's ends , but its means , to which we object . It can not be gainsaid that there is a special place reserved for the flag in this Nation , and thus we do not doubt that the government has a legitimate interest in making efforts to " preserv[e ] the national flag as an unalloyed symbol of our country . " Spence , 418 U.S. at 412 . We reject the suggestion , urged at oral argument by counsel for Johnson , that the government lacks " any state interest whatsoever " in regulating the manner in which the flag may be displayed . Tr . of Oral Arg . 38 . Congress has , for example , enacted precatory regulations describing the proper treatment of the flag , see 36 U.S.C. § § 173 - 177 , and we cast no doubt on the legitimacy of its interest in making such recommendations . To say that the government has an interest in encouraging proper treatment of the flag , however , is not to say that it may criminally punish a person for burning a flag as a means of political protest .	unmatched

We are fortified in today 's conclusion by our conviction that forbidding criminal punishment for conduct such as Johnson 's will not endanger the special role played by our flag or the feelings it inspires . To paraphrase Justice Holmes , we submit that nobody can suppose that this one gesture of an unknown [ p419 ] man will change our Nation 's attitude towards its flag . See Abrams v. United States , 250 U.S. 616 , 628 ( 1919 ) ( Holmes , J. , dissenting ) . Indeed , Texas ' argument that the burning of an American flag " ‘ is an act having a high likelihood to cause a breach of the peace , ' " Brief for Petitioner 31 , quoting Sutherland v. DeWulf , 323 F.Supp . 740 , 745 ( SD Ill.1971 ) ( citation omitted ) , and its statute 's implicit assumption that physical mistreatment of the flag will lead to " serious offense , " tend to confirm that the flag 's special role is not in danger ; if it were , no one would riot or take offense because a flag had been burned .	unmatched
We are tempted to say , in fact , that the flag 's deservedly cherished place in our community will be strengthened , not weakened , by our holding today . Our decision is a reaffirmation of the principles of freedom and inclusiveness that the flag best reflects , and of the conviction that our toleration of criticism such as Johnson 's is a sign and source of our strength . Indeed , one of the proudest images of our flag , the one immortalized in our own national anthem , is of the bombardment it survived at Fort McHenry . It is the Nation 's resilience , not its rigidity , that Texas sees reflected in the flag -- and it is that resilience that we reassert today .	unmatched
The way to preserve the flag 's special role is not to punish those who feel differently about these matters . It is to persuade them that they are wrong .	unmatched
Whitney v. California , 274 U.S. 357 , 377 ( 1927 ) ( Brandeis , J. , concurring ) . And , precisely because it is our flag that is involved , one 's response to the flag - burner [ p420 ] may exploit the uniquely persuasive power of the flag itself . We can imagine no more appropriate response to burning a flag than waving one 's own , no better way to counter a flag burner 's message than by saluting the flag that burns , no surer means of preserving the dignity even of the flag that burned than by -- as one witness here did -- according its remains a respectful burial . We do not consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration , for in doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem represents .	unmatched
Johnson was convicted for engaging in expressive conduct . The State 's interest in preventing breaches of the peace does not support his conviction , because Johnson 's conduct did not threaten to disturb the peace . Nor does the State 's interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity justify his criminal conviction for engaging in political expression . The judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is therefore	unmatched

Tex . Penal Code Ann . § 42.09 ( 1989 ) provides in full :	unmatched
Because the prosecutor 's closing argument observed that Johnson had led the protestors in chants denouncing the flag while it burned , Johnson suggests that he may have been convicted for uttering critical words , rather than for burning the flag . Brief for Respondent 33 - 34 . He relies on Street v. New York , 394 U.S. 576 , 578 ( 1969 ) , in which we reversed a conviction obtained under a New York statute that prohibited publicly defying or casting contempt on the flag " either by words or act " because we were persuaded that the defendant may have been convicted for his words alone . Unlike the law we faced in Street , however , the Texas flag desecration statute does not on its face permit conviction for remarks critical of the flag , as Johnson himself admits . See Brief for Respondent 34 . Nor was the jury in this case told that it could convict Johnson of flag desecration if it found only that he had uttered words critical of the flag and its referents .	unmatched
Johnson emphasizes , though , that the jury was instructed -- according to Texas ' law of parties -- that	unmatched
Brief for Respondent 2 , n. 2 , quoting 1 Record 49 . The State offered this instruction because Johnson 's defense was that he was not the person who had burned the flag . Johnson did not object to this instruction at trial , and although he challenged it on direct appeal , he did so only on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support it . 706 S.W.2d 120 , 124 ( Tex . App.1986 ) . It is only in this Court that Johnson has argued that the law - of - parties instruction might have led the jury to convict him for his words alone . Even if we were to find that this argument is properly raised here , however , we would conclude that it has no merit in these circumstances . The instruction would not have permitted a conviction merely for the pejorative nature of Johnson 's words , and those words themselves did not encourage the burning of the flag , as the instruction seems to require . Given the additional fact that " the bulk of the State 's argument was premised on Johnson 's culpability as a sole actor , " ibid . , we find it too unlikely that the jury convicted Johnson on the basis of this alternative theory to consider reversing his conviction on this ground .	unmatched
Although Johnson has raised a facial challenge to Texas ' flag desecration statute , we choose to resolve this case on the basis of his claim that the statute , as applied to him , violates the First Amendment . Section 42.09 regulates only physical conduct with respect to the flag , not the written or spoken word , and although one violates the statute only if one " knows " that one 's physical treatment of the flag " will seriously offend one or more persons likely to observe or discover his action , " Tex . Penal Code Ann . § 42.09(b ) ( 1989 ) , this fact does not necessarily mean that the statute applies only to expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment . Cf . Smith v. Goguen , 415 U.S. 566 , 588 ( 1974 ) ( WHITE , J. , concurring in judgment ) ( statute prohibiting " contemptuous " treatment of flag encompasses only expressive conduct ) . A tired person might , for example , drag a flag through the mud , knowing that this conduct is likely to offend others , and yet have no thought of expressing any idea ; neither the language nor the Texas courts ' interpretations of the statute precludes the possibility that such a person would be prosecuted for flag desecration . Because the prosecution of a person who had not engaged in expressive conduct would pose a different case , and because this case may be disposed of on narrower grounds , we address only Johnson 's claim that § 42.09 , as applied to political expression like his , violates the First Amendment .	first_amendment
Relying on our decision in Boos v. Barry , 485 U.S. 312 " ] 485 U.S. 312 ( 1988 ) , Johnson argues that this state interest is related to the suppression of free expression within the meaning of 485 U.S. 312 ( 1988 ) , Johnson argues that this state interest is related to the suppression of free expression within the meaning of United States v. O'Brien , 391 U.S. 367 ( 1968 ) . He reasons that the violent reaction to flag burnings feared by Texas would be the result of the message conveyed by them , and that this fact connects the State 's interest to the suppression of expression . Brief for Respondent 12 , n. 11 . This view has found some favor in the lower courts . See Monroe v. State Court of Fulton County , 739 F.2d 568 574 - 575 ( CA11 1984 ) . Johnson 's theory may overread Boos insofar as it suggests that a desire to prevent a violent audience reaction is " related to expression " in the same way that a desire to prevent an audience from being offended is " related to expression . " Because we find that the State 's interest in preventing breaches of the peace is not implicated on these facts , however , we need not venture further into this area .	unmatched
There is , of course , a tension between this argument and the State 's claim that one need not actually cause serious offense in order to violate § 42.09 . See Brief for Petitioner 44 .	unmatched
Cf . Smith v. Goguen , 415 U.S. at 590 - 591 ( BLACKMUN , J. , dissenting ) ( emphasizing that lower court appeared to have construed state statute so as to protect physical integrity of the flag in all circumstances ) ; i d . at 597 - 598 ( REHNQUIST , J. , dissenting ) ( same ) .	unmatched
Texas suggests that Johnson 's conviction did not depend on the onlookers ' reaction to the flag burning , because § 42.09 is violated only when a person physically mistreats the flag in a way that he " knows will seriously offend one or more persons likely to observe or discover his action . " Tex . Penal Code Ann . § 42.09(b ) ( 1969 ) ( emphasis added ) . " The ‘ serious offense ' language of the statute , " Texas argues , " refers to an individual 's intent and to the manner in which the conduct is effectuated , not to the reaction of the crowd . " Brief for Petitioner 44 . If the statute were aimed only at the actor 's intent , and not at the communicative impact of his actions , however , there would be little reason for the law to be triggered only when an audience is " likely " to be present . At Johnson 's trial , indeed , the State itself seems not to have seen the distinction between knowledge and actual communicative impact that it now stresses : it proved the element of knowledge by offering the testimony of persons who had in fact been seriously offended by Johnson 's conduct . Id. at 6 - 7 . In any event , we find the distinction between Texas ' statute and one dependent on actual audience reaction too precious to be of constitutional significance . Both kinds of statutes clearly are aimed at protecting onlookers from being offended by the ideas expressed by the prohibited activity .	unmatched
Our inquiry is , of course , bounded by the particular facts of this case and by the statute under which Johnson was convicted . There was no evidence that Johnson himself stole the flag he burned , Tr . of Oral Arg . 17 , nor did the prosecution or the arguments urged in support of it depend on the theory that the flag was stolen . Ibid . Thus , our analysis does not rely on the way in which the flag was acquired , and nothing in our opinion should be taken to suggest that one is free to steal a flag so long as one later uses it to communicate an idea . We also emphasize that Johnson was prosecuted only for flag desecration -- not for trespass , disorderly conduct , or arson .	unmatched
Texas claims that " Texas is not endorsing , protecting , avowing or prohibiting any particular philosophy . " Brief for Petitioner 29 . If Texas means to suggest that its asserted interest does not prefer Democrats over Socialists , or Republicans over Democrats , for example , then it is beside the point , for Johnson does not rely on such an argument . He argues instead that the State 's desire to maintain the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity assumes that there is only one proper view of the flag . Thus , if Texas means to argue that its interest does not prefer any viewpoint over another , it is mistaken ; surely one 's attitude toward the flag and its referents is a viewpoint .	unmatched
Our decision in Halter v. Nebraska , 205 U.S. 34 ( 1907 ) , addressing the validity of a state law prohibiting certain commercial uses of the flag , is not to the contrary .

Washington , 418 U.S. 405 , 413 , n. 7 ( 1974 ) .

THE CHIEF JUSTlCE 's dissent appears to believe that Johnson 's conduct may be prohibited and , indeed , criminally sanctioned , because " his act . . . conveyed nothing that could not have been conveyed and was not conveyed just as forcefully in a dozen different ways .

Not only does this assertion sit uneasily next to the dissent 's quite correct reminder that the flag occupies a unique position in our society -- which demonstrates that messages conveyed without use of the flag are not " just as forcefu[l ] " as those conveyed with it -- but it also ignores the fact that , in Spence , supra , we " rejected summarily " this very claim .

I write not to qualify the words JUSTICE BRENNAN chooses so well , for he says with power all that is necessary to explain our ruling .

The case before us illustrates better than most that the judicial power is often difficult in its exercise . We can not here ask another Branch to share responsibility , as when the argument is made that a statute is flawed or incomplete . For we are presented with a clear and simple statute to be judged against a pure command of the Constitution . The outcome can be laid at no door but ours .	unmatched
The hard fact is that sometimes we must make decisions we do not like . We make them because they are right , right [ p421 ] in the sense that the law and the Constitution , as we see them , compel the result .

This is one of those rare cases .	unmatched
Our colleagues in dissent advance powerful arguments why respondent may be convicted for his expression , reminding us that among those who will be dismayed by our holding will be some who have had the singular honor of carrying the flag in battle . And I agree that the flag holds a lonely place of honor in an age when absolutes are distrusted and simple truths are burdened by unneeded apologetics .	unmatched
With all respect to those views , I do not believe the Constitution gives us the right to rule as the dissenting Members of the Court urge , however painful this judgment is to announce . Though symbols often are what we ourselves make of them , the flag is constant in expressing beliefs Americans share , beliefs in law and peace and that freedom which sustains the human spirit . The case here today forces recognition of the costs to which those beliefs commit us . It is poignant but fundamental that the flag protects those who hold it in contempt .	unmatched
For all the record shows , this respondent was not a philosopher and perhaps did not even possess the ability to comprehend how repellent his statements must be to the Republic itself .

The American flag , then , throughout more than 200 years of our history , has come to be the visible symbol embodying our Nation . It does not represent the views of any particular political party , and it does not represent any particular political philosophy . The flag is not simply another " idea " or " point of view " competing for recognition in the marketplace of ideas . Millions and millions of Americans regard it with an almost mystical reverence , regardless of what sort of social , political , or philosophical beliefs they may have . I can not agree that the First Amendment invalidates the Act of Congress , and the laws of 48 of the 50 States , which make criminal the public burning of the flag .	first_amendment
More than 80 years ago , in Halter v. Nebraska , 205 U.S. 34 ( 1907 ) , this Court upheld the constitutionality of a Nebraska statute that forbade the use of representations of the American flag for advertising purposes upon articles of merchandise . The Court there said :	unmatched

But the Court insists that the Texas statute prohibiting the public burning of the American flag infringes on respondent Johnson 's freedom of expression . Such freedom , of course , is not absolute . See Schenck v. United States , 249 U.S. 47 " ] 249 U.S. 47 ( 1919 ) . In 249 U.S. 47 ( 1919 ) . In Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire , 315 U.S. 568 ( 1942 ) , a unanimous Court said :	first_amendment
Id. at 571 - 572 ( footnotes omitted ) . The Court upheld Chaplinsky 's conviction under a state statute that made it unlawful to " address any offensive , derisive or annoying word to any person who is lawfully in any street or other public place .

Here it may equally well be said that the public burning of the American flag by Johnson was no essential part of any exposition of ideas , and at the same time it had a tendency to incite a breach of the peace . Johnson was free to make any verbal denunciation of the flag that he wished ; indeed , he was [ p431 ] free to burn the flag in private . He could publicly burn other symbols of the Government or effigies of political leaders . He did lead a march through the streets of Dallas , and conducted a rally in front of the Dallas City Hall . He engaged in a " die - in " to protest nuclear weapons . He shouted out various slogans during the march , including : " Reagan , Mondale which will it be ? Either one means World War III " ; " Ronald Reagan , killer of the hour , Perfect example of U.S. power " ; and " red , white and blue , we spit on you , you stand for plunder , you will go under . " Brief for Respondent 3 . For none of these acts was he arrested or prosecuted ; it was only when he proceeded to burn publicly an American flag stolen from its rightful owner that he violated the Texas statute .	unmatched
The Court could not , and did not , say that Chaplinsky 's utterances were not expressive phrases -- they clearly and succinctly conveyed an extremely low opinion of the addressee . The same may be said of Johnson 's public burning of the flag in this case ; it obviously did convey Johnson 's bitter dislike of his country . But his act , like Chaplinsky 's provocative words , conveyed nothing that could not have been conveyed and was not conveyed just as forcefully in a dozen different ways . As with " fighting words , " so with flag burning , for purposes of the First Amendment : It is	first_amendment
by the public interest in avoiding a probable breach of the peace . The highest courts of several States have upheld state statutes prohibiting the public burning of the flag on the grounds that it is so inherently inflammatory that it may cause a breach of public order . See , e.g. , State v. Royal , 113 N. H. 224 , 229 , 305 A.2d 676 , 680 ( 1973 ) ; State v. Waterman , 190 N.W.2d 809 , 811 - 812 ( Iowa 1971 ) ; see also State v. Mitchell , 32 Ohio App.2d 16 , 30 , 288 N.E.2d 216 , 226 ( 1972 ) . [ p432 ]	unmatched
The result of the Texas statute is obviously to deny one in Johnson 's frame of mind one of many means of " symbolic speech . " Far from being a case of " one picture being worth a thousand words , " flag burning is the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that , it seems fair to say , is most likely to be indulged in not to express any particular idea , but to antagonize others . Only five years ago we said in City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent , 466 U.S. 789 , 812 ( 1984 ) , that " the First Amendment does not guarantee the right to employ every conceivable method of communication at all times and in all places . " The Texas statute deprived Johnson of only one rather inarticulate symbolic form of protest -- a form of protest that was profoundly offensive to many -- and left him with a full panoply of other symbols and every conceivable form of verbal expression to express his deep disapproval of national policy . Thus , in no way can it be said that Texas is punishing him because his hearers -- or any other group of people -- were profoundly opposed to the message that he sought to convey . Such opposition is no proper basis for restricting speech or expression under the First Amendment . It was Johnson 's use of this particular symbol , and not the idea that he sought to convey by it or by his many other expressions , for which he was punished .	first_amendment
Our prior cases dealing with flag desecration statutes have left open the question that the Court resolves today . In Street v. New York , 394 U.S. 576 , 579 ( 1969 ) , the defendant burned a flag in the street , shouting " We do n't need no damned flag " and , " [ i]f they let that happen to Meredith , we do n't need an American flag . " The Court ruled that since the defendant might have been convicted solely on the basis of his words , the conviction could not stand , but it expressly reserved the question whether a defendant could constitutionally be convicted for burning the flag .

Id. at 605 . Justices Black and Fortas also expressed their personal view that a prohibition on flag burning did not violate the Constitution .

But the Court today will have none of this . The uniquely deep awe and respect for our flag felt by virtually all of us are bundled off under the rubric of " designated symbols , " ante at 417 , that the First Amendment prohibits the government from " establishing . " But the government has not " established " this feeling ; 200 years of history have done that . The government is simply recognizing as a fact the profound regard for the American flag created by that history when it enacts statutes prohibiting the disrespectful public burning of the flag .	first_amendment
The Court concludes its opinion with a regrettably patronizing civics lecture , presumably addressed to the Members of both Houses of Congress , the members of the 48 state legislatures that enacted prohibitions against flag burning , and the troops fighting under that flag in Vietnam who objected to its [ p435 ] being burned :	unmatched
Ante at 419 . The Court 's role as the final expositor of the Constitution is well established , but its role as a platonic guardian admonishing those responsible to public opinion as if they were truant schoolchildren has no similar place in our system of government . The cry of " no taxation without representation " animated those who revolted against the English Crown to found our Nation -- the idea that those who submitted to government should have some say as to what kind of laws would be passed . Surely one of the high purposes of a democratic society is to legislate against conduct that is regarded as evil and profoundly offensive to the majority of people -- whether it be murder , embezzlement , pollution , or flagburning .	unmatched
Our Constitution wisely places limits on powers of legislative majorities to act , but the declaration of such limits by this Court " is , at all times , a question of much delicacy , which ought seldom , if ever , to be decided in the affirmative , in a doubtful case . " Fletcher v. Peck , 6 Cranch 87 , 128 ( 1810 ) ( Marshall , C.J. ) . Uncritical extension of constitutional protection to the burning of the flag risks the frustration of the very purpose for which organized governments are instituted . The Court decides that the American flag is just another symbol , about which not only must opinions pro and con be tolerated , but for which the most minimal public respect may not be enjoined . The government may conscript men into the Armed Forces where they must fight and perhaps die for the flag , but the government may not prohibit the public burning of the banner under which they fight . I would uphold the Texas statute as applied in this case . [ n2 ] [ p436 ]	unmatched
JUSTICE STEVENS , dissenting .	unmatched
As the Court analyzes this case , it presents the question whether the State of Texas , or indeed the Federal Government , has the power to prohibit the public desecration of the American flag . The question is unique . In my judgment , rules that apply to a host of other symbols , such as state flags , armbands , or various privately promoted emblems of political or commercial identity , are not necessarily controlling . Even if flagburning could be considered just another species of symbolic speech under the logical application of the rules that the Court has developed in its interpretation of the First Amendment in other contexts , this case has an intangible dimension that makes those rules inapplicable .	first_amendment
A country 's flag is a symbol of more than " nationhood and national unity . " Ante at 407 , 410 , 413 , and n. 9 , 417 , 420 . It also signifies the ideas that characterize the society that has chosen that emblem as well as the special history that has animated the growth and power of those ideas . The fleurs - de - lis and the tricolor both symbolized " nationhood and national unity , " but they had vastly different meanings . The message conveyed by some flags -- the swastika , for example -- may survive long after it has outlived its usefulness as a symbol of regimented unity in a particular nation . [ p437 ]	unmatched
So it is with the American flag . It is more than a proud symbol of the courage , the determination , and the gifts of nature that transformed 13 fledgling Colonies into a world power . It is a symbol of freedom , of equal opportunity , of religious tolerance , and of goodwill for other peoples who share our aspirations . The symbol carries its message to dissidents both at home and abroad who may have no interest at all in our national unity or survival .	unmatched
The value of the flag as a symbol can not be measured . Even so , I have no doubt that the interest in preserving that value for the future is both significant and legitimate . Conceivably , that value will be enhanced by the Court 's conclusion that our national commitment to free expression is so strong that even the United States , as ultimate guarantor of that freedom , is without power to prohibit the desecration of its unique symbol . But I am unpersuaded . The creation of a federal right to post bulletin boards and graffiti on the Washington Monument might enlarge the market for free expression , but at a cost I would not pay . Similarly , in my considered judgment , sanctioning the public desecration of the flag will tarnish its value -- both for those who cherish the ideas for which it waves and for those who desire to don the robes of martyrdom by burning it . That tarnish is not justified by the trivial burden on free expression occasioned by requiring that an available , alternative mode of expression -- including uttering words critical of the flag , see Street v. New York , 394 U.S. 576 ( 1969 ) -- be employed .	first_amendment
It is appropriate to emphasize certain propositions that are not implicated by this case . The statutory prohibition of flag desecration does not	unmatched
West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette , 319 U.S. 624 , 642 ( 1943 ) . The statute does not compel any conduct or any profession of respect for any idea or any symbol . [ p438 ]	unmatched
Nor does the statute violate " the government 's paramount obligation of neutrality in its regulation of protected communication . " Young v. American Mini Theatres , Inc. , 427 U.S. 50 , 70 ( 1976 ) ( plurality opinion ) . The content of respondent 's message has no relevance whatsoever to the case . The concept of " desecration " does not turn on the substance of the message the actor intends to convey , but rather on whether those who view the act will take serious offense . Accordingly , one intending to convey a message of respect for the flag by burning it in a public square might nonetheless be guilty of desecration if he knows that others -- perhaps simply because they misperceive the intended message -- will be seriously offended . Indeed , even if the actor knows that all possible witnesses will understand that he intends to send a message of respect , he might still be guilty of desecration if he also knows that this understanding does not lessen the offense taken by some of those witnesses . Thus , this is not a case in which the fact that " it is the speaker 's opinion that gives offense " provides a special " reason for according it constitutional protection , " FCC v. Pacifica Foundation , 438 U.S. 726 , 745 ( 1978 ) ( plurality opinion ) . The case has nothing to do with " disagreeable ideas , " see ante at 409 . It involves disagreeable conduct that , in my opinion , diminishes the value of an important national asset .	unmatched
The Court is therefore quite wrong in blandly asserting that respondent	unmatched
Ante at 411 . Respondent was prosecuted because of the method he chose to express his dissatisfaction with those policies . Had he chosen to spraypaint -- or perhaps convey with a motion picture projector -- his message of dissatisfaction on the facade of the Lincoln Memorial , there would be no question about the power of the Government to prohibit his means of expression . The prohibition would be supported by the legitimate interest in preserving the quality of an important [ p439 ] national asset . Though the asset at stake in this case is intangible , given its unique value , the same interest supports a prohibition on the desecration of the American flag . [ * ]	unmatched
The ideas of liberty and equality have been an irresistible force in motivating leaders like Patrick Henry , Susan B. Anthony , and Abraham Lincoln , schoolteachers like Nathan Hale and Booker T. Washington , the Philippine Scouts who fought at Bataan , and the soldiers who scaled the bluff at Omaha Beach . If those ideas are worth fighting for -- and our history demonstrates that they are -- it can not be true that the flag that uniquely symbolizes their power is not itself worthy of protection from unnecessary desecration .	unmatched

The court thereafter issued an order for an in camera examination of the subpoenaed material , having rejected the President 's contentions ( a ) that the dispute between him and the Special Prosecutor was nonjusticiable as an " intra - executive " conflict and ( b ) that the judiciary lacked authority to review the President 's assertion of executive privilege .

From this Court 's examination of the material submitted by the Special Prosecutor in support of his motion for the subpoena , much of which is under seal , it is clear that the District Court 's denial of the motion to quash comported with Rule 17(c ) , and that the Special Prosecutor has made a sufficient showing to justify a subpoena for production before trial .

Neither the doctrine of separation of powers nor the generalized need for confidentiality of high - level communications , without more , can sustain an absolute , unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances .

Absent a claim of need to protect military , diplomatic , or sensitive national security secrets , the confidentiality of [ p685 ] Presidential communications is not significantly diminished by producing material for a criminal trial under the protected conditions of in camera inspection , and any absolute executive privilege under Art .

7 . Since a president 's communications encompass a vastly wider range of sensitive material than would be true of an ordinary individual , the public interest requires that Presidential confidentiality be afforded the greatest protection consistent with the fair administration of justice , and the District Court has a heavy responsibility to ensure that material involving Presidential conversations irrelevant to or inadmissible in the criminal prosecution be accorded the high degree of respect due a President , and that such material be returned under seal to its lawful custodian .

On March 1 , 1974 , a grand jury of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia returned an indictment charging seven named individuals [ n3 ] with various offenses , including conspiracy to defraud the United States and to obstruct justice . Although he was not designated as such in the indictment , the grand jury named the President , among others , as an unindicted coconspirator . [ n4 ] On April 18 , 1974 , upon motion of the Special [ p688 ] Prosecutor , see n. 8 , infra , a subpoena duces tecum was issued pursuant to Rule 17(c ) to the President by the United States District Court and made returnable on May 2 , 1974 . This subpoena required the production , in advance of the September 9 trial date , of certain tapes , memoranda , papers , transcripts , or other writings relating to certain precisely identified meetings between the President and others . [ n5 ] The Special Prosecutor was able to fix the time , place , and persons present at these discussions because the White House daily logs and appointment records had been delivered to him . On April 30 , the President publicly released edited transcripts of 43 conversations ; portions of 20 conversations subject to subpoena in the present case were included . On May 1 , 1974 , the President 's counsel filed a " special appearance " and a motion to quash the subpoena under Rule 17(c ) . This motion was accompanied by a formal claim of privilege . At a subsequent hearing , [ n6 ] further motions to expunge the grand jury 's action naming the President as an unindicted coconspirator and for protective orders against the disclosure of that information were filed or raised orally by counsel for the President .	unmatched
On May 20 , 1974 , the District Court denied the motion to quash and the motions to expunge and for protective orders . 377 F.Supp . 1326 . It further ordered " the President or any subordinate officer , official , or employee with custody or control of the documents or [ p689 ] objects subpoenaed , " i d . at 1331 , to deliver to the District Court , on or before May 31 , 1974 , the originals of all subpoenaed items , as well as an index and analysis of those items , together with tape copies of those portions of the subpoenaed recordings for which transcripts had been released to the public by the President on April 30 . The District Court rejected jurisdictional challenges based on a contention that the dispute was nonjusticiable because it was between the Special Prosecutor and the Chief Executive and hence " intra - executive " in character ; it also rejected the contention that the Judiciary was without authority to review an assertion of executive privilege by the President . The court 's rejection of the first challenge was based on the authority and powers vested in the Special Prosecutor by the regulation promulgated by the Attorney General ; the court concluded that a justiciable controversy was presented . The second challenge was held to be foreclosed by the decision in Nixon v. Sirica , 159 U.S.App . D.C. 58 , 487 F.2d 700 ( 1973 ) .	unmatched
The District Court held that the judiciary , not the President , was the final arbiter of a claim of executive privilege .

The threshold question presented is whether the May 20 , 1974 , order of the District Court was an appealable order and whether this case was properly " in " the Court of Appeals when the petition for certiorari was filed in this Cort . 28 U.S.C. § 1254 . The Court of Appeals ' jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 encompasses only " final decisions of the district courts .

The finality requirement of 28 U.S.C. § 1291 embodies a strong congressional policy against piecemeal reviews , and against obstructing or impeding an ongoing judicial proceeding by interlocutory appeals . See , e.g. , Cobbledick v. United States , 309 U.S. 323 , 324 - 326 ( 1940 ) . This requirement ordinarily promotes judicial efficiency and hastens the ultimate termination of litigation . In applying this principle to an order denying a motion to quash and requiring the production of evidence pursuant [ p691 ] to a subpoena duces tecum , it has been repeatedly held that the order is not final , and hence not appealable . United States v. Ryan , 402 U.S. 530 , 532 ( 1971 ) ; Cobbledick v. United States , supra ; Alexander v. United States , 201 U.S. 117 ( 1906 ) . This Court has	unmatched
United States v. Ryan , supra , at 533 .	unmatched
The requirement of submitting to contempt , however , is not without exception , and in some instances the purposes underlying the finality rule require a different result . For example , in Perlman v. United States , 247 U.S. 7 ( 1918 ) , a subpoena had been directed to a third party requesting certain exhibits ; the appellant , who owned the exhibits , sought to raise a claim of privilege . The Court held an order compelling production was appealable because it was unlikely that the third party would risk a contempt citation in order to allow immediate review of the appellant 's claim of privilege . Id. at 12 - 13 . That case fell within the " limited class of cases where denial of immediate review would render impossible any review whatsoever of an individual 's claims . " United States v. Ryan , supra , at 533 .	unmatched
Here too , the traditional contempt avenue to immediate appeal is peculiarly inappropriate due to the unique setting in which the question arises . To require a President of the United States to place himself in the posture of disobeying an order of a court merely to trigger the procedural mechanism for review of the ruling would be [ p692 ] unseemly , and would present an unnecessary occasion for constitutional confrontation between two branches of the Government . Similarly , a federal judge should not be placed in the posture of issuing a citation to a President simply in order to invoke review . The issue whether a President can be cited for contempt could itself engender protracted litigation , and would further delay both review on the merits of his claim of privilege and the ultimate termination of the underlying criminal action for which his evidence is sought . These considerations lead us to conclude that the order of the District Court was an appealable order . The appeal from that order was therefore properly " in " the Court of Appeals , and the case is now properly before this Court on the writ of certiorari before judgment . 28 U.S.C. § 1254 ; 28 U.S.C. § 2101(e ) .

IIJUSTICIABILITY	unmatched
In the District Court , the President 's counsel argued that the court lacked jurisdiction to issue the subpoena because the matter was an intra - branch dispute between a subordinate and superior officer of the Executive Branch , and hence not subject to judicial resolution . That argument has been renewed in this Court with emphasis on the contention that the dispute does not present a " case " or " controversy " which can be adjudicated in the federal courts . The President 's counsel argues that the federal courts should not intrude into areas committed to the other branches of Government . [ p693 ] He views the present dispute as essentially a " jurisdictional " dispute within the Executive Branch which he analogizes to a dispute between two congressional committees . Since the Executive Branch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case , Confiscation Cases , 7 Wall . 454 ( 1869 ) ; United States v. Cox , 342 F.2d 167 , 171 ( CA5 ) , cert . denied sub nom . Cox v. Hauber , 381 U.S. 935 ( 1965 ) , it is contended that a President 's decision is final in determining what evidence is to be used in a given criminal case . Although his counsel concedes that the President ha delegated certain specific powers to the Special Prosecutor , he has not	articleiii#section2
Brief for the President 42 . The Special Prosecutor 's demand for the items therefore presents , in the view of the President 's counsel , a political question under Baker v.

The mere assertion of a claim of an " intra - branch dispute , " without more , has never operated to defeat federal jurisdiction ; justiciability does not depend on such a surface inquiry . In United States v. ICC , 337 U.S. 426 ( 1949 ) , the Court observed , " courts must look behind names that symbolize the parties to determine whether a justiciable case or controversy is presented . " Id. at 430 . See also Powell v. McCormack , 395 U.S. 486 ( 1969 ) ; ICC v. Jersey City , 322 U.S. 503 ( 1944 ) ; United States ex rel . Chapman v. FPC , 345 U.S. 153 ( 1953 ) ; Secretary of Agriculture v. United States , 347 U.S. 645 ( 1954 ) ; FMB v. Isbrandtsen Co. , 356 U.S. 481 , 483 n. 2 ( 1958 ) ; United States v. Marine Bancorporation , ante , p. 602 ; and United States v. Connecticut National Bank , ante , p. 656 . [ p694 ]	unmatched
Our starting point is the nature of the proceeding for which the evidence is sought -- here , a pending criminal prosecution . It is a judicial proceeding in a federal court alleging violation of federal laws , and is brought in the name of the United States as sovereign . Berger v. United States , 295 U.S. 78 , 88 ( 1935 ) . Under the authority of Art . II , § 2 , Congress has vested in the Attorney General the power to conduct the criminal litigation of the United States Government . 28 U.S.C. § 516 . It has also vested in him the power to appoint subordinate officers to assist him in the discharge of his duties . 28 U.S.C. § § 509 510 , 515 , 533 . Acting pursuant to those statutes , the Attorney General has delegated the authority to represent the United States in these particular matters to a Special Prosecutor with unique authority and tenure . [ n8 ] The regulation gives the [ p695 ] Special Prosecutor explicit power to contest the invocation of executive privilege in the process of seeking evidence deemed relevant to the performance of these specially delegated duties . [ n9 ] 38 Fed . Reg . 30739 , as amended by 38 Fed . Reg . 32805 .	articleii#section2
So long as this regulation is extant , it has the force of law . In United States ex rel . Accardi v. Shaughnessy , 347 U.S. 260 ( 1954 ) , regulations of the Attorney General delegated certain of his discretionary powers to the Board [ p696 ] of Immigration Appeals and required that Board to exercise its own discretion on appeals in deportation cases . The Court held that , so long as the Attorney General 's regulations remained operative , he denied himself the authority to exercise the discretion delegated to the Board even though the original authority was his and he could reassert it by amending the regulations . Service v. Dulles , 354 U.S. 363 , 388 ( 1957 ) , and Vitarelli v. Seaton , 359 U.S. 535 ( 1959 ) , reaffirmed the basic holding of Accardi .	unmatched
Here , as in Accardi , it is theoretically possible for the Attorney General to amend or revoke the regulation defining the Special Prosecutor 's authority . But he has not done so . [ n10 ] So long as this regulation remains in force , the Executive Branch is bound by it , and indeed the United States , as the sovereign composed of the three branches , is bound to respect and to enforce it . Moreover , the delegation of authority to the Special Prosecutor in this case is not an ordinary delegation by the Attorney General to a subordinate officer : with the authorization of the President , the Acting Attorney General provided in the regulation that the Special Prosecutor was not to be removed without the " consensus " of eight designated leaders of Congress . N. 8 , supra .	unmatched
The demands of and the resistance to the subpoena present an obvious controversy in the ordinary sense , but that alone is not sufficient to meet constitutional standards . In the constitutional sense , controversy means more than disagreement and conflict ; rather it means the kind of controversy courts traditionally resolve . Here [ p697 ] at issue is the production or nonproduction of specified evidence deemed by the Special Prosecutor to be relevant and admissible in a pending criminal case . It is sought by one official of the Executive Branch within the scope of his express authority ; it is resisted by the Chief Executive on the ground of his duty to preserve the confidentiality of the communications of the President . Whatever the correct answer on the merits , these issues are " of a type which are traditionally justiciable . " United States v. ICC , 337 U.S. at 430 . The independent Special Prosecutor , with his asserted need for the subpoenaed material in the underlying criminal prosecution , is opposed by the President , with his steadfast assertion of privilege against disclosure of the material . This setting assures there is	unmatched

In light of the uniqueness of the setting in which the conflict arises , the fact that both parties are officer of the Executive Branch can not be viewed as a barrier to justiciability . It would be inconsistent with the applicable law and regulation , and the unique facts of this case , to conclude other than that the Special Prosecutor has standing to bring this action , and that a justiciable controversy is presented for decision .	unmatched
The subpoena duces tecum is challenged on the ground that the Special Prosecutor failed to satisfy the requirements of Fed . Rule Crim . Proc . 17(c ) , which governs [ p698 ] the issuance of subpoenas duces tecum in federal criminal proceedings . If we sustained this challenge , there would be no occasion to reach the claim of privilege asserted with respect to the subpoenaed material . Thus , we turn to the question whether the requirements of Rule 17(c ) have been satisfied . See Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. v. Dept . of Public Utilities , 304 U.S. 61 , 64 ( 1938 ) ; Ashwander v. TVA , 297 U.S. 288 , 346 - 347 ( 1936 ) ( Brandeis , J. , concurring ) .	unmatched
Rule 17(c ) provides :	unmatched
A subpoena for documents may be quashed if their production would be " unreasonable or oppressive , " but not otherwise . The leading case in this Court interpreting this standard is Bowman Dairy Co. v. United States , 341 U.S. 214 ( 1951 ) . This case recognized certain fundamental characteristics of the subpoena duces tecum in criminal cases : ( 1 ) it was not intended to provide a means of discovery for criminal cases , i d . at 220 ; ( 2 ) its chief innovation was to expedite the trial by providing a time and place before trial for the inspection of [ p699 ] subpoenaed materials , [ n11 ] ibid . As both parties agree , cases decided in the wake of Bowman have generally followed Judge Weinfeld 's formulation in United States v. Iozia , 13 F.R.D. 335 , 338 ( SDNY 1952 ) , as to the required showing . Under this test , in order to require production prior to trial , the moving party must show : ( 1 ) that the documents are evidentiary [ n12 ] and relevant ; ( 2 ) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence ; ( 3 ) that the party can not properly prepare for trial without such production and inspection in advance of trial , and that the failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial ; and ( 4 ) that [ p700 ] the application is made in good faith and is not intended as a general " fishing expedition . "	unmatched
Against this background , the Special Prosecutor , in order to carry his burden , must clear three hurdles : ( 1 ) relevancy ; ( 2 ) admissibility ; ( 3 ) specificity . Our own review of the record necessarily affords a less comprehensive view of the total situation than was available to the trial judge , and we are unwilling to conclude that the District Court erred in the evaluation of the Special Prosecutor 's showing under Rule 17(c ) . Our conclusion is based on the record before us , much of which is under seal . Of course , the contents of the subpoenaed tapes could not at that stage be described fully by the Special Prosecutor , but there was a sufficient likelihood that each of the tapes contains conversations relevant to the offenses charged in the indictment . United States v. Gross , 24 F.R.D. 138 ( SDNY 1959 ) . With respect to many of the tapes , the Special Prosecutor offered the sworn testimony or statements of one or more of the participants in the conversations as to what was said at the time . As for the remainder of the tapes , the identity of the participants and the time and place of the conversations , taken in their total context , permit a rational inference that at least part of the conversations relate to the offenses charged in the indictment .	unmatched
We also conclude there was a sufficient preliminary showing that each of the subpoenaed tapes contains evidence admissible with respect to the offenses charged in the indictment . The most cogent objection to the admissibility of the taped conversations here at issue is that they are a collection of out - of - court statements by declarants who will not be subject to cross - examination , and that the statements are therefore inadmissible hearsay . Here , however , most of the tapes apparently contain conversations [ p701 ] to which one or more of the defendant named in the indictment were party . The hearsay rule does not automatically bar all out - of - court statements by a defendant in a criminal case . [ n13 ] Declarations by one defendant may also be admissible against other defendant upon a sufficient showing , by independent evidence , [ n14 ] of a conspiracy among one or more other defendants and the declarant and if the declarations at issue were in furtherance of that conspiracy . The same is true of declarations of coconspirators who are not defendants in the case on trial . Dutton v. Evans , 400 U.S. 74 , 81 ( 1970 ) . Recorded conversations may also be admissible for the limited purpose of impeaching the credibility of any defendant who testifies or any other coconspirator who testifies . Generally , the need for evidence to impeach witnesses is insufficient to require its production in advance of trial . See , e.g. , United States v. Carter , 15 F.R.D. 367 , [ p702 ] 371 ( DC 1954 ) . Here , however , there are other valid potential evidentiary uses for the same material , and the analysis and possible transcription of the tapes may take a significant period of time . Accordingly , we can not conclude that the District Court erred in authorizing the issuance of the subpoena duces tecum .	unmatched
Enforcement of a pretrial subpoena duces tecum must necessarily be committed to the sound discretion of the trial court , since the necessity for the subpoena most often turns upon a determination of factual issues . Without a determination of arbitrariness or that the trial court finding was without record support , an appellate court will not ordinarily disturb a finding that the applicant for a subpoena complied with Rule 17(c ) . See , e.g. , Sue v. Chicago Transit Authority , 279 F.2d 416 , 419 ( CA7 1960 ) ; Shotkin v. Nelson , 146 F.2d 402 ( CA10 1944 ) .	unmatched
In a case such as this , however , where a subpoena is directed to a President of the United States , appellate review , in deference to a coordinate branch of Government , should be particularly meticulous to ensure that the standards of Rule 17(c ) have been correctly applied . United States v. Burr , 25 F.Cas . 30 , 34 ( No . 14,692d ) ( CC Va. 1807 ) . From our examination of the materials submitted by the Special Prosecutor to the District Court in support of his motion for the subpoena , we are persuaded that the District Court 's denial of the President 's motion to quash the subpoena was consistent with Rule 17(c ) . We also conclude that the Special Prosecutor has made a sufficient showing to justify a subpoena for production before trial . The subpoenaed materials are not available from any other source , and their examination and processing should not await trial in the circumstances shown . Bowman Dairy Co. v. United States , 341 U.S. 214 ( 1951 ) ; United States v. Iozia , 13 F.R.D. 335 ( SDNY 1952 ) . [ p703 ]	unmatched
IVTHE CLAIM OF PRIVILEGE A	unmatched
Having determined that the requirements of Rule 17(c ) were satisfied , we turn to the claim that the subpoena should be quashed because it demands " confidential conversations between a President and his close advisors that it would be inconsistent with the public interest to produce . " App . 48a . The first contention is a broad claim that the separation of powers doctrine precludes judicial review of a President 's claim of privilege . The second contention is that , if he does not prevail on the claim of absolute privilege , the court should hold as a matter of constitutional law that the privilege prevails over the subpoena duces tecum .	unmatched
In the performance of assigned constitutional duties , each branch of the Government must initially interpret the Constitution , and the interpretation of its powers by any branch is due great respect from the others . The President 's counsel , as we have noted , reads the Constitution as providing an absolute privilege of confidentiality for all Presidential communications . Many decisions of this Court , however , have unequivocally reaffirmed the holding of Marbury v. Madison , 1 Cranch 137 ( 1803 ) , that " [ i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is . " Id. at 177 . No holding of the Court has defined the scope of judicial power specifically relating to the enforcement of a subpoena for confidential Presidential communications for use in a criminal prosecution , but other exercises of power by the Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch have been found invalid as in conflict with the Constitution . Powell v. McCormack , 395 U.S. 486 ( 1969 ) ; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer , 343 U.S. 579 ( 1952 ) . In a [ p704 ] series of cases , the Court interpreted the explicit immunity conferred by express provisions of the Constitution on Members of the House and Senate by the Speech or Debate Clause , U.S.Const . Art . I , § 6 . Doe v. McMillan , 412 U.S. 306 ( 1973 ) ; Gravel v. United States , 408 U.S. 606 ( 1972 ) ; United States v. Brewster , 408 U.S. 501 ( 1972 ) ; United States v. Johnson 383 U.S. 169 ( 1966 ) . Since this Court has consistently exercised the power to construe and delineate claims arising under express powers , it must follow that the Court has authority to interpret claims with respect to powers alleged to derive from enumerated powers .	articlei#section6
Our system of government	unmatched

Notwithstanding the deference each branch must accord the others , the " judicial Power of the United States " vested in the federal courts by Art . III , § 1 , of the Constitution can no more be shared with the Executive Branch than the Chief Executive , for example , can share with the Judiciary the veto power , or the Congress share with the Judiciary the power to override a Presidential veto . Any other conclusion would be contrary to the basic concept of separation of powers and the checks and balances that flow from the scheme of a tripartite government . The Federalist , No . 47 , p. 313 ( S. Mittell ed . [ p705 ] 1938 ) . We therefore reaffirm that it is the province and duty of this Court " to say what the law is " with respect to the claim of privilege presented in this case . Marbury v. Madison , supra at 177 .	articleiii#section1,articlei#section7
In support of his claim of absolute privilege , the President 's counsel urges two grounds , one of which is common to all governments and one of which is peculiar to our system of separation of powers . The first ground is the valid need for protection of communications between high Government officials and those who advise and assist them in the performance of their manifold duties ; the importance of this confidentiality is too plain to require further discussion . Human experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of the decisionmaking process . [ n15 ] Whatever the nature of the privilege of confidentiality of Presidential communications in the exercise of Art . II powers , the privilege can be said to derive from the supremacy of each branch within its own assigned area of constitutional duties . Certain powers and privileges flow from the nature of enumerated powers ; [ n16 ] the protection of the confidentiality of [ p706 ] Presidential communications has similar constitutional underpinnings .	articleii#section3,articleii#section2,articleii#section1
The second ground asserted by the President 's counsel in support of the claim of absolute privilege rests on the doctrine of separation of powers . Here it is argued that the independence of the Executive Branch within its own sphere , Humphrey 's Executor v. United States , 295 U.S. 602 , 629 - 630 ( 1935 ) ; Kilbourn v. Thompson , 103 U.S. 168 , 190 - 191 ( 1881 ) , insulates a President from a judicial subpoena in an ongoing criminal prosecution , and thereby protects confidential Presidential communications .	unmatched
However , neither the doctrine of separation of powers nor the need for confidentiality of high - level communications , without more , can sustain an absolute , unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances . The President 's need for complete candor and objectivity from advisers calls for great deference from the courts . However , when the privilege depends solely on the broad , undifferentiated claim of public interest in the confidentiality of such conversations , a confrontation with other values arises . Absent a claim of need to protect military , diplomatic , or sensitive national security secrets , we find it difficult to accept the argument that even the very important interest in confidentiality of Presidential communications is significantly diminished by production of such material for in camera inspection with all the protection that a district court will be obliged to provide . [ p707 ]	unmatched
The impediment that an absolute , unqualified privilege would place in the way of the primary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch to do justice in criminal prosecutions would plainly conflict with the function of the courts under Art . III . In designing the structure of our Government and dividing and allocating the sovereign power among three co - equal branches , the Framers of the Constitution sought to provide a comprehensive system , but the separate powers were not intended to operate with absolute independence .	articleiii#section1,articleiii#section2
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer , 343 U.S. at 635 ( Jackson , J. , concurring ) . To read the Art . II powers of the President as providing an absolute privilege as against a subpoena essential to enforcement of criminal statutes on no more than a generalized claim of the public interest in confidentiality of nonmilitary and nondiplomatic discussions would upset the constitutional balance of " a workable government " and gravely impair the role of the courts under Art . III .	articleiii#section2,articleii#section1,articleii#section3,articleiii#section1,articleii#section2
Since we conclude that the legitimate needs of the judicial process may outweigh Presidential privilege , it is necessary to resolve those competing interests in a manner that preserves the essential functions of each branch . The right and indeed the duty to resolve that question does not free the Judiciary from according high respect to the representations made on behalf of the President . United States v. Burr , 25 F.Cas . 187 , 190 , 191 - 192 ( No . 14,694 ) ( CC Va. 1807 ) . [ p708 ]	unmatched
The expectation of a President to the confidentiality of his conversations and correspondence , like the claim of confidentiality of judicial deliberations , for example , has all the values to which we accord deference for the privacy of all citizens and , added to those values , is the necessity for protection of the public interest in candid , objective , and even blunt or harsh opinions in Presidential decisionmaking . A President and those who assist him must be free to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making decisions , and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except privately . These are the considerations justifying a presumptive privilege for Presidential communications . The privilege is fundamental to the operation of Government , and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution . [ n17 ] In Nixon v. Sirica , 159 U.S.App . D.C. 58 , 487 F.2d 700 ( 1973 ) , the Court of Appeals held that such Presidential communications are " presumptively privileged , " i d . at 75 , 487 F.2d at 717 , and this position is accepted by both parties in the present litigation . We agree with Mr. Chief Justice Marshall 's observation , therefore , that " [ i]n no case of his kind would a court be required to proceed against the president as against an ordinary individual . " United States v. Burr , 25 F.Cas . at 192 .	unmatched
But this presumptive privilege must be considered in light of our historic commitment to the rule of law . This [ p709 ] is nowhere more profoundly manifest than , in our view , that " the twofold aim [ of criminal justice ] is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer . " Berger v. United States , 295 U.S. at 88 . We have elected to employ an adversary system of criminal justice in which the parties contest all issues before a court of law . The need to develop all relevant facts in the adversary system is both fundamental and comprehensive . The ends of criminal justice would be defeated if judgments were to be founded on a partial or speculative presentation of the facts . The very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system depend on full disclosure of all the facts , within the framework of the rules of evidence . To ensure that justice is done , it is imperative to the function of courts that compulsory process be available for the production of evidence needed either by the prosecution or by the defense .	unmatched
Only recently the Court restated the ancient proposition of law , albeit in the context of a grand jury inquiry , rather than a trial ,	unmatched
Branzburg v. Hayes , 408 U.S. 665 , 688 ( 1972 ) . The privileges referred to by the Court are designed to protect weighty and legitimate competing interests . Thus , the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution provides that no man " shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . " And , generally , an attorney or a priest may not be required to disclose what has been revealed in professional confidence . These and other interests are recognized in law by privileges [ p710 ] against forced disclosure , established in the Constitution , by statute , or at common law . Whatever their origins , these exceptions to the demand for every man 's evidence are not lightly created nor expansively construed , for they are in derogation of the search for truth . [ n18 ]	fifth_amendment
In this case , the President challenges a subpoena served on him as a third party requiring the production of materials for use in a criminal prosecution ; he does so on the claim that he has a privilege against disclosure of confidential communications . He does not place his claim of privilege on the ground they are military or diplomatic secrets . As to these areas of Art . II duties , the courts have traditionally shown the utmost deference to Presidential responsibilities . In C. & S. Air Lines v. Waterman S.S. Corp. , 333 U.S. 103 , 111 ( 1948 ) , dealing with Presidential authority involving foreign policy considerations , the Court said :	articleii#section3,articleii#section2,articleii#section1
In United States v. Reynolds , 345 U.S. 1 ( 1953 ) , dealing [ p711 ] with a claimant 's demand for evidence in a Tort Claims Act case against the Government , the Court said :	unmatched
Id. at 10 . No case of the Court , however , has extended this high degree of deference to a President 's generalized interest in confidentiality . Nowhere in the Constitution , as we have noted earlier , is there any explicit reference to a privilege of confidentiality , yet to the extent this interest relates to the effective discharge of a President 's powers , it is constitutionally based .	unmatched
The right to the production of all evidence at a criminal trial similarly has constitutional dimensions . The Sixth Amendment explicitly confers upon every defendant in a criminal trial the right " to be confronted with the witnesses against him " and " to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor . " Moreover , the Fifth Amendment also guarantees that no person shall be deprived of liberty without due process of law . It is the manifest duty of the courts to vindicate those guarantees , and to accomplish that it is essential that all relevant and admissible evidence be produced .	sixth_amendment,fifth_amendment
In this case , we must weigh the importance of the general privilege of confidentiality of Presidential communications in performance of the President 's responsibilities against the inroads of such a privilege on the fair [ p712 ] administration of criminal justice . [ n19 ] The interest in preserving confidentiality is weighty indeed , and entitled to great respect . However , we can not conclude that advisers will be moved to temper the candor of their remarks by the infrequent occasions of disclosure because of the possibility that such conversations will be called for in the context of a criminal prosecution . [ n20 ]	unmatched
On the other hand , the allowance of the privilege to withhold evidence that is demonstrably relevant in a criminal trial would cut deeply into the guarantee of due process of law and gravely impair the basic function of the court . A President 's acknowledged need for confidentiality [ p713 ] in the communications of his office is general in nature , whereas the constitutional need for production of relevant evidence in a criminal proceeding is specific and central to the fair adjudication of a particular criminal case in the administration of justice . Without access to specific facts , a criminal prosecution may be totally frustrated . The President 's broad interest in confidentiality of communications will not be vitiated by disclosure of a limited number of conversations preliminarily shown to have some bearing on the pending criminal cases .	unmatched
We conclude that , when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality , it can not prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice . The generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated , specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial .	unmatched
We have earlier determined that the District Court did not err in authorizing the issuance of the subpoena . If a President concludes that compliance with a subpoena would be injurious to the public interest , he may properly , as was done here , invoke a claim of privilege on the return of the subpoena . Upon receiving a claim of privilege from the Chief Executive , it became the further duty of the District Court to treat the subpoenaed material as presumptively privileged and to require the Special Prosecutor to demonstrate that the Presidential material was " essential to the justice of the [ pending criminal ] case . " United States v. Burr , 25 F.Cas . at 192 . Here , the District Court treated the material as presumptively privileged , proceeded to find that the Special [ p714 ] Prosecutor had made a sufficient showing to rebut the presumption , and ordered an in camera examination of the subpoenaed material . On the basis of our examination of the record , we are unable to conclude that the District Court erred in ordering the inspection . Accordingly , we affirm the order of the District Court that subpoenaed materials be transmitted to that court . We now turn to the important question of the District Court 's responsibilities in conducting the in camera examination of Presidential materials or communications delivered under the compulsion of the subpoena duces tecum .	unmatched
Enforcement of the subpoena duces tecum was stayed pending this Court 's resolution of the issues raised by the petitions for certiorari . Those issues now having been disposed of , the matter of implementation will rest with the District Court .	unmatched
United States v. Burr , 25 F.Cas . at 34 . Statements that meet the test of admissibility and relevance must be isolated ; all other material must be excised . At this stage , the District Court is not limited to representations of the Special Prosecutor as to the evidence sought by the subpoena ; the material will be available to the District Court . It is elementary that in camera inspection of evidence is always a procedure calling for scrupulous protection against any release or publication of material not found by the court , at that stage , probably admissible in evidence and relevant to the issues of the trial for which it is sought . That being true of an ordinary situation , it is obvious that the District Court has [ p715 ] a very heavy responsibility to see to it that Presidential conversations , which are either not relevant or not admissible , are accorded that high degree of respect due the President of the United States . Mr. Chief Justice Marshall , sitting as a trial judge in the Burr case , supra , was extraordinarily careful to point out that	unmatched
25 F.Cas . at 192 . Marshall 's statement can not be read to mean in any sense that a President is above the law , but relates to the singularly unique role under Art . II of a President 's communications and activities , related to the performance of duties under that Article . Moreover , a President 's communications and activities encompass a vastly wider range of sensitive material than would be true of any " ordinary individual . " It is therefore necessary [ n21 ] in the public interest to afford Presidential confidentiality the greatest protection consistent with the fair administration of justice . The need for confidentiality even as to idle conversations with associates in which casual reference might be made concerning political leaders within the country or foreign statesmen is too obvious to call for further treatment . We have no doubt that the District Judge will at all times accord to Presidential records that high degree of deference suggested in United States v. Burr , supra , and will discharge his responsibility to see to [ p716 ] it that , until released to the Special Prosecutor , no in camera material is revealed to anyone . This burden applies with even greater force to excised material ; once the decision is made to excise , the material is restored to its privileged status , and should be returned under seal to its lawful custodian .	articleii#section3,articleii#section2,articleii#section1

The cross - petition in No . 73 - 1824 raised the issue whether the grand jury acted within its authority in naming the President as an unindicted coconspirator . Since we find resolution of this issue unnecessary to resolution of the question whether the claim of privilege is to prevail , the cross - petition for certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted and the remainder of this opinion is concerned with the issues raised in No . 73 - 1766 . On June 19 , 1974 , the President 's counsel moved for disclosure and transmittal to this Court of all evidence presented to the grand jury relating to its action in naming the President as an unindicted coconspirator . Action on this motion was deferred pending oral argument of the case , and is now denied .	unmatched
The seven defendants were John N. Mitchell , H. R. Haldeman , John D. Ehrlichman , Charles W. Colson , Robert C. Mardian , Kenneth W. Parkinson , and Gordon Strachan . Each has occupied either a position of responsibility on the White House Staff or a position with the Committee for the Re - election of the President . Colson entered a guilty plea on another charge , and is no longer a defendant .	unmatched
The President entered a special appearance in the District Court on June 6 and requested that court to lift its protective order regarding the naming of certain individuals as coconspirators and to any additional extent deemed appropriate by the Court . This motion of the President was based on the ground that the disclosures to the news media made the reasons for continuance of the protective order no longer meaningful . On June 7 , the District Court removed its protective order and , on June 10 , counsel for both parties jointly moved this Court to unseal those parts of the record which related to the action of the grand jury regarding the President . After receiving a statement in opposition from the defendants , this Court denied that motion on June 15 , 1974 , except for the grand jury 's immediate finding relating to the status of the President as an unindicted coconspirator . 417 U.S. 960 .	unmatched

Because of the key role of the testimony of witnesses in the judicial process , courts have historically been cautious about privileges . Mr. Justice Frankfurter , dissenting in Elkins v. United States , 364 U.S. 206 , 234 ( 1960 ) , said of this :	unmatched
We are not here concerned with the balance between the President 's generalized interest in confidentiality and the need for relevant evidence in civil litigation , nor with that between the confidentiality interest and congressional demands for information , nor with the President 's interest in preserving state secrets .
