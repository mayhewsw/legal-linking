The Original Understanding, 2 Stan.L.Rev. 5 (1949)), but on the thesis that, by limiting the content of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the protection of rights which can be found elsewhere in the Constitution, in this instance, in the Bill of Rights, judges will thus be confined to \"interpretation\" of specific constitutional \n[p501]\n provisions, and will thereby be restrained from introducing their own notions of constitutional right and wrong into the \"vague contours of the Due Process Clause.\"  Rochin v.

It is purely fanciful to believe that the broad proscription on use facilitates discovery of use by persons engaging in a prohibited relationship, or for some other reason makes such use more unlikely, and thus can be supported by any sort of administrative consideration.  Perhaps the theory is that the flat ban on use prevents married people from possessing contraceptives and, without the ready availability of such devices for use in the marital relationship, there will be no or less temptation to use them in extramarital ones.  This reasoning rests on the premise that married people will comply with the ban in regard to their marital relationship, notwithstanding total nonenforcement in this context and apparent nonenforcibility, but will not comply with criminal statutes prohibiting extramarital affairs and the anti-use statute in respect to illicit sexual relationships, a premise whose validity has not been \n[p507]\n demonstrated and whose intrinsic validity is not very evident.  At most, the broad ban is of marginal utility to the declared objective.  A statute limiting its prohibition on use to persons engaging in the prohibited relationship would serve the end posited by Connecticut in the same way, and with the same effectiveness or ineffectiveness, as the broad anti-use statute under attack in this case.

See, e.g., Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536, 554-555; Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559, 563-564; id. 575-584 (concurring opinion); Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U.S. 490; cf. Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 163-164.  The two defendants here were active participants in an organization which gave physical examinations to women, advised them what kind of contraceptive devices or medicines would most likely be satisfactory for them, and then supplied the devices themselves, all for a graduated scale of fees, based on the family income.  Thus, these defendants admittedly engaged with others in a planned course of conduct to help people violate the Connecticut law.  Merely because some speech was used in carrying on that conduct -- just as, in ordinary life, some speech accompanies most kinds of conduct -- we are not, in my view, justified in holding that the First Amendment forbids the State to punish their conduct.  Strongly as I desire to protect all First Amendment freedoms, I am unable to stretch the Amendment so as to afford protection to the conduct of these defendants in violating the Connecticut law.  What would be the constitutional fate of the law if hereafter applied to punish nothing but speech is, as I have said, quite another matter.  The Court talks about a constitutional \"right of privacy\" as though there is some constitutional provision or provisions forbidding any law ever to be passed which might abridge the \"privacy\" of individuals.  But there is not.  There are, of course, guarantees in certain specific constitutional provisions which are designed in part to protect privacy at certain times and places with respect to certain activities.  Such, for example, is the Fourth \n[p509]\n Amendment's guarantee against \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\"  But I think it belittles that Amendment to talk about it as though it protects nothing but \"privacy.\"  To treat it that way is to give it a niggardly interpretation, not the kind of liberal reading I think any Bill of Rights provision should be given.  The average man would very likely not have his feelings soothed any more by having his property seized openly than by having it seized privately and by stealth.  He simply wants his property left alone.  And a person can be just as much, if not more, irritated, annoyed and injured by an unceremonious public arrest by a policeman as he is by a seizure in the privacy of his office or home.", "meta": {"id": 76, "doc_type": null, "date": null, "source_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/381/479"}}

I have expressed the view many times that First Amendment freedoms, for example, have suffered from a failure of the courts to stick to the simple language of the First Amendment in construing it, instead of invoking multitudes of words substituted for those the Framers used.

My disagreement with the Court's opinion holding that there is such a violation here is a narrow one, relating to the application of the First Amendment to the facts and circumstances of this particular case.  But my disagreement with Brothers HARLAN, WHITE and GOLDBERG is more basic.  I think that, if properly construed, neither the Due Process Clause nor the Ninth Amendment, nor both together, could under any circumstances be a proper basis for invalidating the Connecticut law.

The power to make such decisions is, of course, that of a legislative body.  Surely it has to be admitted that no provision of the Constitution specifically gives such blanket power to courts to exercise such a supervisory veto over the wisdom and value of legislative policies and to hold unconstitutional those laws which they believe unwise or dangerous.  I readily admit that no legislative body, state or national, should pass laws that can justly be given any \n[p513]\n of the invidious labels invoked as constitutional excuses to strike down state laws.  But perhaps it is not too much to say that no legislative body ever does pass laws without believing that they will accomplish a sane, rational, wise and justifiable purpose.  While I completely subscribe to the holding of Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, and subsequent cases, that our Court has constitutional power to strike down statutes, state or federal, that violate commands of the Federal Constitution, I do not believe that we are granted power by the Due Process Clause or any other constitutional provision or provisions to measure constitutionality by our belief that legislation is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, or accomplishes no justifiable purpose, or is offensive to our own notions of \"civilized standards of conduct.\"\n\n [n5]\n\n  Such an appraisal of the wisdom of legislation is an attribute of the power to make laws, not of the power to interpret them.  The use by federal courts of such a formula or doctrine or whatnot to veto federal or state laws simply takes away from Congress and States the power to make laws based on their own judgment of fairness and wisdom, and transfers that power to this Court for ultimate determination -- a power which was specifically denied to federal courts by the convention that framed the Constitution.\n\n [n6]\n\n\n\n[p514]\n\n", "meta": {"id": 79, "doc_type": null, "date": null, "source_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/381/479"}}

Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, and Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, were both decided in opinions by Mr. Justice McReynolds which elaborated the same natural law due process philosophy found in Lochner v. New York, supra, one of the cases on which he relied in Meyer, along with such other long-discrSyllabus & Opinions Onlys as, e.g., Adams v. Tanner, 244 U.S. 590, and Adkins v. Children's Hospital, supra.\nMeyer held unconstitutional, as an \"arbitrary\" and unreasonable interference with the right of a teacher to carry on his occupation and of parents to hire him, a \n[p516]\n state law forbidding the teaching of modern foreign languages to young children in the schools.\n\n [n7]\n\n  And in Pierce, relying principally on Meyer, Mr. Justice McReynolds said that a state law requiring that all children attend public schools interfered unconstitutionally with the property rights of private school corporations because it was an \"arbitrary, unreasonable and unlawful interference\" which threatened \"destruction of their business and property.\"  268 U.S. at 536.  Without expressing an opinion as to whether either of those cases reached a correct result in light of our later decisions applying the First Amendment to the States through the Fourteenth,\n\n [n8]\n\n I merely point out that the reasoning stated in Meyer and Pierce was the same natural law due process philosophy which many later opinions repudiated, and which I cannot accept.

Our Court certainly has no machinery with which to take a Gallup Poll.\n\n [n13]\n\n  And the scientific miracles of this age have not yet produced a gadget which the Court can use to determine what traditions are rooted in the \"[collective] conscience of our people.\"  Moreover, one would certainly have to look far beyond the language of the Ninth Amendment\n\n [n14]\n\n to find that the Framers vested in this Court any such awesome veto powers over lawmaking, either by the States or by the Congress.  Nor does anything in the history of the Amendment offer any support for such a shocking doctrine.  The whole history of the adoption of the Constitution and Bill of Rights points the other way, and the very material quoted by my Brother GOLDBERG shows that the Ninth Amendment was intended to protect against the idea that, \"by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power\" to the Federal Government, \"those rights which were not singled out were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government [the United States], and were consequently \n[p520]\n insecure.\"\n\n [n15]\n\n  That Amendment was passed not to broaden the powers of this Court or any other department of \"the General Government,\" but, as every student of history knows, to assure the people that the Constitution in all its provisions was intended to limit the Federal Government to the powers granted expressly or by necessary implication.  If any broad, unlimited power to hold laws unconstitutional because they offend what this Court conceives to be the \"[collective] conscience of our people\" is vested in this Court by the Ninth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, or any other provision of the Constitution, it was not given by the Framers, but rather has been bestowed on the Court by the Court.  This fact is perhaps responsible for the peculiar phenomenon that, for a period of a century and a half, no serious suggestion was ever made that the Ninth Amendment, enacted to protect state powers against federal invasion, could be used as a weapon of federal power to prevent state legislatures from passing laws they consider appropriate to govern local affairs.

{"matches": [], "text": "Since 1879, Connecticut has had on its books a law which forbids the use of contraceptives by anyone.  I think this is an uncommonly silly law.  As a practical matter, the law is obviously unenforceable, except in the oblique context of the present case.  As a philosophical matter, I believe the use of contraceptives in the relationship of marriage should be left to personal and private choice, based upon each individual's moral, ethical, and religious beliefs.  As a matter of social policy, I think professional counsel about methods of birth control should be available to all, so that each individual's choice can be meaningfully made.  But we are not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine.  We are asked to hold that it violates the United States Constitution.
