The Act was intended to encourage the development of HMOs as a new form of health care delivery system, see S.\u00a0Rep. No. 93\u0097129, pp.\u00a07\u00979 (1973), and when Congress set the standards that the new health delivery organizations would have to meet to get certain federal benefits, the terms included requirements that the organizations bear and manage risk.  See, e.g., Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, \u00a71301(c), 87 Stat. 916, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300e(c) (1994 ed.); S.\u00a0Rep.

The Senate Committee Report explained that federally qualified HMOs would be required to provide \u0093a basic package of benefits, consistent with existing health insurance patterns,\u0094 id., at 10, and the very text of the Act assumed that state insurance laws would apply to HMOs; it provided that to the extent state insurance capitalization and reserve requirements were too stringent to permit the formation of HMOs, \u0093qualified\u0094 HMOs would be exempt from such limiting regulation.  See \u00a71311, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300e\u009710.  This congressional understanding that it was promoting a novel form of insurance was made explicit in the Senate Report\u0092s reference to the practices of \u0093health insurers to charge premium rates based upon the actual claims experience of a particular group of subscribers,\u0094 thus \u0093raising costs and diminishing the availability of health insurance for those suffering from costly illnesses,\u0094 S.\u00a0Rep. No. 93\u0097129, at 29\u009730.  The federal Act responded to this insurance practice by requiring qualifying HMOs to adopt uniform capitation rates, see \u00a71301(b), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300e(b), and it was because of that mandate \u0093pos[ing] substantial competitive problems to newly emerging HMOs,\u0094 S.\u00a0Rep.

In other words, one year before it passed ERISA, Congress itself defined HMOs in part by reference to risk, set minimum standards for managing the risk, showed awareness that States regulated HMOs as insurers, and compared HMOs to \u0093indemnity or service benefits insurance plans.\u0094"}, {"matches": [], "meta": {"id": 25, "date": "June 20, 2002", "source_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-1021.ZO.html", "doc_type": "opinion"}, "text": "\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This conception has not changed in the intervening years.  Since passage of the federal Act, States have been adopting their own HMO enabling Acts, and today, at least 40 of them, including Illinois, regulate HMOs primarily through the States\u0092 insurance departments, see Aspen Health Law and Compliance Center, Managed Care Law Manual 31\u009732 (Supp. 6, Nov. 1997), although they may be treated differently from traditional insurers, owing to their additional role as health care providers,5 see, e.g., Alaska Ins. Code \u00a721.86.010 (2000) (health department reviews HMO before insurance commissioner grants a certificate of authority); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a71742.21 (West 1994) (health department may inspect HMO).  Finally, this view shared by Congress and the States has passed into common understanding.  HMOs (broadly defined) have \u0093grown explosively in the past decade and [are] now the dominant form of health plan coverage for privately insured individuals.\u0094  Gold & Hurley, The Role of Managed Care \u0093Products\u0094 in Managed Care \u0093Plans,\u0094 in Contemporary Managed Care 47 (M. Gold ed. 1998).  While the original form of the HMO was a single corporation employing its own physicians, the 1980s saw a variety of other types of structures develop even as traditional insurers altered their own plans by adopting HMO-like cost-control measures.  See Weiner & de Lissovoy, Razing a Tower of Babel: A Taxonomy for Managed Care and Health Insurance Plans, 18 J. of Health Politics, Policy and Law 75, 83 (Spring 1993).  The dominant feature is the combination of insurer and provider, see Gold & Hurley, supra, at 47, and \u0093an observer may be hard pressed to uncover the differences among products that bill themselves as HMOs, [preferred provider organizations], or managed care overlays to health insurance.\u0094  Managed Care Law Manual, supra, at 1.  Thus, virtually all commentators on the American health care system describe HMOs as a combination of insurer and provider, and observe that in recent years, traditional \u0093indemnity\u0094 insurance has fallen out of favor.  See, e.g., Weiner & de Lissovoy, supra, at 77 (\u0093A common characteristic of the new managed care plans was the degree to which the roles of insurer and provider became integrated\u0094); Gold, Understanding the Roots: Health Maintenance Organizations in Historical Context, in Contemporary Managed Care, supra, at 7, 8, 13; Managed Care Law Manual, supra, at 1; R.

Illinois has chosen to regulate insurance as one way to regulate the practice of medicine, which we have previously held to be permissible under ERISA, see Metropolitan Life 471 U.S., at 741.  While the statute designed to do this undeniably eliminates whatever may have remained of a plan sponsor\u0092s option to minimize scrutiny of benefit denials, this effect of eliminating an insurer\u0092s autonomy to guarantee terms congenial to its own interests is the stuff of garden variety insurance regulation through the imposition of standard policy terms.  See id., at 742 (\u0093[S]tate laws regulating the substantive terms of insurance contracts were commonplace well before the mid-70\u0092s\u0094).  It is therefore hard to imagine a reservation of state power to regulate insurance that would not be meant to cover restrictions of the insurer\u0092s advantage in this kind of way.  And any lingering doubt about the reasonableness of \u00a74\u009710 in affecting the application of \u00a71132(a) may be put to rest by recalling that regulating insurance tied to what is medically necessary is probably inseparable from enforcing the quintessentially state-law standards of reasonable medical care.

Section 4\u009710 does not, in any event, purport to extend a new substantive benefit.

In UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v.

First, the uniform construction of the statute that has prevailed throughout the country for decades should remain the law unless and until Congress decides to amend the statute.  See Reves v. Ernst & Young, 494 U.S. 56, 74 (1990) (Stevens, J., concurring); Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co. v. Schwalb, 493 U.S. 40, 51 (1989) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); McNally v.

McMahon, 482 U.S. 220, 268\u0097269 (1987) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Second, both this Court and all other federal courts have consistently identified the Hobbs Act as a statute that Congress intended to be given a broad construction. \u00a0See, e.g., Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212 (1960); United States v. Staszcuk, 517 F.2d 53 (CA7 1975).  Third, given the fact that Congress has enacted specific legislation responsive to the concerns that gave rise to these cases,3 the principal beneficiaries of the Court\u0092s dramatic retreat from the position that federal prosecutors and federal courts have maintained throughout the history of this important statute will certainly be the class of professional criminals whose conduct persuaded Congress that the public needed federal protection from extortion.4"}, {"matches": [], "meta": {"id": 41, "date": "February 26, 2003*", "source_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/01-1118.ZD.html", "doc_type": "dissent"}, "text": "\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.

Cain, 533 U.S. 656, 669\u0097670 (2001) (O\u0092Connor, J., concurring) (construing successive application provisions of AEDPA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A)); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412\u0097413 (2000) (construing \u00a72254(d)).  Thus, in addition to performing any analysis required by AEDPA, a federal court considering a habeas petition must conduct a threshold Teague analysis when the issue is properly raised by the state."}, {"matches": [], "meta": {"id": 14, "date": "June 17, 2002", "source_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/01-1385.ZPC.html", "doc_type": "percuriam"}, "text": "\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We reverse the Court of Appeals\u0092 holding that \u0093Teague is not implicated\u0094 by this case, 271 F.3d, at 543, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision."}, {"matches": [], "meta": {"id": 15, "date": "June 17, 2002", "source_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/01-1385.ZPC.html", "doc_type": "percuriam"}, "text": "\nIt is so ordered."}, {"matches": [], "meta": {"id": 16, "date": "June 17, 2002", "source_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/01-1385.ZPC.html", "doc_type": "percuriam"}, "text": "1. \u00a0Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) was modified by AEDPA and now provides, in part, that \u0093[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim \u0085 resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u0094 "}, {"matches": [], "meta": {"id": 17, "date": "June 17, 2002", "source_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/01-1385.ZPC.html", "doc_type": "percuriam"}, "text": "2. \u00a0We also grant respondent\u0092s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis.
