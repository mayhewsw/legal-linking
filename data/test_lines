The California Reproductive Freedom , Accountability , Comprehensive Care , and Transparency Act ( FACT Act ) was enacted to regulate crisis pregnancy centers — pro - life centers that offer pregnancy - related services . The FACT Act requires clinics that primarily serve pregnant women to provide certain notices . Clinics that are licensed must notify women that California provides free or low - cost services , including abortions , and give them a phone number to call . Its stated purpose is to make sure that state residents know their rights and what health care services are available to them . Unlicensed clinics must notify women that California has not licensed the clinics to provide medical services . Its stated purpose is to ensure that pregnant women know when they are receiving health care from licensed professionals . Petitioners — two crisis pregnancy centers , one licensed and one unlicensed , and an organization of crisis pregnancy centers — filed suit . They alleged that both the licensed and the unlicensed notices abridge the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment . The District Court denied their motion for a preliminary injunction , and the Ninth Circuit affirmed . Holding that petitioners could not show a likelihood of success on the merits , the court concluded that the licensed notice survived a lower level of scrutiny applicable to regulations of “ professional speech , ” and that the unlicensed notice satisfied any level of scrutiny .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9

The California Reproductive Freedom , Accountability , Comprehensive Care , and Transparency Act ( FACT Act ) requires clinics that primarily serve pregnant women to provide certain notices . Cal . Health & Safety Code Ann . § 123470 et seq . ( West 2018 ) . Licensed clinics must notify women that California provides free or low - cost services , including abortions , and give them a phone number to call . Unlicensed clinics must notify women that California has not licensed the clinics to provide medical services . The question in this case is whether these notice requirements violate the First Amendment .

The California State Legislature enacted the FACTAct to regulate crisis pregnancy centers . Crisis pregnancy centers — according to a report commissioned by the California State Assembly , App . 86—are “ pro - life ( largely Christian belief - based ) organizations that offer a limited range of free pregnancy options , counseling , and other services to individuals that visit a center . ” Watters et al . , Pregnancy Resource Centers : Ensuring Access and Accuracy of Information 4 ( 2011 ) . “ [ U]nfortunately , ” the author of the FACT Act stated , “ there are nearly 200 licensed and unlicensed ” crisis pregnancy centers in California . App . 84 . These centers “ aim to discourage and prevent women from seeking abortions . ” Id. , at 85 . The author of the FACT Act observed that crisis pregnancy centers “ are commonly affiliated with , or run by organizations whose stated goal ” is to oppose abortion — including “ the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates , ” one of the petitioners here . Ibid . To address this perceived problem , the FACT Act imposes two notice requirements on facilities that provide pregnancy - related services — one for licensed facilities and one for unlicensed facilities .	@@empty@@	unmatched
1	@@empty@@	unmatched
The first notice requirement applies to “ licensed covered facilit[ies ] . ” Cal . Health & Safety Code Ann . § 123471(a ) . To fall under the definition of “ licensed covered facility , ” a clinic must be a licensed primary care or specialty clinic or qualify as an intermittent clinic under California law . Ibid . ( citing § § 1204 , 1206(h ) ) . A licensed covered facility also must have the “ primary purpose ” of “ providing fam - ily planning or pregnancy - related services . ” § 123471(a ) . And it must satisfy at least two of the following six requirements :	@@empty@@	unmatched
After the Governor of California signed the FACT Act , petitioners — a licensed pregnancy center , an unlicensed pregnancy center , and an organization composed of crisis pregnancy centers — filed this suit . Petitioners alleged that the licensed and unlicensed notices abridge the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment . The District Court denied their motion for a preliminary injunction .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed . National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Harris , 839 F. 3d 823 , 845 ( 2016 ) . After concluding that petitioners’ challenge to the FACT Act was ripe , 1 i d . , at 833 , the Ninth Circuit held that petitioners could not show a likelihood of success on the merits . It concluded that the licensed notice survives the “ lower level of scrutiny ” that applies to regulations of “ professional speech . ” Id. , at 833–842 .

The First Amendment , applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment , prohibits laws that abridge the freedom of speech . When enforcing this prohibition , our precedents distinguish between content - based and content - neutral regulations of speech . Content - based regulations “ target speech based on its communicative content . ” Reed v. Town of Gilbert , 576 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2015 ) ( slip op . , at 6 ) . As a general matter , such laws “ are presumptively unconstitutional and may be justified only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests . ” Ibid . This stringent standard reflects the fundamental principle that governments have “ ‘ no power to restrict expression because of its message , its ideas , its subject matter , or its content.’ ” Ibid . ( quoting Police Dept . of Chicago v. Mosley , 408 U. S. 92 , 95 ( 1972 ) ) .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9

( quoting Police Dept . of Chicago v. Mosley , 408 U. S. 92 , 95 ( 1972 ) ) .	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each state , excluding Indians not taxed . But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof .

The Congress shall have power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article .	56
The licensed notice is a content - based regulation of speech . By compelling individuals to speak a particular message , such notices “ alte[r ] the content of [ their ] speech . ” Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C. , Inc. , 487 U. S. 781 , 795 ( 1988 ) ; accord , Turner Broadcasting System , Inc. v. FCC , 512 U. S. 622 , 642 ( 1994 ) ; Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo , 418 U. S. 241 , 256 ( 1974 ) . Here , for example , licensed clinics must provide a government - drafted script about the availability of state - sponsored services , as well as contact information for how to obtain them . One of those services is abortion — the very practice that petitioners are devoted to opposing . By requiring petitioners to inform women how they can obtain state - subsidized abortions — at the same time petitioners try to dissuade women from choosing that option — the licensed notice plainly “ alters the content ” of petitioners’ speech . Riley , supra , at 795 .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Although the licensed notice is content based , the Ninth Circuit did not apply strict scrutiny because it concluded that the notice regulates “ professional speech . ” 839 F. 3d , at 839 . Some Courts of Appeals have recognized “ professional speech ” as a separate category of speech that is subject to different rules . See , e.g. , King v. Governors of New Jersey , 767 F. 3d 216 , 232 ( CA3 2014 ) ; Pickup v. Brown , 740 F. 3d 1208 , 1227–1229 ( CA9 2014 ) ; Moore - King v. County of Chesterfield , 708 F. 3d 560 , 568–570 ( CA4 2014 ) . These courts define “ professionals ” as individuals who provide personalized services to clients and who are subject to “ a generally applicable licensing and regulatory regime . ” Id. , at 569 ; see also , King , supra , at 232 ; Pickup , supra , at 1230 . “ Professional speech ” is then defined as any speech by these individuals that is based on “ [ their ] expert knowledge and judgment , ” King , supra , at 232 , or that is “ within the confines of [ the ] professional relationship , ” Pickup , supra , at 1228 . So defined , these courts except professional speech from the rule that content - based regulations of speech are subject to strict scru - tiny . See King , supra , at 232 ; Pickup , supra , at 1053–1056 ; Moore - King , supra , at 569 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
But this Court has not recognized “ professional speech ” as a separate category of speech . Speech is not unpro - tected merely because it is uttered by “ professionals . ” This Court has “ been reluctant to mark off new categories of speech for diminished constitutional protection . ” Denver Area Ed . Telecommunications Consortium , Inc. v. FCC , 518 U. S. 727 , 804 ( 1996 ) ( Kennedy , J. , concurring in part , concurring in judgment in part , and dissenting in part ) . And it has been especially reluctant to “ exemp[t ] a category of speech from the normal prohibition on content - based restrictions . ” United States v. Alvarez , 567 U. S. 709 , 722 ( 2012 ) ( plurality opinion ) . This Court ’s precedents do not permit governments to impose content - based restrictions on speech without “ ‘ persuasive evidence . . . of a long ( if heretofore unrecognized ) tradition’ ” to that effect . Ibid . ( quoting Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn . , 564 U. S. 786 , 792 ( 2011 ) ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This Court ’s precedents do not recognize such a tradition for a category called “ professional speech . ” This Court has afforded less protection for professional speech in two circumstances — neither of which turned on the fact that professionals were speaking . First , our precedents have applied more deferential review to some laws that require professionals to disclose factual , noncontroversial information in their “ commercial speech . ” See , e.g. , Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio , 471 U. S. 626 , 651 ( 1985 ) ; Milavetz , Gallop & Milavetz , P. A. v. United States , 559 U. S. 229 , 250 ( 2010 ) ; Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn . , 436 U. S. 447 , 455–456 ( 1978 ) . Second , under our precedents , States may regulate professional conduct , even though that conduct incidentally involves speech . See , e.g. , i d . , at 456 ; Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey , 505 U. S. 833 , 884 ( 1992 ) ( opinion of O’Connor , Kennedy , and Souter , JJ . ) . But neither line of precedents is implicated here .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This Court ’s precedents have applied a lower level of scrutiny to laws that compel disclosures in certain contexts . In Zauderer , for example , this Court upheld a rule requiring lawyers who advertised their services on a contingency - fee basis to disclose that clients might be re - quired to pay some fees and costs . 471 U. S. , at 650–653 . Noting that the disclosure requirement governed only “ commercial advertising ” and required the disclosure of “ purely factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which . . . services will be available , ” the Court explained that such requirements should be upheld unless they are “ unjustified or unduly burdensome . ” Id. , at 651 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Zauderer standard does not apply here . Most obviously , the licensed notice is not limited to “ purely factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which . . . services will be available . ” 471 U. S. , at 651 ; see also Hurley v. Irish - American Gay , Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston , Inc. , 515 U. S. 557 , 573 ( 1995 ) ( explaining that Zauderer does not apply outside of these circumstances ) . The notice in no way relates to the services that licensed clinics provide . Instead , it requires these clinics to disclose information about state - sponsored services — including abortion , anything but an “ uncontroversial ” topic . Accordingly , Zauderer has no application here .	@@empty@@	unmatched
2	@@empty@@	unmatched
In addition to disclosure requirements under Zauderer , this Court has upheld regulations of professional conduct that incidentally burden speech . “ [ T]he First Amendment does not prevent restrictions directed at commerce or conduct from imposing incidental burdens on speech , ” Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc. , 564 U. S. 552 , 567 ( 2011 ) , and professionals are no exception to this rule , see Ohralik , supra , at 456 . Longstanding torts for professional malpractice , for example , “ fall within the traditional purview of state regulation of professional conduct . ” NAACP v. Button , 371 U. S. 415 , 438 ( 1963 ) ; but cf . i d . , at 439 ( “ [ A ] State may not , under the guise of prohibiting professional misconduct , ignore constitutional rights ” ) . While drawing the line between speech and conduct can be difficult , this Court ’s precedents have long drawn it , see , e.g. , Sorrell , supra , at 567 ; Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co. , 336 U. S. 490 , 502 ( 1949 ) , and the line is “ ‘ long familiar to the bar,’ ” United States v. Stevens , 559 U. S. 460 , 468 ( 2010 ) ( quoting Simon & Schuster , Inc. v. Members of N. Y State Crime Victims Bd . , 502 U. S. 105 , 127 ( 1991 ) ( Kennedy , J. , concurring in judgment ) ) .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey , for example , this Court upheld a law requiring physicians to obtain informed consent before they could perform an abortion . 505 U. S. , at 884 ( joint opinion of O’Connor , Kennedy , and Souter , JJ . ) . Pennsylvania law required physicians to inform their patients of “ the nature of the procedure , the health risks of the abortion and childbirth , and the ‘ probable gestational age of the unborn child.’ ” Id. , at 881 . The law also required physicians to inform patients of the availability of printed materials from the State , which provided information about the child and various forms of assistance . Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The joint opinion in Casey rejected a free - speech challenge to this informed - consent requirement . Id. , at 884 . It described the Pennsylvania law as “ a requirement that a doctor give a woman certain information as part of obtaining her consent to an abortion , ” which “ for constitutional purposes , [ was ] no different from a requirement that a doctor give certain specific information about any medical procedure . ” Ibid . The joint opinion explained that the law regulated speech only “ as part of the practice of medicine , subject to reasonable licensing and regulation by the State . ” Ibid . ( emphasis added ) . Indeed , the requirement that a doctor obtain informed consent to perform an operation is “ firmly entrenched in American tort law . ” Cruzan v. Director , Mo. Dept . of Health , 497 U. S. 261 , 269 ( 1990 ) ; see , e.g. , Schloendorff v. Society of N. Y. Hospital , 211 N. Y. 125 , 129–130 , 105 N. E. 92 , 93 ( 1914 ) ( Cardozo , J. ) ( explaining that “ a surgeon who performs an operation without his patient ’s consent commits an assault ” ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The licensed notice at issue here is not an informed - consent requirement or any other regulation of professional conduct . The notice does not facilitate informed consent to a medical procedure . In fact , it is not tied to a procedure at all . It applies to all interactions between a covered facility and its clients , regardless of whether a medical procedure is ever sought , offered , or performed . If a covered facility does provide medical procedures , the notice provides no information about the risks or benefits of those procedures . Tellingly , many facilities that provide the exact same services as covered facilities — such as general practice clinics , see § 123471(a)—are not required to provide the licensed notice . The licensed notice regulates speech as speech .	@@empty@@	unmatched
3	@@empty@@	unmatched
Outside of the two contexts discussed above — disclosures under Zauderer and professional conduct — this Court ’s precedents have long protected the First Amendment rights of professionals . For example , this Court has applied strict scrutiny to content - based laws that regulate the noncommercial speech of lawyers , see Reed , 576 U. S. , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 10 ) ( discussing Button , supra , at 438 ) ; In re Primus , 436 U. S. 412 , 432 ( 1978 ) ; professional fundraisers , see Riley , 487 U. S. , at 798 ; and organizations that provided specialized advice about international law , see Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project , 561 U. S. 1 , 27–28 ( 2010 ) . And the Court emphasized that the lawyer ’s statements in Zauderer would have been “ fully protected ” if they were made in a context other than advertising . 471 U. S. , at 637 , n. 7 . Moreover , this Court has stressed the danger of content - based regulations “ in the fields of medicine and public health , where information can save lives . ” Sorrell , supra , at 566 .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
The dangers associated with content - based regulations of speech are also present in the context of professional speech . As with other kinds of speech , regulating the content of professionals’ speech “ pose[s ] the inherent risk that the Government seeks not to advance a legitimate regulatory goal , but to suppress unpopular ideas or information . ” Turner Broadcasting , 512 U. S. , at 641 . Take medicine , for example . “ Doctors help patients make deeply personal decisions , and their candor is crucial . ” Wollschlaeger v. Governor of Florida , 848 F. 3d 1293 , 1328 ( CA11 2017 ) ( en banc ) ( W. Pryor , J. concurring ) . Throughout history , governments have “ manipulat[ed ] the content of doctor - patient discourse ” to increase state power and suppress minorities :	@@empty@@	unmatched
“ For example , during the Cultural Revolution , Chinese physicians were dispatched to the countryside to convince peasants to use contraception . In the 1930s , the Soviet government expedited completion of a construction project on the Siberian railroad by ordering doctors to both reject requests for medical leave from work and conceal this government order from their patients . In Nazi Germany , the Third Reich systematically violated the separation between state ideology and medical discourse . German physicians were taught that they owed a higher duty to the ‘ health of the Volk’ than to the health of individual patients . Recently , Nicolae Ceausescu ’s strategy to increase the Romanian birth rate included prohibitions against giving advice to patients about the use of birth control devices and disseminating information about the use of condoms as a means of preventing the transmission of AIDS . ” Berg , Toward a First Amendment Theory of Doctor - Patient Discourse and the Right To Receive Unbiased Medical Advice , 74 B. U. L. Rev. 201 , 201–202 ( 1994 ) ( footnotes omitted ) .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
Further , when the government polices the content of professional speech , it can fail to “ ‘ preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail.’ ” McCullen v. Coakley , 573 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ – _ _ _ ( 2014 ) ( slip op . , at 8–9 ) . Professionals might have a host of good - faith disagreements , both with each other and with the government , on many topics in their respective fields . Doctors and nurses might disagree about the ethics of assisted suicide or the benefits of medical marijuana ; lawyers and marriage counselors might disagree about the prudence of prenuptial agreements or the wisdom of divorce ; bankers and accountants might disagree about the amount of money that should be devoted to savings or the benefits of tax reform . “ [ T]he best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market , ” Abrams v. United States , 250 U. S. 616 , 630 ( 1919 ) ( Holmes , J. , dissenting ) , and the people lose when the government is the one deciding which ideas should prevail .	@@empty@@	unmatched
“ Professional speech ” is also a difficult category to define with precision . See Entertainment Merchants Assn . , 564 U. S. , at 791 . As defined by the courts of appeals , the professional - speech doctrine would cover a wide array of individuals — doctors , lawyers , nurses , physical therapists , truck drivers , bartenders , barbers , and many others . See Smolla , Professional Speech and the First Amendment , 119 W. Va. L. Rev. 67 , 68 ( 2016 ) . One court of appeals has even applied it to fortune tellers . See Moore - King , 708 F. 3d , at 569 . All that is required to make something a “ profession , ” according to these courts , is that it involves personalized services and requires a professional license from the State . But that gives the States unfettered power to reduce a group ’s First Amendment rights by simply imposing a licensing requirement . States can not choose the protection that speech receives under the First Amendment , as that would give them a powerful tool to impose “ invidious discrimination of disfavored subjects . ” Cincinnati v. Discovery Network , Inc. , 507 U. S. 410 , 423–424 , n. 19 ( 1993 ) ; see also Riley , 487 U. S. , at 796 ( “ [ S]tate labels can not be dispositive of [ the ] degree of First Amendment protection ” ( citing Bigelow v. Virginia , 421 U. S. 809 , 826 ( 1975 ) ) .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
C	@@empty@@	unmatched
In sum , neither California nor the Ninth Circuit has identified a persuasive reason for treating professional speech as a unique category that is exempt from ordinary First Amendment principles . We do not foreclose the possibility that some such reason exists . We need not do so because the licensed notice can not survive even intermediate scrutiny . California asserts a single interest to justify the licensed notice : providing low - income women with information about state - sponsored services . Assuming that this is a substantial state interest , the licensed notice is not sufficiently drawn to achieve it .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
If California ’s goal is to educate low - income women about the services it provides , then the licensed notice is “ wildly underinclusive . ” Entertainment Merchants Assn . , supra , at 802 . The notice applies only to clinics that have a “ primary purpose ” of “ providing family planning or pregnancy - related services ” and that provide two of six categories of specific services . § 123471(a ) . Other clinics that have another primary purpose , or that provide only one category of those services , also serve low - income women and could educate them about the State ’s services . According to the legislative record , California has “ nearly 1,000 community clinics”—including “ federally designated community health centers , migrant health centers , rural health centers , and frontier health centers”—that “ serv[e ] more than 5.6 million patients . . . annually through over 17 million patient encounters . ” App . 58 . But most of those clinics are excluded from the licensed notice requirement without explanation . Such “ [ u]nderinclusive - ness raises serious doubts about whether the government is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes , rather than disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint . ” Entertainment Merchants Assn . , 564 U. S. , at 802 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The FACT Act also excludes , without explanation , federal clinics and Family PACT providers from the licensed - notice requirement . California notes that those clinics can enroll women in California ’s programs themselves , but California ’s stated interest is informing women that these services exist in the first place . California has identified no evidence that the exempted clinics are more likely to provide this information than the covered clinics . In fact , the exempted clinics have long been able to enroll women in California ’s programs , but the FACT Act was premised on the notion that “ thousands of women remain unaware of [ them ] . ” Cal . Legis . Serv . , § 1(b ) . If the goal is to maximize women ’s awareness of these programs , then it would seem that California would ensure that the places that can immediately enroll women also provide this information . The FACT Act ’s exemption for these clinics , which serve many women who are pregnant or could become pregnant in the future , demonstrates the disconnect between its stated purpose and its actual scope . Yet “ [ p]recision . . . must be the touchstone ” when it comes to regulations of speech , which “ so closely touc[h ] our most precious freedoms . ” Button , 371 U. S. , at 438 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Further , California could inform low - income women about its services “ without burdening a speaker with unwanted speech . ” Riley , 487 U. S. , at 800 . Most obvi - ously , it could inform the women itself with a public - information campaign . See ibid . ( concluding that a compelled disclosure was unconstitutional because the government could “ itself publish . . . the disclosure ” ) . Califor - nia could even post the information on public property near crisis pregnancy centers . California argues that it has already tried an advertising campaign , and that many women who are eligible for publicly - funded healthcare have not enrolled . But California has identified no evidence to that effect . And regardless , a “ tepid response ” does not prove that an advertising campaign is not a sufficient alternative . United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group , Inc. , 529 U. S. 803 , 816 ( 2000 ) . Here , for example , individuals might not have enrolled in California ’s services because they do not want them , or because California spent insufficient resources on the advertising campaign . Either way , California can not co - opt the licensed facilities to deliver its message for it . “ [ T]he First Amendment does not permit the State to sacrifice speech for efficiency . ” Riley , supra , at 795 ; accord , Arizona Free Enterprise Club ’s Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett , 564 U. S. 721 , 747 ( 2011 ) .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
In short , petitioners are likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge to the licensed notice . Contrary to the suggestion in the dissent , post , at 3–4 ( opinion of Breyer , J. ) , we do not question the legality of health and safety warnings long considered permissible , or purely factual and uncontroversial disclosures about commercial products .	@@empty@@	unmatched

We next address the unlicensed notice . The parties dispute whether the unlicensed notice is subject to deferential review under Zauderer . 3 We need not decide whether the Zauderer standard applies to the unlicensed notice . Even under Zauderer , a disclosure requirement can not be “ unjustified or unduly burdensome . ” 471 U. S. , at 651 . Our precedents require disclosures to remedy a harm that is “ potentially real not purely hypothetical , ” Ibanez v. Florida Dept . of Business and Professional Regulation , Bd . of Accountancy , 512 U. S. 136 , 146 ( 1994 ) , and to extend “ no broader than reasonably necessary , ” In re R. M. J. , 455 U. S. 191 , 203 ( 1982 ) ; accord , Virginia Bd . of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council , Inc. , 425 U. S. 748 , 772 , n. 24 ( 1976 ) ; Bates v. State Bar of Ariz. , 433 U. S. 350 , 384 ( 1977 ) ; cf . Zauderer , 471 U. S. , at 649 ( rejecting “ broad prophylactic rules ” in this area ) . Otherwise , they risk “ chilling ” protected speech . ” Id. , at 651 . Importantly , California has the burden to prove that the unlicensed notice is neither unjustified nor unduly burdensome . See Ibanez , 512 U. S. , at 146 . It has not met its burden .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We need not decide what type of state interest is sufficient to sustain a disclosure requirement like the unlicensed notice . California has not demonstrated any justification for the unlicensed notice that is more than “ purely hypothetical . ” Ibid . The only justification that the California Legislature put forward was ensuring that “ pregnant women in California know when they are getting medical care from licensed professionals . ” 2015 Cal . Legis . Serv . , § 1(e ) . At oral argument , however , California denied that the justification for the FACT Act was that women “ go into [ crisis pregnancy centers ] and they do n’t realize what they are . ” See Tr . of Oral Arg . at 44–45 . Indeed , California points to nothing suggesting that pregnant women do not already know that the covered facilities are staffed by unlicensed medical professionals . The services that trigger the unlicensed notice — such as having “ volunteers who collect health information from clients , ” “ advertis[ing ] . . . pregnancy options counseling , ” and offering over - the - counter “ pregnancy testing , ” § 123471(b)—do not require a medical license . And California already makes it a crime for individuals without a medical license to practice medicine . See Cal . Bus . & Prof . Code Ann . § 2052 . At this preliminary stage of the litigation , we agree that petitioners are likely to prevail on the question whether California has proved a justification for the unlicensed notice . 4	@@empty@@	unmatched
Even if California had presented a nonhypothetical justification for the unlicensed notice , the FACT Act unduly burdens protected speech . The unlicensed notice imposes a government - scripted , speaker - based disclosure requirement that is wholly disconnected from California ’s informational interest . It requires covered facilities to post California ’s precise notice , no matter what the facilities say on site or in their advertisements . And it covers a curiously narrow subset of speakers . While the licensed notice applies to facilities that provide “ family planning ” services and “ contraception or contraceptive methods , ” § 123471(a ) , the California Legislature dropped these triggering conditions for the unlicensed notice . The unlicensed notice applies only to facilities that primarily provide “ pregnancy - related ” services . § 123471(b ) . Thus , a facility that advertises and provides pregnancy tests is covered by the unlicensed notice , but a facility across the street that advertises and provides nonprescription contraceptives is excluded — even though the latter is no less likely to make women think it is licensed . This Court ’s precedents are deeply skeptical of laws that “ distinguis[h ] among different speakers , allowing speech by some but not others . ” Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm’n , 558 U. S. 310 , 340 ( 2010 ) . Speaker - based laws run the risk that “ the State has left unburdened those speakers whose messages are in accord with its own views . ” Sorrell , 564 U. S. , at 580 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The application of the unlicensed notice to advertisements demonstrates just how burdensome it is . The notice applies to all “ print and digital advertising materials ” by an unlicensed covered facility . § 123472(b ) . These materials must include a government - drafted statement that “ [ t]his facility is not licensed as a medical facility by the State of California and has no licensed medical provider who provides or directly supervises the provision of services . ” § 123472(b)(1 ) . An unlicensed facility must call attention to the notice , instead of its own message , by some method such as larger text or contrasting type or color . See § § 123472(b)(2)–(3 ) . This scripted language must be posted in English and as many other languages as California chooses to require . As California conceded at oral argument , a billboard for an unlicensed facility that says “ Choose Life ” would have to surround that two - word statement with a 29-word statement from the government , in as many as 13 different languages . In this way , the unlicensed notice drowns out the facility ’s own message . More likely , the “ detail required ” by the unlicensed notice “ effectively rules out ” the possibility of having such a billboard in the first place . Ibanez , supra , at 146 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
For all these reasons , the unlicensed notice does not satisfy Zauderer , assuming that standard applies . California has offered no justification that the notice plausibly furthers . It targets speakers , not speech , and imposes an unduly burdensome disclosure requirement that will chill their protected speech . Taking all these circumstances together , we conclude that the unlicensed notice is unjustified and unduly burdensome under Zauderer . We express no view on the legality of a similar disclosure requirement that is better supported or less burdensome .	@@empty@@	unmatched

We hold that petitioners are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the FACT Act violates the First Amendment . We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion .

I join the Court ’s opinion in all respects .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This separate writing seeks to underscore that the apparent viewpoint discrimination here is a matter of serious constitutional concern . See ante , at 6 , n. 2 . The Court , in my view , is correct not to reach this question . It was not sufficiently developed , and the rationale for the Court ’s decision today suffices to resolve the case . And had the Court ’s analysis been confined to viewpoint discrimination , some legislators might have inferred that if the law were reenacted with a broader base and broader coverage it then would be upheld .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It does appear that viewpoint discrimination is inherent in the design and structure of this Act . This law is a paradigmatic example of the serious threat presented when government seeks to impose its own message in the place of individual speech , thought , and expression . For here the State requires primarily pro - life pregnancy centers to promote the State ’s own preferred message advertising abortions . This compels individuals to contradict their most deeply held beliefs , beliefs grounded in basic philosophical , ethical , or religious precepts , or all of these . And the history of the Act ’s passage and its underinclusive application suggest a real possibility that these individuals were targeted because of their beliefs .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The California Legislature included in its official history the congratulatory statement that the Act was part of California ’s legacy of “ forward thinking . ” App . 38–39 . But it is not forward thinking to force individuals to “ be an instrument for fostering public adherence to an ideological point of view [ they ] fin[d ] unacceptable . ” Wooley v. Maynard , 430 U. S. 705 , 715 ( 1977 ) . It is forward thinking to begin by reading the First Amendment as ratified in 1791 ; to understand the history of authoritarian government as the Founders then knew it ; to confirm that history since then shows how relentless authoritarian regimes are in their attempts to stifle free speech ; and to carry those lessons onward as we seek to preserve and teach the necessity of freedom of speech for the generations to come . Governments must not be allowed to force persons to express a message contrary to their deepest convictions . Freedom of speech secures freedom of thought and belief . This law imperils those liberties .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
The petitioners ask us to consider whether two sections of a California statute violate the First Amendment . The first section requires licensed medical facilities ( that provide women with assistance involving pregnancy or family planning ) to tell those women where they might obtain help , including financial help , with comprehensive family planning services , prenatal care , and abortion . The second requires unlicensed facilities offering somewhat similar services to make clear that they are unlicensed . In my view both statutory sections are likely constitutional , and I dissent from the Court ’s contrary conclusions .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
The first statutory section applies to licensed medical facilities dealing with pregnancy and which also provide specific services such as prenatal care , contraception counseling , pregnancy diagnosis , or abortion - related services . Cal . Health & Safety Code Ann . § § 123471(a ) , 1204 , 1206(h ) ( West 2018 ) ( covering “ primary care clinics ” that serve low - income women ) ; Cal . Code Regs . , tit . 22 , § 75026 ( 2018 ) ( “ primary care clinics ” are medical facilities that provide “ services for the care and treatment of patients for whom the clinic accepts responsibility ” with the “ direction or supervision ” of each “ service ” undertaken “ by a person licensed , certified or registered to provide such service ” ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched

“ California has public programs that provide immediate free or low - cost access to comprehensive family planning services ( including all FDA - approved methods of contraception ) , prenatal care , and abortion for eligible women .

The petitioners here , a group of covered medical facilities that object to abortion for religious reasons , brought this case seeking an injunction against enforcement of the California Reproductive Freedom , Accountability , Comprehensive Care , and Transparency Act on the ground that it violates the First Amendment on its face . The District Court denied a preliminary injunction , and the Court of Appeals affirmed . The majority now reverses the Court of Appeals on the ground that the petitioners have shown a likelihood of success on the merits , i.e. , that the statute likely violates the petitioners’ free speech rights and is unconstitutional on its face .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
Before turning to the specific law before us , I focus upon the general interpretation of the First Amendment that the majority says it applies . It applies heightened scru - tiny to the Act because the Act , in its view , is “ content based . ” Ante , at 6–7 . “ By compelling individuals to speak a particular message , ” it adds , “ such notices ‘ alte[r ] the content of [ their ] speech.’ ” Ante , at 7 ( quoting Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C. , Inc. , 487 U. S. 781 , 795 ( 1988 ) ) ( alteration in original ) . “ As a general matter , ” the majority concludes , such laws are “ presumptively unconstitutional ” and are subject to “ stringent ” review . Ante , at 6–7 .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
The majority recognizes exceptions to this general rule : It excepts laws that “ require professionals to disclose factual , noncontroversial information in their ‘ commercial speech,’ ” provided that the disclosure “ relates to the services that [ the regulated entities ] provide . ” Ante , at 8–9 . It also excepts laws that “ regulate professional conduct ” and only “ incidentally burden speech . ” Ante , at 9–10 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This constitutional approach threatens to create serious problems . Because much , perhaps most , human behavior takes place through speech and because much , perhaps most , law regulates that speech in terms of its content , the majority ’s approach at the least threatens considerable litigation over the constitutional validity of much , perhaps most , government regulation . Virtually every disclosure law could be considered “ content based , ” for virtually every disclosure law requires individuals “ to speak a particular message . ” See Reed v. Town of Gilbert , 576 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2015 ) ( Breyer , J. , concurring in judgment ) ( slip op . , at 3 ) ( listing regulations that inevitably involve content discrimination , ranging from securities disclosures to signs at petting zoos ) . Thus , the majority ’s view , if taken literally , could radically change prior law , perhaps placing much securities law or consumer protection law at constitutional risk , depending on how broadly its exceptions are interpreted .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Many ordinary disclosure laws would fall outside the majority ’s exceptions for disclosures related to the professional ’s own services or conduct . These include numerous commonly found disclosure requirements relating to the medical profession . See , e.g. , Cal . Veh . Code Ann . § 27363.5 ( West 2014 ) ( requiring hospitals to tell parents about child seat belts ) ; Cal . Health & Safety Code Ann . § 123222.2 ( requiring hospitals to ask incoming patients if they would like the facility to give their family information about patients’ rights and responsibilities ) ; N. C. Gen. Stat . Ann . § 131E–79.2 ( 2017 ) ( requiring hospitals to tell parents of newborns about pertussis disease and the available vaccine ) . These also include numerous disclosure requirements found in other areas . See , e.g. , N. Y. C. Rules & Regs . , tit . 1 , § 27–01 ( 2018 ) ( requiring signs by elevators showing stair locations ) ; San Francisco Dept . of Health , Director ’s Rules & Regs . , Garbage and Refuse ( July 8 , 2010 ) ( requiring property owners to inform tenants about garbage disposal procedures ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The majority , at the end of Part II of its opinion , perhaps recognizing this problem , adds a general disclaimer . It says that it does not “ question the legality of health and safety warnings long considered permissible , or purely factual and uncontroversial disclosures about commercial products . ” Ante , at 16–17 . But this generally phrased disclaimer would seem more likely to invite litigation than to provide needed limitation and clarification . The major - ity , for example , does not explain why the Act here , which is justified in part by health and safety considerations , does not fall within its “ health ” category . Ante , at 14 ; see also Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey , 505 U. S. 833 , 882–884 ( 1992 ) ( joint opinion of O’Connor , Kennedy , and Souter , JJ . ) ( reasoning that disclosures related to fetal development and childbirth are related to the health of a woman seeking an abortion ) . Nor does the majority opinion offer any reasoned basis that might help apply its disclaimer for distinguishing lawful from unlawful disclosures . In the absence of a reasoned explanation of the disclaimer ’s meaning and rationale , the disclaimer is unlikely to withdraw the invitation to litigation that the majority ’s general broad “ content - based ” test issues . That test invites courts around the Nation to apply an unpredictable First Amendment to ordinary social and economic regulation , striking down disclosure laws that judges may disfavor , while upholding others , all without grounding their decisions in reasoned principle .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
Notably , the majority says nothing about limiting its language to the kind of instance where the Court has traditionally found the First Amendment wary of content - based laws , namely , in cases of viewpoint discrimination . “ Content - based laws merit this protection because they present , albeit sometimes in a subtler form , the same dangers as laws that regulate speech based on viewpoint . ” Reed , 576 U. S. , at _ _ _ ( Alito , J. , concurring ) ( slip op . , at 1 ) . Accordingly , “ [ l]imiting speech based on its ‘ topic’ or ‘ subject’ ” can favor “ those who do not want to disturb the status quo . ” Ibid . But the mine run of disclosure requirements do nothing of that sort . They simply alert the public about child seat belt laws , the location of stairways , and the process to have their garbage collected , among other things .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
Precedent does not require a test such as the majority ’s . Rather , in saying the Act is not a longstanding health and safety law , the Court substitutes its own approach — without a defining standard — for an approach that was reasonably clear . Historically , the Court has been wary of claims that regulation of business activity , particularly health - related activity , violates the Constitution . Ever since this Court departed from the approach it set forth in Lochner v. New York , 198 U. S. 45 ( 1905 ) , ordinary economic and social legislation has been thought to raise little constitutional concern . As Justice Brandeis wrote , typically this Court ’s function in such cases “ is only to determine the reasonableness of the Legislature ’s belief in the existence of evils and in the effectiveness of the remedy provided . ” New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann , 285 U. S. 262 , 286–287 ( 1932 ) ( dissenting opinion ) ; see Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla. , Inc. , 348 U. S. 483 , 486–488 ( 1955 ) ( adopting the approach of Justice Brandeis ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court has taken this same respectful approach to economic and social legislation when a First Amendment claim like the claim present here is at issue . See , e.g. , Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio , 471 U. S. 626 , 651 ( 1985 ) ( upholding reasonable disclosure requirements for attorneys ) ; Milavetz , Gallop & Milavetz , P. A. v. United States , 559 U. S. 229 , 252–253 ( 2010 ) ( same ) ; cf . Central Hudson Gas & Elec . Corp. v. Public Serv . Comm’n of N. Y. , 447 U. S. 557 , 563–564 ( 1980 ) ( applying intermediate scrutiny to other restrictions on commercial speech ) ; In re R. M. J. , 455 U. S. 191 , 203 ( 1982 ) ( no First Amendment protection for misleading or deceptive commercial speech ) . But see Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc. , 564 U. S. 552 ( 2011 ) ( striking down regulation of pharmaceutical drug - related information ) .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
Even during the Lochner era , when this Court struck down numerous economic regulations concerning industry , this Court was careful to defer to state legislative judgments concerning the medical profession . The Court took the view that a State may condition the practice of medicine on any number of requirements , and physicians , in exchange for following those reasonable requirements , could receive a license to practice medicine from the State . Medical professionals do not , generally speaking , have a right to use the Constitution as a weapon allowing them rigorously to control the content of those reasonable conditions . See , e.g. , Dent v. West Virginia , 129 U. S. 114 ( 1889 ) ( upholding medical licensing requirements ) ; Hawker v. New York , 170 U. S. 189 ( 1898 ) ( same ) ; Collins v. Texas , 223 U. S. 288 , 297–298 ( 1912 ) ( recognizing the “ right of the State to adopt a policy even upon medical matters concerning which there is difference of opinion and dispute ” ) ; Lambert v. Yellowley , 272 U. S. 581 , 596 ( 1926 ) ( “ [ T]here is no right to practice medicine which is not subordinate to the police power of the States ” ) ; Graves v. Minnesota , 272 U. S. 425 , 429 ( 1926 ) ( statutes “ regulating the practice of medicine ” involve “ very different considerations ” from those applicable to “ trades [ such as ] locomotive engineers and barbers ” ) ; Semler v. Oregon Bd . of Dental Examiners , 294 U. S. 608 , 612 ( 1935 ) ( upholding state regulation of dentistry given the “ vital interest of public health ” ) . In the name of the First Amendment , the majority today treads into territory where the pre - New Deal , as well as the post - New Deal , Court refused to go .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
The Court , in justification , refers to widely accepted First Amendment goals , such as the need to protect the Nation from laws that “ ‘ suppress unpopular ideas or information’ ” or inhibit the “ ‘ marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail.’ ” Ante , at 12–13 ; see New York Times Co. v. Sullivan , 376 U. S. 254 , 269 ( 1964 ) . The concurrence highlights similar First Amendment interests . Ante , at 2 . I , too , value this role that the First Amendment plays — in an appropriate case . But here , the majority enunciates a general test that reaches far beyond the area where this Court has examined laws closely in the service of those goals . And , in suggesting that heightened scrutiny applies to much economic and social legislation , the majority pays those First Amendment goals a serious disservice through dilution . Using the First Amendment to strike down economic and social laws that legislatures long would have thought themselves free to enact will , for the American public , obscure , not clarify , the true value of protecting freedom of speech .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
Still , what about this specific case ? The disclosure at issue here concerns speech related to abortion . It involves health , differing moral values , and differing points of view . Thus , rather than set forth broad , new , First Amendment principles , I believe that we should focus more directly upon precedent more closely related to the case at hand . This Court has more than once considered disclosure laws relating to reproductive health . Though those rules or holdings have changed over time , they should govern our disposition of this case .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
I begin with Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health , Inc. , 462 U. S. 416 ( 1983 ) . In that case the Court considered a city ordinance requiring a doctor to tell a woman contemplating an abortion about the	@@empty@@	unmatched
“ status of her pregnancy , the development of her fetus , the date of possible viability , the physical and emotional complications that may result from an abortion , and the availability of agencies to provide her with assistance and information with respect to birth control , adoption , and childbirth [ , and ] . . . ‘ the particular risks associated with her own pregnancy and the abortion technique to be employed.’ ” Id. , at 442 ( quoting Akron Codified Ordinances § 1870.06(C ) ( 1978 ) ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The ordinance further required a doctor to tell such a woman that “ ‘ the unborn child is a human life from the moment of conception.’ ” Akron , supra , at 444 ( quoting Akron Codified Ordinances § 1870.06(B)(3 ) ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The plaintiffs claimed that this ordinance violated a woman ’s constitutional right to obtain an abortion . And this Court agreed . The Court stated that laws providing for a woman ’s “ informed consent ” to an abortion were normally valid , for they helped to protect a woman ’s health . Akron , 462 U. S. , at 443–444 . Still , the Court held that the law at issue went “ beyond permissible limits ” because “ much of the information required [ was ] designed not to inform the woman ’s consent but rather to persuade her to withhold it altogether . ” Id. , at 444 . In the Court ’s view , the city had placed unreasonable “ ‘ obstacles in the path of the doctor upon whom [ the woman is ] entitled to rely for advice in connection with her decision.’ ” Id. , at 445 ( quoting Whalen v. Roe , 429 U. S. 589 , 604 , n. 33 ( 1977 ) ) ( alteration in original ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Several years later , in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , 476 U. S. 747 ( 1986 ) , the Court considered a Pennsylvania statute that “ prescribe[d ] in detail the method for securing ‘ informed consent’ ” to an abortion . Id. , at 760 . The statute required the doctor to tell the patient about health risks associated with abortion , possibly available benefits for prenatal care , childbirth , and neonatal care , and agencies offering alternatives to abortion . Id. , at 760–761 . In particular it required the doctor to give the patient printed materials that , among other things , said :	@@empty@@	unmatched
“ ‘ “ There are many public and private agencies willing and able to help you to carry your child to term , and to assist you and your child after your child is born , whether you choose to keep your child or place her or him for adoption .

The law requires that your physician or his agent give you the opportunity to call agencies like these before you undergo an abortion . ” ’ ” Id. , at 761 ( quoting 18 Pa. Cons . Stat . § 3208(a)(1 ) ( 1982 ) ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court , as in Akron , held that the statute ’s information requirements violated the Constitution . They were designed “ ‘ not to inform the woman ’s consent but rather to persuade her to withhold it altogether.’ ” Thornburgh , supra , at 762 ( quoting Akron , supra , at 444 ) . In the Court ’s view , insistence on telling the patient about the availability of “ medical assistance benefits ” if she decided against an abortion was a “ poorly disguised elemen[t ] of discouragement for the abortion decision , ” and the law was the “ antithesis of informed consent . ” Thornburgh , supra , at 763–764 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
These cases , however , whatever support they may have given to the majority ’s view , are no longer good law . In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey , 505 U. S. 833 ( 1992 ) , the Court again considered a state law that required doctors to provide information to a woman deciding whether to proceed with an abortion . That law required the doctor to tell the woman about the nature of the abortion procedure , the health risks of abortion and of childbirth , the “ ‘ probable gestational age of the unborn child,’ ” and the availability of printed materials describing the fetus , medical assistance for childbirth , potential child support , and the agencies that would provide adoption services ( or other alternatives to abortion ) . Id. , at 881 ( joint opinion of O’Connor , Kennedy , and Souter , JJ . ) ( quoting 18 Pa. Cons . Stat . § 3205 ( 1990 ) ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This time a joint opinion of the Court , in judging whether the State could impose these informational requirements , asked whether doing so imposed an “ undue burden ” upon women seeking an abortion . Casey , 505 U. S. , at 882–883 . It held that it did not . Ibid . Hence the statute was constitutional . Id. , at 874 . The joint opinion stated that the statutory requirements amounted to “ reasonable measure[s ] to ensure an informed choice , one which might cause the woman to choose childbirth over abortion . ” Id. , at 883 . And , it “ overruled ” portions of the two cases , Akron and Thornburgh , that might indicate the contrary . Id. , at 882 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In respect to overruling the earlier cases , it wrote :	@@empty@@	unmatched
“ To the extent Akron I and Thornburgh find a constitutional violation when the government requires , as it does here , the giving of truthful , nonmisleading information about the nature of the procedure , the attendant health risks and those of childbirth , and the ‘ probable gestational age’ of the fetus , those cases go too far , are inconsistent with Roe ’s acknowledgment of an important interest in potential life , and are overruled . ” Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The joint opinion specifically discussed the First Amendment , the constitutional provision now directly before us . It concluded that the statute did not violate the First Amendment . It wrote :	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
“ All that is left of petitioners’ argument is an asserted First Amendment right of a physician not to provide information about the risks of abortion , and childbirth , in a manner mandated by the State . To be sure , the physician ’s First Amendment rights not to speak are implicated , see Wooley v. Maynard , 430 U. S. 705 ( 1977 ) , but only as part of the practice of medicine , subject to reasonable licensing and regulation by the State , cf . Whalen v. Roe , 429 U. S. 589 , 603 ( 1977 ) . We see no constitutional infirmity in the requirement that the physician provide the information mandated by the State here . ” Casey , 505 U. S. , at 884 .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
Thus , the Court considered the State ’s statutory requirements , including the requirement that the doctor must inform his patient about where she could learn how to have the newborn child adopted ( if carried to term ) and how she could find related financial assistance . Id. , at 881 . To repeat the point , the Court then held that the State ’s requirements did not violate either the Constitution ’s protection of free speech or its protection of a woman ’s right to choose to have an abortion .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Taking Casey as controlling , the law ’s demand for evenhandedness requires a different answer than that perhaps suggested by Akron and Thornburgh . If a State can lawfully require a doctor to tell a woman seeking an abortion about adoption services , why should it not be able , as here , to require a medical counselor to tell a woman seeking prenatal care or other reproductive healthcare about childbirth and abortion services ? As the question suggests , there is no convincing reason to distinguish between information about adoption and information about abortion in this context . After all , the rule of law embodies evenhandedness , and “ what is sauce for the goose is normally sauce for the gander . ” Heffernan v. City of Paterson , 578 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2016 ) ( slip op . , at 6 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The majority tries to distinguish Casey as concerning a regulation of professional conduct that only incidentally burdened speech . Ante , at 10–11 . Casey , in its view , applies only when obtaining “ informed consent ” to a medical procedure is directly at issue .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This distinction , however , lacks moral , practical , and legal force . The individuals at issue here are all medical personnel engaging in activities that directly affect a woman ’s health — not significantly different from the doctors at issue in Casey . After all , the statute here applies only to “ primary care clinics , ” which provide “ services for the care and treatment of patients for whom the clinic accepts responsibility . ” Cal . Code Regs . , tit . 22 , § 75026(a ) ; see Cal . Health & Safety Code Ann . § § 123471(a ) , 1204 , 1206(h ) . And the persons responsible for patients at those clinics are all persons “ licensed , certified or registered to provide ” pregnancy - related medical services . Cal . Code Regs . , tit . 22 , § 75026(c ) . The petitioners have not , either here or in the District Court , provided any example of a covered clinic that is not operated by licensed doctors or what the statute specifies are equivalent professionals . See , e.g. , App . to Pet . for Cert . 92a ( identifying two obstetrician / gynecologists , a radiologist , an anesthesiologist , a certified nurse midwife , a nurse practitioner , 10 nurses , and two registered diagnostic medical sonographers on staff ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Act requires these medical professionals to disclose information about the possibility of abortion ( including potential financial help ) that is as likely helpful to granting “ informed consent ” as is information about the possibility of adoption and childbirth ( including potential financial help ) . That is why I find it impossible to drive any meaningful legal wedge between the law , as interpreted in Casey , and the law as it should be applied in this case . If the law in Casey regulated speech “ only ‘ as part of the practice of medicine,’ ” ante , at 11 ( quoting Casey , supra , at 884 ) , so too here .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The majority contends that the disclosure here is unrelated to a “ medical procedure , ” unlike that in Casey , and so the State has no reason to inform a woman about alternatives to childbirth ( or , presumably , the health risks of childbirth ) . Ante , at 11 . Really ? No one doubts that choosing an abortion is a medical procedure that involves certain health risks . See Whole Woman ’s Health v. Hellerstedt , 579 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2016 ) ( slip op . , at 30 ) ( identifying the mortality rate in Texas as 1 in 120,000 to 144,000 abortions ) . But the same is true of carrying a child to term and giving birth . That is why prenatal care often involves testing for anemia , infections , measles , chicken pox , genetic disorders , diabetes , pneumonia , urinary tract infections , preeclampsia , and hosts of other medical conditions . Childbirth itself , directly or through pain management , risks harms of various kinds , some connected with caesarean or surgery - related deliveries , some related to more ordinary methods of delivery . Indeed , nationwide “ childbirth is 14 times more likely than abortion to result in ” the woman ’s death . Ibid . Health considerations do not favor disclosure of alternatives and risks associated with the latter but not those associated with the former .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In any case , informed consent principles apply more broadly than only to discrete “ medical procedures . ” Prescription drug labels warn patients of risks even though taking prescription drugs may not be considered a “ medical procedure . ” 21 CFR § 201.56 ( 2017 ) . In California , clinics that screen for breast cancer must post a sign in their offices notifying patients that , if they are diagnosed with breast cancer , their doctor must provide “ a written summary of alternative efficacious methods of treatment , ” a notification that does not relate to the screening procedure at issue . Cal . Health & Safety Code Ann . § 109277 . If even these disclosures fall outside the majority ’s cramped view of Casey and informed consent , it undoubtedly would invalidate the many other disclosures that are routine in the medical context as well . Supra , at 3–4 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The majority also finds it “ [ t]ellin[g ] ” that general practice clinics — i.e . , paid clinics — are not required to provide the licensed notice . Ante , at 11 . But the lack - of - information problem that the statute seeks to ameliorate is a problem that the State explains is commonly found among low - income women . See Brief for State Respondents 5–6 . That those with low income might lack the time to become fully informed and that this circumstance might prove disproportionately correlated with income is not intuitively surprising . Nor is it surprising that those with low income , whatever they choose in respect to pregnancy , might find information about financial assistance particularly useful . There is “ nothing inherently suspect ” about this distinction , McCullen v. Coakley , 573 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2014 ) ( slip op . , at 15 ) , which is not “ based on the content of [ the advocacy ] each group offers , ” Turner Broadcasting System , Inc. v. FCC , 512 U. S. 622 , 658–659 ( 1994 ) , but upon the patients the group generally serves and the needs of that population .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Separately , finding no First Amendment infirmity in the licensed notice is consistent with earlier Court rulings . For instance , in Zauderer we upheld a requirement that attorneys disclose in their advertisements that clients might be liable for significant litigation costs even if their lawsuits were unsuccessful . 471 U. S. , at 650 . We refused to apply heightened scrutiny , instead asking whether the disclosure requirements were “ reasonably related to the State ’s interest in preventing deception of consumers . ” Id. , at 651 .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
The majority concludes that Zauderer does not apply because the disclosure “ in no way relates to the services that licensed clinics provide . ” Ante , at 9 . But information about state resources for family planning , prenatal care , and abortion is related to the services that licensed clinics provide . These clinics provide counseling about contraception ( which is a family - planning service ) , ultrasounds or pregnancy testing ( which is prenatal care ) , or abortion . Cal . Health & Safety Code Ann . § 123471(a ) . The required disclosure is related to the clinic ’s services because it provides information about state resources for the very same services . A patient who knows that she can receive free prenatal care from the State may well prefer to forgo the prenatal care offered at one of the clinics here . And for those interested in family planning and abortion services , information about such alternatives is relevant information to patients offered prenatal care , just as Casey considered information about adoption to be relevant to the abortion decision .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Regardless , Zauderer is not so limited . Zauderer turned on the “ material differences between disclosure requirements and outright prohibitions on speech . ” 471 U. S. , at 650 . A disclosure requirement does not prevent speakers “ from conveying information to the public , ” but “ only require[s ] them to provide somewhat more information than they might otherwise be inclined to present . ” Ibid . Where a State ’s requirement to speak “ purely factual and uncontroversial information ” does not attempt “ to ‘ prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics , nationalism , religion , or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein,’ ” it does not warrant heightened scrutiny . Id. , at 651 ( quoting West Virginia Bd . of Ed . v. Barnette , 319 U. S. 624 , 642 ( 1943 ) ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In Zauderer , the Court emphasized the reason that the First Amendment protects commercial speech at all : “ the value to consumers of the information such speech provides . ” 471 U. S. , at 651 . For that reason , a professional ’s “ constitutionally protected interest in not providing any particular factual information in his advertising is minimal . ” Ibid . But this rationale is not in any way tied to advertisements about a professional ’s own services . For instance , it applies equally to a law that requires doctors , when discharging a child under eight years of age , to “ provide to and discuss with the parents . . . information on the current law requiring child passenger restraint systems , safety belts , and the transportation of children in rear seats . ” Cal . Veh . Code Ann . § 27363.5(a ) . Even though child seat belt laws do not directly relate to the doctor ’s own services , telling parents about such laws does nothing to undermine the flow of factual information . Whether the context is advertising the professional ’s own services or other commercial speech , a doctor ’s First Amendment interest in not providing factual information to patients is the same : minimal , because his professional speech is protected precisely because of its informational value to patients . There is no reason to subject such laws to heightened scrutiny .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
Accordingly , the majority ’s reliance on cases that prohibit rather than require speech is misplaced . Ante , at 12–14 . I agree that “ ‘ in the fields of medicine and public heath , . . . information can save lives,’ ” but the licensed disclosure serves that informational interest by requiring clinics to notify patients of the availability of state resources for family planning services , prenatal care , and abortion , which — unlike the majority ’s examples of normative statements , ante , at 13—is truthful and nonmisleading information . Abortion is a controversial topic and a source of normative debate , but the availability of state resources is not a normative statement or a fact of debat - able truth . The disclosure includes information about resources available should a woman seek to continue her pregnancy or terminate it , and it expresses no official preference for one choice over the other . Similarly , the majority highlights an interest that often underlies our decisions in respect to speech prohibitions — the marketplace of ideas . But that marketplace is fostered , not hindered , by providing information to patients to enable them to make fully informed medical decisions in respect to their pregnancies .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Of course , one might take the majority ’s decision to mean that speech about abortion is special , that it involves in this case not only professional medical matters , but also views based on deeply held religious and moral beliefs about the nature of the practice . To that extent , arguably , the speech here is different from that at issue in Zauderer . But assuming that is so , the law ’s insistence upon treating like cases alike should lead us to reject the petitioners’ arguments that I have discussed . This insistence , the need for evenhandedness , should prove particularly weighty in a case involving abortion rights . That is because Americans hold strong , and differing , views about the matter . Some Americans believe that abortion involves the death of a live and innocent human being . Others believe that the ability to choose an abortion is “ central to personal dignity and autonomy , ” Casey , 505 U. S. , at 851 , and note that the failure to allow women to choose an abortion involves the deaths of innocent women . We have previously noted that we can not try to adjudicate who is right and who is wrong in this moral debate . But we can do our best to interpret American constitutional law so that it applies fairly within a Nation whose citizens strongly hold these different points of view . That is one reason why it is particularly important to interpret the First Amendment so that it applies evenhandedly as between those who disagree so strongly . For this reason too a Constitution that allows States to insist that medical providers tell women about the possibility of adoption should also allow States similarly to insist that medical providers tell women about the possibility of abortion .

It is particularly unfortunate that the majority , through application of so broad and obscure a standard , see supra , at 2–7 , declines to reach remaining arguments that the Act discriminates on the basis of viewpoint . Ante , at 6 , n. 2 . The petitioners argue that it unconstitutionally discriminates on the basis of viewpoint because it primar - ily covers facilities with supporters , organizers , and employees who are likely to hold strong pro - life views . They contend that the statute does not cover facilities likely to hold neutral or pro - choice views , because it exempts facilities that enroll patients in publicly funded programs that include abortion . In doing so , they say , the statute unnecessarily imposes a disproportionate burden upon facilities with pro - life views , the very facilities most likely to find the statute ’s references to abortion morally abhorrent . Brief for Petitioners 31–37 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The problem with this argument lies in the record . Numerous amicus briefs advance the argument . See , e.g. , Brief for Scharpen Foundation , Inc. , et al . as Amici Curiae 6–10 ; Brief for American Center for Law & Justice et al . as Amici Curiae 7–13 . Some add that women who use facilities that are exempt from the statute ’s requirements ( because they enroll patients in two California state - run medical programs that provide abortions ) may still need the information provided by the disclosure , Brief for CATO Institute as Amicus Curiae 15 , a point the majority adopts in concluding that the Act is underinclusive , ante , at 15–16 . But the key question is whether these exempt clinics are significantly more likely than are the pro - life clinics to tell or to have told their pregnant patients about the existence of these programs — in the absence of any statutory compulsion . If so , it may make sense — in terms of the statute ’s informational objective — to exempt them , namely if there is no need to cover them . See FACT Act , § 1(d ) ( suggesting in general terms that this is so ) . But , if there are not good reasons to exempt these clinics from coverage , i.e. , if , for example , they too frequently do not tell their patients about the availability of abortion services , the petitioners’ claim of viewpoint discrimination becomes much stronger .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The petitioners , however , did not develop this point in the record below . They simply stated in their complaint that the Act exempts “ facilities which provide abortion services , freeing them from the Act ’s disclosure requirements , while leaving pro - life facilities subject to them . ” App . to Pet . for Cert . 104a . And in the District Court they relied solely on the allegations of their complaint , provided no supporting declarations , and contended that discovery was unnecessary . Id. , at 47a , 50a , 68a . The District Court concluded that the reason for the Act ’s exemptions was that those clinics “ provide the entire spectrum of services required of the notice , ” and that absent discovery , “ there is no evidence to suggest the Act burdens only ” pro - life conduct . Id. , at 68a . Similarly , the petitioners pressed the claim in the Court of Appeals . Id. , at 20a–22a . But they did not supplement the record . Consequently , that court reached the same conclusion . Given the absence of evidence in the record before the lower courts , the “ viewpoint discrimination ” claim could not justify the issuance of a preliminary injunction .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The second statutory provision covers pregnancy - related facilities that provide women with certain medical - type services ( such as obstetric ultrasounds or sonograms , pregnancy diagnosis , counseling about pregnancy options , or prenatal care ) , are not licensed as medical facilities by the State , and do not have a licensed medical provider on site . Cal . Health & Safety Code Ann . § 123471(b)(1 ) . The statute says that such a facility must disclose that it is not “ licensed as a medical facility . ” § 123472(b ) . And it must make this disclosure in a posted notice and in advertising . Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The majority does not question that the State ’s interest ( ensuring that “ pregnant women in California know when they are getting medical care from licensed professionals ” ) is the type of informational interest that Zauderer encompasses . Ante , at 5 , 17 . Nor could it . In Riley , 487 U. S. 781 , the Court noted that the First Amendment would permit a requirement for “ professional fundraisers to disclose their professional status”—nearly identical to the unlicensed disclosure at issue here . Id. , at 799 and n. 11 ; see also i d . , at 804 ( Scalia , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) ( noting that this requirement was not aimed at combating deception ) . Such informational interests have long justified regulations in the medical context . See , e.g. , Dent , 129 U. S. , at 122 ( upholding medical licensing requirements that “ tend to secure [ a State ’s citizens ] against the consequences of ignorance and incapacity , as well as of deception and fraud ” ) ; Semler , 294 U. S. , at 611 ( upholding state dentistry regulation that “ afford[ed ] protection against ignorance , incapacity and imposition ” ) .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
Nevertheless , the majority concludes that the State ’s interest is “ purely hypothetical ” because unlicensed clinics provide innocuous services that do not require a medical license . Ante , at 17–18 . To do so , it applies a searching standard of review based on our precedents that deal with speech restrictions , not disclosures . Ante , at 17 ( citing , e.g. , In re R. M. J. , 455 U. S. , at 203 ; Virginia Bd . of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council , Inc. , 425 U. S. 748 , 772 , n. 24 ( 1976 ) ; Bates v. State Bar of Ariz. , 433 U. S. 350 , 384 ( 1977 ) ; and Zauderer , 471 U. S. , at 649 ( portion of opinion considering speech restrictions , not disclosures ) ) . This approach is incompatible with Zauderer . See Zauderer , supra , at 651 ( upholding attorney disclosure requirements where “ reasonably related to the State ’s interest ” ) ; Milavetz , 559 U. S. , at 250–253 ( same ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
There is no basis for finding the State ’s interest “ hypothetical . ” The legislature heard that information - related delays in qualified healthcare negatively affect women seeking to terminate their pregnancies as well as women carrying their pregnancies to term , with delays in qualified prenatal care causing life - long health problems for infants . Reproductive FACT Act : Hearing on Assembly B. 775 before the Senate Health Committee , 2015 Cal . Leg . Sess . Even without such testimony , it is “ self - evident ” that patients might think they are receiving qualified medical care when they enter facilities that collect health information , perform obstetric ultrasounds or sonograms , diagnose pregnancy , and provide counseling about pregnancy options or other prenatal care . Milavetz , supra , at 251 . The State ’s conclusion to that effect is certainly reasonable .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The majority also suggests that the Act applies too broadly , namely , to all unlicensed facilities “ no matter what the facilities say on site or in their advertisements . ” Ante , at 18 . But the Court has long held that a law is not unreasonable merely because it is overinclusive . For instance , in Semler the Court upheld as reasonable a state law that prohibited licensed dentists from advertising that their skills were superior to those of other dentists . 294 U. S. , at 609 . A dentist complained that he was , in fact , better than other dentists . Id. , at 610 . Yet the Court held that “ [ i]n framing its policy , the legislature was not bound to provide for determinations of the relative proficiency of particular practitioners . ” Id. , at 612 . To the contrary , “ [ t]he legislature was entitled to consider the general effects of the practices which it described , and if these effects were injurious in facilitating unwarranted and misleading claims , to counteract them by a general rule , even though in particular instances there might be no actual deception or misstatement . ” Id. , at 613 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Relatedly , the majority suggests that the Act is suspect because it covers some speakers but not others . Ante , at 18–19 . I agree that a law ’s exemptions can reveal viewpoint discrimination ( although the majority does not reach this point ) . “ ‘ [ A]n exemption from an otherwise permissible regulation of speech may represent a governmental “ attempt to give one side of a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people . ” ’ ” McCullen , 573 U. S. , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 15 ) ( quoting City of Ladue v. Gilleo , 512 U. S. 43 , 51 ( 1994 ) ) . Such speaker - based laws warrant heightened scrutiny “ when they reflect the Government ’s preference for the substance of what the favored speakers have to say ( or aversion to what the disfavored speakers have to say ) . ” Turner Broadcasting System , Inc. , 512 U. S. , at 658 . Accordingly , where a law ’s exemptions “ facilitate speech on only one side of the abortion debate , ” there is a “ clear form of viewpoint discrimination . ” McCullen , supra , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 18 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
There is no cause for such concern here . The Act does not , on its face , distinguish between facilities that favor pro - life and those that favor pro - choice points of view . Nor is there any convincing evidence before us or in the courts below that discrimination was the purpose or the effect of the statute . Notably , California does not single out pregnancy - related facilities for this type of disclosure require - ment . See , e.g. , Cal . Bus . & Prof . Code Ann . § 2053.6 ( West 2012 ) ( unlicensed providers of alternative health services must disclose that “ he or she is not a licensed physician ” and “ the services to be provided are not licensed by the state ” ) . And it is unremarkable that the State excluded the provision of family planning and contraceptive services as triggering conditions . Ante , at 18–19 . After all , the State was seeking to ensure that “ pregnant women in California know when they are getting medical care from licensed professionals , ” and pregnant women generally do not need contraceptive services .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Finally , the majority concludes that the Act is overly burdensome . Ante , at 19 . I agree that “ unduly burdensome disclosure requirements might offend the First Amendment . ” Zauderer , 471 U. S. , at 651 . But these and similar claims are claims that the statute could be applied unconstitutionally , not that it is unconstitutional on its face . Compare New York State Club Assn . , Inc. v. City of New York , 487 U. S. 1 , 14 ( 1988 ) ( a facial overbreadth challenge must show “ from actual fact ” that a “ substantial number of instances exist in which the Law can not be applied constitutionally ” ) , with Chicago v. Morales , 527 U. S. 41 , 74 ( 1999 ) ( Scalia , J. , dissenting ) ( an as - applied challenge asks whether “ the statute is unconstitutional as applied to this party , in the circumstances of this case ” ) . And it will be open to the petitioners to make these claims if and when the State threatens to enforce the statute in this way . But facial relief is inappropriate here , where the petitioners “ fail ” even “ to describe [ these ] instances of arguable overbreadth of the contested law , ” Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party , 552 U. S. 442 , 449–450 , n. 6 ( 2008 ) , where “ [ n]o record was made in this respect , ” and where the petitioners thus have not shown “ from actual fact ” that a “ substantial number of instances exist in which the Law can not be applied constitutionally , ” New York State Club Assn . , supra , at 14 .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
For instance , the majority highlights that the statute requires facilities to write their “ medical license ” disclaimers in 13 languages . Ante , at 19 . As I understand the Act , it would require disclosure in no more than two languages — English and Spanish — in the vast majority of California ’s 58 counties . The exception is Los Angeles County , where , given the large number of different - language speaking groups , expression in many languages may prove necessary to communicate the message to those whom that message will help . Whether the requirement of 13 different languages goes too far and is unnecessarily burdensome in light of the need to secure the statutory objectives is a matter that concerns Los Angeles County alone , and it is a proper subject for a Los Angeles - based as applied challenge in light of whatever facts a plaintiff finds relevant . At most , such facts might show a need for fewer languages , not invalidation of the statute .	@@empty@@	unmatched

This is a complaint brought by the plaintiff in error to quiet his title to alleged water rights on Tarryall creek , a tributary of the South Platte river , and to enjoin the defendant Irrigation Company and the state officials from closing the plaintiff 's ditch under an assertion of the Irrigation Company 's superior right . The defendants justified under a decree establishing the Irrigation Company 's priority and a statute making the decree conclusive after four years . The plaintiff replied and argued that the statutes , if construed to have the alleged effect , took his property without due process of law , contrary to the 14th Amendment . The defendants demurred and the state courts upheld the defense . 56 Colo. 545 , 139 Pac . 536 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The case is this : In 1879 the state established water districts , the plaintiff 's water rights being in district 23 and the defendant 's in district 8 , directly below 23 , upon the South Platte . Jurisdiction was conferred upon the district courts for the proper county to adjudicate all questions concerning priority of appropriation and other questions of right between ' owners of ditches drawing water for irrigation purposes from the same stream or its tributaries within the same water district . ' Laws of 1879 , Feb. 19 , § 19 , p. 99 . Rev. Stat . 1908 , § 3276 . The provisions were enlarged by an Act of February 23 , 1881 , p. 142 , but still seemingly confined to controversies between parties in the same district , until they came to the sections of limitation . By § 34 the act was not to prevent suits within four years , and by § 35 after ' four years from the time of rendering a final decree , in any water district , all parties whose interests are thereby affected shall be deemed and held to have acquiesced in the same . . . and thereafter all persons shall be forever barred from setting up any claim to priority of rights to water for irrigation in such water district adverse or contrary to the effect of such decree . ' Laws of 1881 , pp . 159 , 160 . Rev. Stat . 1908 , § § 3313 , 3314 . Later statutes were enacted in 1887 and 1903 , creating divisions , and requiring the irrigation division engineers to tabulate the priorities and rights as established by decree in the different districts of their divisions , and to administer the use of water accordingly . But these statutes are not material . The parties ' rights were held to be fixed under the Act of 1881 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On December 10 , 1883 , the proper court for the defendant company 's district made a decree that the company was entitled to a priority of right to the use of water for irrigation purposes of 1184 cubic feet of water per second from the South Platte and its tributaries , dated January 18 , 1879 , which was prior to the date of the plaintiff 's rights . It will be observed that the Act of 1881 was in force when this decree was made . The plaintiff contends that the construction of § 35 of the act , as applying to parties in a different district , this construction having been first announced after the period of limitation had gone by , had the effect of a new statute declaring his rights barred by time already elapsed , and attempted to make conclusive against him a proceeding to which he was not a party and in which he would not have been heard .	@@empty@@	unmatched
So far as the last objection goes the answer is that if it be true that the plaintiff was not entitled to be heard on the defendant 's decree , still there was nothing to hinder the state from providing that , if he took no step to assert his rights within a reasonable time after the judicial assertion of an adverse title , the decree being a public fact , he should lose those rights See Barker v. Harvey , 181 U. S. 481 , 45 L. ed . 963 , 21 Sup . Ct . Rep. 690 ; Soper v. Lawrence Bros. Co. 201 U. S. 359 , 367 , 368 , 50 L. ed . 788 , 791 , 26 Sup . Ct . Rep. 473 ; American Land Co. v.

The answer to the first half of the plaintiff 's contention is no less plain . It is that the construction of a statute does not take a party 's property without due process of law simply because it takes him by surprise , and when it is too late for him to act on the construction and save his rights . That is all that the plaintiff has to complain of . There was no different construction of the statute by the court before the limitation had run , that might have lulled him to repose . The only decisions relied upon by the plaintiff as tending to favor him are Nichols v. McIntosh , 19 Colo. 22 , 34 Pac . 278 , and Sterling Irrig . Co. v. Downer , 19 Colo. 595 , 36 Pac . 787 , which were not rendered until 1893 and 1894 , and both of which are consistent with Ft . Lyon Canal Co. v. Arkansas Valley Sugar Beet & Irrig . Land Co. 39 Colo. 332 , 90 Pac . 1023 , establishing the construction followed in this case . It should be added that , however strong the argument for a different interpretation , the one adopted also was strongly supported , so that there can be no pretense that a perverse reading of the law was used as an excuse for giving a retrospective effect to the law of 1903 . The decision was absolutely entitled to respect .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is suggested that the cases cited established a rule of property , and that any departure from it violated the plaintiff 's rights under the 14th Amendment .

Antisubmarine warfare is one of the Navys highest priorities . The Navys fleet faces a significant threat from modern diesel - electric submarines , which are extremely difficult to detect and track because they can operate almost silently . The most effective tool for identifying submerged diesel - electric submarines is active sonar , which emits pulses of sound underwater and then receives the acoustic waves that echo off the target . Active sonar is a complex technology , and sonar operators must undergo extensive training to become proficient in its use .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This case concerns the Navys use of mid - frequency active ( MFA ) sonar during integrated training exercises in the waters off southern California ( SOCAL ) . In these exercises , ships , submarines , and aircraft train together as members of a strike group. Due to the importance of antisubmarine warfare , a strike group may not be certified for deployment until it demonstrates proficiency in the use of active sonar to detect , track , and neutralize enemy submarines .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The SOCAL waters contain at least 37 species of marine mammals . The plaintiffsgroups and individuals devoted to the protection of marine mammals and ocean habitatsassert that MFA sonar causes serious injuries to these animals . The Navy disputes that claim , noting that MFA sonar training in SOCAL waters has been conducted for 40 years without a single documented sonar - related injury to any marine mammal . Plaintiffs sued the Navy , seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that the training exercises violated the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( NEPA ) and other federal laws ; in particular , plaintiffs contend that the Navy should have prepared an environmental impact statement ( EIS ) before conducting the latest round of SOCAL exercises .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The District Court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Navy from using MFA sonar during its training exercises . The Court of Appeals held that this injunction was overbroad and remanded to the District Court for a narrower remedy . The District Court then entered another preliminary injunction , imposing six restrictions on the Navys use of sonar during its SOCAL training exercises . As relevant to this case , the injunction required the Navy to shut down MFA sonar when a marine mammal was spotted within 2,200 yards of a vessel , and to power down sonar by 6 decibels during conditions known as surface ducting.	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Navy then sought relief from the Executive Branch . The Council on Environmental Quality ( CEQ ) authorized the Navy to implement alternative arrangements to NEPA compliance in light of emergency circumstances. The CEQ allowed the Navy to continue its training exercises under voluntary mitigation procedures that the Navy had previously adopted .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Navy moved to vacate the District Courts preliminary injunction in light of the CEQs actions . The District Court refused to do so , and the Court of Appeals affirmed . The Court of Appeals held that there was a serious question whether the CEQs interpretation of the emergency circumstances regulation was lawful , that plaintiffs had carried their burden of establishing a possibility of irreparable injury , and that the preliminary injunction was appropriate because the balance of hardships and consideration of the public interest favored the plaintiffs . The Court of Appeals emphasized that any negative impact of the injunction on the Navys training exercises was speculative, and determined that ( 1 ) the 2,200-yard shutdown zone was unlikely to affect naval operations , because MFA sonar systems are often shut down during training exercises ; and ( 2 ) the power - down requirement during surface ducting conditions was not unreasonable , because such conditions are rare and the Navy has previously certified strike groups not trained under these conditions .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Even if plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable injury , such injury is outweighed by the public interest and the Navys interest in effective , realistic training of its sailors . For the same reason , it is unnecessary to address the lower courts holding that plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on the merits . Pp . 1014 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
( b ) A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right . In each case , courts must balance the competing claims of injury and consider the effect of granting or withholding the requested relief , paying particular regard to the public consequences . Weinberger v. Romero - Barcelo , 456 U. S. 305 . Military interests do not always trump other considerations , and the Court has not held that they do , but courts must give deference to the professional judgment of military authorities concerning the relative importance of a particular military interest . Goldman v. Weinberger , 475 U. S. 503 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Here , the record contains declarations from some of the Navys most senior officers , all of whom underscored the threat posed by enemy submarines and the need for extensive sonar training to counter this threat . Those officers emphasized that realistic training can not be accomplished under the two challenged restrictions imposed by the District Courtthe 2,200-yard shutdown zone and the power - down requirement during surface ducting conditions . The use of MFA sonar under realistic conditions during training exercises is clearly of the utmost importance to the Navy and the Nation . The Court does not question the importance of plaintiffs ecological , scientific , and recreational interests , but it concludes that the balance of equities and consideration of the overall public interest tip strongly in favor of the Navy . The determination of where the public interest lies in this case does not strike the Court as a close question . Pp . 1416 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
( c ) The lower courts justifications for entering the preliminary injunction are not persuasive . Pp . 1621 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
( 1 ) The District Court did not give serious consideration to the balance of equities and the public interest . The Court of Appeals did consider these factors and conclude that the Navys concerns about the preliminary injunction were speculative. But that is almost always the case when a plaintiff seeks injunctive relief to alter a defendants conduct . The lower courts failed properly to defer to senior Navy officers specific , predictive judgments about how the preliminary injunction would reduce the effectiveness of the Navys SOCAL training exercises . Pp . 1617 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
( 2 ) The District Court abused its discretion by requiring the Navy to shut down MFA sonar when a marine mammal is spotted within 2,200 yards of a sonar - emitting vessel . The Court of Appeals concluded that the zone would not be overly burdensome because marine mammal sightings during training exercises are relatively rare . But regardless of the frequency of such sightings , the injunction will increase the radius of the shutdown zone from 200 to 2,200 yards , which expands its surface area by a factor of over 100 . Moreover , because training scenarios can take several days to develop , each additional shutdown can result in the loss of several days worth of training . The Court of Appeals also concluded that the shutdown zone would not be overly burdensome because the Navy had shut down MFA sonar several times during prior exercises when marine mammals were spotted well beyond the Navys self - imposed 200-yard zone . But the court ignored undisputed evidence that these voluntary shutdowns only occurred during tactically insignificant times . Pp . 1820 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
( 3 ) The District Court also abused its discretion by requiring the Navy to power down MFA sonar by 6 decibels during significant surface ducting conditions . When surface ducting occurs , active sonar becomes more useful near the surface , but less effective at greater depths . Diesel - electric submariners are trained to take advantage of these distortions to avoid being detected by sonar . The Court of Appeals concluded that the power - down requirement was reasonable because surface ducting occurs relatively rarely , and the Navy has previously certified strike groups that did not train under such conditions . This reasoning is backwards . Given that surface ducting is both rare and unpredictable , it is especially important for the Navy to be able to train under these conditions when they occur . Pp . 2021 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
( 4 ) The Navy has previously taken voluntary measures to address concerns about marine mammals , and has chosen not to challenge four other restrictions imposed by the District Court in this case . But that hardly means that other , more intrusive restrictions pose no threat to preparedness for war . The Court of Appeals noted that the Navy could return to the District Court to seek modification of the preliminary injunction if it actually resulted in an inability to train . The Navy is not required to wait until it is unable to train sufficient forces for national defense before seeking dissolution of the preliminary injunction . By then it may be too late . P. 21 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
( d ) This Court does not address the underlying merits of plaintiffs claims , but the foregoing analysis makes clear that it would also be an abuse of discretion to enter a permanent injunction along the same lines as the preliminary injunction . Plaintiffs ultimate legal claim is that the Navy must prepare an EIS , not that it must cease sonar training . There is accordingly no basis for enjoining such training pending preparation of an EISif one is determined to be requiredwhen doing so is credibly alleged to pose a serious threat to national security . There are many other remedial tools available , including declaratory relief or an injunction specifically tailored to preparation of an EIS , that do not carry such dire consequences .

To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace. 1 Messages and Papers of the Presidents 57 ( J. Richardson comp . 1897 ) . So said George Washington in his first Annual Address to Congress , 218 years ago . One of the most important ways the Navy prepares for war is through integrated training exercises at sea . These exercises include training in the use of modern sonar to detect and track enemy submarines , something the Navy has done for the past 40 years . The plaintiffs complained that the Navys sonar training program harmed marine mammals , and that the Navy should have prepared an environmental impact statement before commencing its latest round of training exercises . The Court of Appeals upheld a preliminary injunction imposing restrictions on the Navys sonar training , even though that court acknowledged that the record contains no evidence that marine mammals have been harmed by the Navys exercises.518 F. 3d 658 , 696 ( CA9 2008 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched

The Navy deploys its forces in strike groups, which are groups of surface ships , submarines , and aircraft centered around either an aircraft carrier or an amphibious assault ship . App . to Pet . for Cert . ( Pet . App . ) 316a317a . Seamless coordination among strike - group assets is critical . Before deploying a strike group , the Navy requires extensive integrated training in analysis and prioritization of threats , execution of military missions , and maintenance of force protection .

Antisubmarine warfare is currently the Pacific Fleets top war - fighting priority . Pet . App . 270a271a . Modern diesel - electric submarines pose a significant threat to Navy vessels because they can operate almost silently , making them extremely difficult to detect and track . Potential adversaries of the United States possess at least 300 of these submarines . App . 571 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The most effective technology for identifying submerged diesel - electric submarines within their torpedo range is active sonar , which involves emitting pulses of sound underwater and then receiving the acoustic waves that echo off the target . Pet . App . 266a267a , 274a . Active sonar is a particularly useful tool because it provides both the bearing and the distance of target submarines ; it is also sensitive enough to allow the Navy to track enemy submarines that are quieter than the surrounding marine environment . 1 This case concerns the Navys use of mid - frequency active ( MFA ) sonar , which transmits sound waves at frequencies between 1 kHz and 10 kHz .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Not surprisingly , MFA sonar is a complex technology , and sonar operators must undergo extensive training to become proficient in its use . Sonar reception can be affected by countless different factors , including the time of day , water density , salinity , currents , weather conditions , and the contours of the sea floor . Id. , at 278a279a . When working as part of a strike group , sonar operators must be able to coordinate with other Navy ships and planes while avoiding interference . The Navy conducts regular training exercises under realistic conditions to ensure that sonar operators are thoroughly skilled in its use in a variety of situations .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The waters off the coast of southern California ( SOCAL ) are an ideal location for conducting integrated training exercises , as this is the only area on the west coast that is relatively close to land , air , and sea bases , as well as amphibious landing areas . App . 141142.At issue in this case are the Composite Training Unit Exercises and the Joint Tactical Force Exercises , in which individual naval units ( ships , submarines , and aircraft ) train together as members of a strike group . A strike group can not be certified for deployment until it has successfully completed the integrated training exercises , including a demonstration of its ability to operate under simulated hostile conditions . Id. , at 564565.In light of the threat posed by enemy submarines , all strike groups must demonstrate proficiency in antisubmarine warfare . Accordingly , the SOCAL exercises include extensive training in detecting , tracking , and neutralizing enemy submarines . The use of MFA sonar during these exercises is mission - critical, given that MFA sonar is the only proven method of identifying submerged diesel - electric submarines operating on battery power . Id. , at 568571 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Sharing the waters in the SOCAL operating area are at least 37 species of marine mammals , including dolphins , whales , and sea lions . The parties strongly dispute the extent to which the Navys training activities will harm those animals or disrupt their behavioral patterns . The Navy emphasizes that it has used MFA sonar during training exercises in SOCAL for 40 years , without a single documented sonar - related injury to any marine mammal . The Navy asserts that , at most , MFA sonar may cause temporary hearing loss or brief disruptions of marine mammals behavioral patterns .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The plaintiffs are the Natural Resources Defense Council , Jean - Michael Cousteau ( an environmental enthusiast and filmmaker ) , and several other groups devoted to the protection of marine mammals and ocean habitats . They contend that MFA sonar can cause much more serious injuries to marine mammals than the Navy acknowledges , including permanent hearing loss , decompression sickness , and major behavioral disruptions . According to the plaintiffs , several mass strandings of marine mammals ( outside of SOCAL ) have been associated with the use of active sonar . They argue that certain species of marine mammalssuch as beaked whalesare uniquely susceptible to injury from active sonar ; these injuries would not necessarily be detected by the Navy , given that beaked whales are very deep divers that spend little time at the surface .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The procedural history of this case is rather complicated . The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 ( MMPA ) , 86Stat . 1027 , generally prohibits any individual from taking a marine mammal , defined as harassing , hunting , capturing , or killing it . 16 U. S. C. § § 1362(13 ) . The Secretary of Defense may exempt any action or category of actions from the MMPA if such actions are necessary for national defense. § 1371(f)(1 ) . In January 2007 , the Deputy Secretary of Defenseacting for the Secretarygranted the Navy a 2-year exemption from the MMPA for the training exercises at issue in this case . Pet . App . 219a220a . The exemption was conditioned on the Navy adopting several mitigation procedures , including : ( 1 ) training lookouts and officers to watch for marine mammals ; ( 2 ) requiring at least five lookouts with binoculars on each vessel to watch for anomalies on the water surface ( including marine mammals ) ; ( 3 ) requiring aircraft and sonar operators to report detected marine mammals in the vicinity of the training exercises ; ( 4 ) requiring reduction of active sonar transmission levels by 6 dB if a marine mammal is detected within 1,000 yards of the bow of the vessel , or by 10 dB if detected within 500 yards ; ( 5 ) requiring complete shutdown of active sonar transmission if a marine mammal is detected within 200 yards of the vessel ; ( 6 ) requiring active sonar to be operated at the lowest practicable level ; and ( 7 ) adopting coordination and reporting procedures .

The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( NEPA ) , 83Stat . 852 , requires federal agencies to the fullest extent possible to prepare an environmental impact statement ( EIS ) for every . . . major Federal actio[n ] significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. 42 U. S. C. § 4332(2)(C ) ( 2000 ed . ) . An agency is not required to prepare a full EIS if it determinesbased on a shorter environmental assessment ( EA)that the proposed action will not have a significant impact on the environment . 40 CFR § § 1508.9(a ) , 1508.13 ( 2007 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In February 2007 , the Navy issued an EA concluding that the 14 SOCAL training exercises scheduled through January 2009 would not have a significant impact on the environment . App . 226227.The EA divided potential injury to marine mammals into two categories : Level A harassment , defined as the potential destruction or loss of biological tissue ( i.e. , physical injury ) , and Level B harassment , defined as temporary injury or disruption of behavioral patterns such as migration , feeding , surfacing , and breeding .

The Navys computer models predicted that the SOCAL training exercises would cause only eight Level A harassments of common dolphins each year , and that even these injuries could be avoided through the Navys voluntary mitigation measures , given that dolphins travel in large pods easily located by Navy lookouts . Id. , at 176177 , 183 . The EA also predicted 274 Level B harassments of beaked whales per year , none of which would result in permanent injury . Id. , at 185186.Beaked whales spend little time at the surface , so the precise effect of active sonar on these mammals is unclear . Erring on the side of caution , the Navy classified allprojected harassments of beaked whales as Level A. Id. , at 186 , 223 . In light of its conclusion that the SOCAL training exercises would not have a significant impact on the environment , the Navy determined that it was unnecessary to prepare a full EIS . See 40 CFR § 1508.13 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Shortly after the Navy released its EA , the plaintiffs sued the Navy , seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that the Navys SOCAL training exercises violated NEPA , the Endangered Species Act of 1973 ( ESA ) , and the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 ( CZMA ) . 2 The District Court granted plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction and prohibited the Navy from using MFA sonar during its remaining training exercises . The court held that plaintiffs had demonstrated a probability of success on their claims under NEPA and the CZMA . Pet . App . 207a , 215a . The court also determined that equitable relief was appropriate because , under Ninth Circuit precedent , plaintiffs had established at least a  possibility  of irreparable harm to the environment . Id. , at 217a . Based on scientific studies , declarations from experts , and other evidence in the record , the District Court concluded that there was in fact a near certainty of irreparable injury to the environment , and that this injury outweighed any possible harm to the Navy . Id. , at 217a218a .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Navy filed an emergency appeal , and the Ninth Circuit stayed the injunction pending appeal . 502 F. 3d 859 , 865 ( 2007 ) . After hearing oral argument , the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that preliminary injunctive relief was appropriate . The appellate court concluded , however , that a blanket injunction prohibiting the Navy from using MFA sonar in SOCAL was overbroad , and remanded the case to the District Court to narrow its injunction so as to provide mitigation conditions under which the Navy may conduct its training exercises. 508 F. 3d 885 , 887 ( 2007 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On remand , the District Court entered a new preliminary injunction allowing the Navy to use MFA sonar only as long as it implemented the following mitigation measures ( in addition to the measures the Navy had adopted pursuant to its MMPA exemption ) : ( 1 ) imposing a 12-mile exclusion zone from the coastline ; ( 2 ) using lookouts to conduct additional monitoring for marine mammals ; ( 3 ) restricting the use of helicopter - dipping sonar ; ( 4 ) limiting the use of MFA sonar in geographic choke points ; ( 5 ) shutting down MFA sonar when a marine mammal is spotted within 2,200 yards of a vessel ; and ( 6 ) powering down MFA sonar by 6 dB during significant surface ducting conditions , in which sound travels further than it otherwise would due to temperature differences in adjacent layers of water . 530 F. Supp . 2d 1110 , 11181121 ( CD Cal . 2008 ) . The Navy filed a notice of appeal , challenging only the last two restrictions .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Navy then sought relief from the Executive Branch . The President , pursuant to 16 U. S. C. § 1456(c)(1)(B ) , granted the Navy an exemption from the CZMA . Section 1456(c)(1)(B ) permits such exemptions if the activity in question is in the paramount interest of the United States. The President determined that continuation of the exercises as limited by the Navy was essential to national security. Pet . App . 232a . He concluded that compliance with the District Courts injunction would undermine the Navys ability to conduct realistic training exercises that are necessary to ensure the combat effectiveness of . . . strike groups. Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Simultaneously , the Council on Environmental Quality ( CEQ ) authorized the Navy to implement alternative arrangements to NEPA compliance in light of emergency circumstances. See 40 CFR § 1506.11 . 3 The CEQ determined that alternative arrangements were appropriate because the District Courts injunction create[s ] a significant and unreasonable risk that Strike Groups will not be able to train and be certified as fully mission capable. Pet . App . 238a . Under the alternative arrangements , the Navy would be permitted to conduct its training exercises under the mitigation procedures adopted in con - junction with the exemption from the MMPA . The CEQ also imposed additional notice , research , and reporting requirements .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In light of these actions , the Navy then moved to vacate the District Courts injunction with respect to the 2,200-yard shutdown zone and the restrictions on training in surface ducting conditions . The District Court refused to do so , 527 F. Supp . 2d 1216 ( 2008 ) , and the Court of Appeals affirmed . The Ninth Circuit held that there was a serious question regarding whether the CEQs interpretation of the emergency circumstances regulation was lawful . Specifically , the court questioned whether there was a true emergency in this case , given that the Navy has been on notice of its obligation to comply with NEPA from the moment it first planned the SOCAL training exercises . 518 F. 3d , at 681 . The Court of Appeals concluded that the preliminary injunction was entirely predictable in light of the parties litigation history . Ibid . The court also held that plaintiffs had established a likelihood of success on their claim that the Navy was required to prepare a full EIS for the SOCAL training exercises . Id. , at 693.The Ninth Circuit agreed with the District Courts holding that the Navys EAwhich resulted in a finding of no significant environmental impactwas cursory , unsupported by cited evidence , or unconvincing. Ibid . 4	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court of Appeals further determined that plaintiffs had carried their burden of establishing a possibility of irreparable injury . Even under the Navys own figures , the court concluded , the training exercises would cause 564 physical injuries to marine mammals , as well as 170,000 disturbances of marine mammals behavior . Id. , at 696 . Lastly , the Court of Appeals held that the balance of hardships and consideration of the public interest weighed in favor of the plaintiffs . The court emphasized that the negative impact on the Navys training exercises was speculative, since the Navy has never before operated under the procedures required by the District Court . Id. , at 698699 . In particular , the court determined that : ( 1 ) the 2,200-yard shutdown zone imposed by the District Court was unlikely to affect the Navys operations , because the Navy often shuts down its MFA sonar systems during the course of training exercises ; and ( 2 ) the power - down requirement during significant surface ducting conditions was not unreasonable because such conditions are rare , and the Navy has previously certified strike groups that had not trained under such conditions .

A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits , that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief , that the balance of equities tips in his favor , and that an injunction is in the public interest .

The District Court and the Ninth Circuit concluded that plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their NEPA claim . The Navy strongly disputes this determination , arguing that plaintiffs likelihood of success is low because the CEQ reasonably concluded that emergency circumstances justified alternative arrangements to NEPA compliance . 40 CFR § 1506.11 . Plaintiffs briefs before this Court barely discuss the ground relied upon by the lower courtsthat the plain meaning of emergency circumstances does not encompass a court order that was entirely predictable in light of the parties litigation history . 518 F. 3d , at 681 . Instead , plaintiffs contend that the CEQs actions violated the separation of powers by readjudicating a factual issue already decided by an Article III court . Moreover , they assert that the CEQs interpretations of NEPA are not entitled to deference because the CEQ has not been given statutory authority to conduct adjudications .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The District Court and the Ninth Circuit also held that when a plaintiff demonstrates a strong likelihood of prevailing on the merits , a preliminary injunction may be entered based only on a possibility of irreparable harm . Id. , at 696697 ; 530 F. Supp . 2d , at 1118 ( quoting Faith Center Church Evangelistic Ministries v. Glover , 480 F. 3d 891 , 906 ( CA9 2007 ) ; Earth Island Inst . v. United States Forest Serv . , 442 F. 3d 1147 , 1159 ( CA9 2006 ) ) . The lower courts held that plaintiffs had met this standard because the scientific studies , declarations , and other evidence in the record established to a near certainty that the Navys training exercises would cause irreparable harm to the environment . 530 F. Supp . 2d , at 1118 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Navy challenges these holdings , arguing that plaintiffs must demonstrate a likelihood of irreparable injurynot just a possibilityin order to obtain preliminary relief . On the facts of this case , the Navy contends that plaintiffs alleged injuries are too speculative to give rise to irreparable injury , given that ever since the Navys training program began 40 years ago , there has been no documented case of sonar - related injury to marine mammals in SOCAL . And even if MFA sonar does cause a limited number of injuries to individual marine mammals , the Navy asserts that plaintiffs have failed to offer evidence of species - level harm that would adversely affect their scientific , recreational , and ecological interests . For their part , plaintiffs assert that they would prevail under any formulation of the irreparable injury standard , because the District Court found that they had established a near certainty of irreparable harm .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We agree with the Navy that the Ninth Circuits possibility standard is too lenient . Our frequently reiterated standard requires plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief to demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction . Los Angeles v. Lyons , 461 U. S. 95 , 103 ( 1983 ) ; Granny Goose Foods , Inc. v. Teamsters , 415 U. S. 423 , 441 ( 1974 ) ; OShea v. Littleton , 414 U. S. 488 , 502 ( 1974 ) ; see also 11A C. Wright , A. Miller , & M. Kane , Federal Practice and Procedure § 2948.1 , p. 139 ( 2d ed . 1995 ) ( hereinafter Wright & Miller ) ( applicant must demonstrate that in the absence of a preliminary injunction , the applicant is likely to suffer irreparable harm before a decision on the merits can be rendered ) ; i d . , at 155 ( a preliminary injunction will not be issued simply to prevent the possibility of some remote future injury ) . Issuing a preliminary injunction based only on a possibility of irreparable harm is inconsistent with our characterization of injunctive relief as an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief .

It is not clear that articulating the incorrect standard affected the Ninth Circuits analysis of irreparable harm . Although the court referred to the possibility standard , and cited Circuit precedent along the same lines , it affirmed the District Courts conclusion that plaintiffs had established a  near certainty  of irreparable harm . 518 F. 3d , at 696697 . At the same time , however , the nature of the District Courts conclusion is itself unclear . The District Court originally found irreparable harm from sonar - training exercises generally . But by the time of the District Courts final decision , the Navy challenged only two of six restrictions imposed by the court . See supra , at 78 . The District Court did not reconsider the likelihood of irreparable harm in light of the four restrictions not challenged by the Navy . This failure is significant in light of the District Courts own statement that the 12-mile exclusion zone from the coastlineone of the unchallenged mitigation restrictionswould bar the use of MFA sonar in a significant portion of important marine mammal habitat. 530 F. Supp . 2d , at 1119 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We also find it pertinent that this is not a case in which the defendant is conducting a new type of activity with completely unknown effects on the environment . When the Government conducts an activity , NEPA itself does not mandate particular results. Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council , 490 U. S. 332 , 350 ( 1989 ) . Instead , NEPA imposes only procedural requirements to ensur[e ] that the agency , in reaching its decision , will have available , and will carefully consider , detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts. Id. , at 349 . Part of the harm NEPA attempts to prevent in requiring an EIS is that , without one , there may be little if any information about prospective environmental harms and potential mitigating measures . Here , in contrast , the plaintiffs are seeking to enjoinor substantially restricttraining exercises that have been taking place in SOCAL for the last 40 years . And the latest series of exercises were not approved until after the defendant took a hard look at environmental consequences, i d . , at 350 ( quoting Kleppe v. Sierra Club , 427 U. S. 390 , 410 , n. 21 ( 1976 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) , as evidenced by the issuance of a detailed , 293-page EA .	@@empty@@	unmatched
As explained in the next section , even if plaintiffs have shown irreparable injury from the Navys training exercises , any such injury is outweighed by the public interest and the Navys interest in effective , realistic training of its sailors .

Here , the record contains declarations from some of the Navys most senior officers , all of whom underscored the threat posed by enemy submarines and the need for extensive sonar training to counter this threat . Admiral Gary Rougheadthe Chief of Naval Operationsstated that during training exercises :	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is important to stress the ship crews in all dimensions of warfare simultaneously . If one of these training elements were impactedfor example , if effective sonar training were not possiblethe training value of the other elements would also be degraded . . . . Pet . App . 342a .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Captain Martin Maythe Third Fleets Assistant Chief of Staff for Training and Readinessemphasized that the use of MFA sonar is mission - critical. App . 570571.He described the ability to operate MFA sonar as a highly perishable skill that must be repeatedly practiced under realistic conditions . Id. , at 577 . During training exercises , MFA sonar operators learn how to avoid sound - reducing clutter from ocean floor topography and environmental conditions ; they also learn how to avoid interference and how to coordinate their efforts with other sonar operators in the strike group . Id. , at 574 . Several Navy officers emphasized that realistic training can not be accomplished under the two challenged restrictions imposed by the District Courtthe 2,200-yard shutdown zone and the requirement that the Navy power down its sonar systems during significant surface ducting conditions . See , e.g. , Pet . App . 333a ( powering down in presence of surface ducting unreasonably prevent[s ] realistic training ) ; i d . , at 356a ( shutdown zone would result in a significant , adverse impact to realistic training ) . We accept these officers assertions that the use of MFA sonar under realistic conditions during training exercises is of the utmost importance to the Navy and the Nation .	@@empty@@	unmatched
These interests must be weighed against the possible harm to the ecological , scientific , and recreational interests that are legitimately before this Court . Plaintiffs have submitted declarations asserting that they take whale watching trips , observe marine mammals underwater , conduct scientific research on marine mammals , and photograph these animals in their natural habitats . Plaintiffs contend that the Navys use of MFA sonar will injure marine mammals or alter their behavioral patterns , impairing plaintiffs ability to study and observe theanimals .	@@empty@@	unmatched
While we do not question the seriousness of these interests , we conclude that the balance of equities and consideration of the overall public interest in this case tip strongly in favor of the Navy . For the plaintiffs , the most serious possible injury would be harm to an unknown number of the marine mammals that they study and observe . In contrast , forcing the Navy to deploy an inadequately trained antisubmarine force jeopardizes the safety of the fleet . Active sonar is the only reliable technology for detecting and tracking enemy diesel - electric submarines , and the Presidentthe Commander in Chiefhas determined that training with active sonar is essential to national security. Pet . App . 232a .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The public interest in conducting training exercises with active sonar under realistic conditions plainly outweighs the interests advanced by the plaintiffs . Of course , military interests do not always trump other considerations , and we have not held that they do . In this case , however , the proper determination of where the public interest lies does not strike us as a close question .	@@empty@@	unmatched
1.Despite the importance of assessing the balance of equities and the public interest in determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction , the District Court addressed these considerations in only a cursory fashion . The courts entire discussion of these factors consisted of one ( albeit lengthy ) sentence : The Court is also satisfied that the balance of hardships tips in favor of granting an injunction , as the harm to the environment , Plaintiffs , and public interest outweighs the harm that Defendants would incur if prevented from using MFA sonar , absent the use of effective mitigation measures , during a subset of their regular activities in one part of one state for a limited period. Id. , at 217a218a . As the prior Ninth Circuit panel in this case put it , in staying the District Courts original preliminary injunction , [t]he district court did not give serious consideration to the public interest factor. 502 F. 3d , at 863 . The District Courts order on remand did nothing to cure this defect , but simply repeated nearly verbatim the same sentence from its previous order . Compare530 F. Supp . 2d , at 1118 , withPet . App . 217a218a . The subsequent Ninth Circuit panel framed its opinion as reviewing the District Courts exercise of discretion , 518 F. 3d , at 697699 , but that discretion was barely exercised here .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court of Appeals held that the balance of equities and the public interest favored the plaintiffs , largely based on its view that the preliminary injunction would not in fact impose a significant burden on the Navys ability to conduct its training exercises and certify its strike groups . Id. , at 698699 . The court deemed the Navys concerns about the preliminary injunction speculative because the Navy had not operated under similar procedures before . Ibid . But this is almost always the case when a plaintiff seeks injunctive relief to alter a defendants conduct . The lower courts failed properly to defer to senior Navy officers specific , predictive judgments about how the preliminary injunction would reduce the effectiveness of the Navys SOCAL training exercises . See Wright & Miller § 2948.2 , at 16768 ( The policy against the imposition of judicial restraints prior to an adjudication of the merits becomes more significant when there is reason to believe that the decree will be burdensome ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
2.The preliminary injunction requires the Navy to shut down its MFA sonar if a marine mammal is detected within 2,200 yards of a sonar - emitting vessel . The Ninth Circuit stated that the 2,200-yard shutdown zone would not be overly burdensome because sightings of marine mammals during training exercises are relatively rare . But regardless of the frequency of marine mammal sightings , the injunction will greatly increase the size of the shutdown zone . Pursuant to its exemption from the MMPA , the Navy agreed to reduce the power of its MFA sonar at 1,000 yards and 500 yards , and to completely turn off the system at 200 yards . Pet . App . 222a230a . The District Courts injunction does not include a graduated power - down , instead requiring a total shutdown of MFA sonar if a marine mammal is detected within 2,200 yards of a sonar - emitting vessel . There is an exponential relationship between radius length and surface area ( Area = r2 ) . Increasing the radius of the shutdown zone from 200 to 2,200 yards would accordingly expand the surface area of the shutdown zone by a factor of over 100 ( from 125,664 square yards to 15,205,308 square yards ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The lower courts did not give sufficient weight to the views of several top Navy officers , who emphasized that because training scenarios can take several days to develop , each additional shutdown can result in the loss of several days worth of training . Id. , at 344a . Limiting the number of sonar shutdowns is particularly important during the Joint Tactical Force Exercises , which usually last for less than two weeks . Ibid . Admiral Bird explained that the 2,200-yard shutdown zone would cause operational commanders to lose awareness of the tactical situation through the constant stopping and starting of MFA [ sonar]. Id. , at 332a ; see also i d . , at356a ( It may take days to get to the pivotal attack in antisubmarine warfare , but only minutes to confound the results upon which certification is based ) . Even if there is a low likelihood of a marine mammal sighting , the preliminary injunction would clearly increase the number of disruptive sonar shutdowns the Navy is forced to perform during its SOCAL training exercises .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court of Appeals also concluded that the 2,200-yard shutdown zone would not be overly burdensome because the Navy had shut down MFA sonar 27 times during its eight prior training exercises in SOCAL ; in several of these cases , the Navy turned off its sonar when marine mammals were spotted well beyond the Navys self - imposed 200-yard shutdown zone . 518 F. 3d , at 700 , n. 65 . Admiral Locklearthe Commander of the Navys Third Fleetstated that any shutdowns beyond the 200-yard zone were voluntary avoidance measures that likely took place at tactically insignificant times ; the Ninth Circuit discounted this explanation as not supported by the record . Ibid . In reaching this conclusion , the Court of Appeals ignored key portions of Admiral Locklears declaration , in which he stated unequivocally that commanding officers would not shut down sonar until legally required to do so if in contact with a submarine. Pet . App . 354a355a . Similarly , if a commanding officer is in contact with a target submarine , the CO will be expected to continue to use active sonar unless another ship or helicopter can gain contact or if regulatory reasons dictate otherwise. Id. , at 355a . The record supports the Navys contention that its shutdowns of MFA sonar during prior training exercises only occurred during tactically insignificant times ; those voluntary shutdowns do not justify the District Courts imposition of a mandatory2,200-yard shutdown zone .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Lastly , the Ninth Circuit stated that a 2,200-yard shutdown zone was feasible because the Navy had previously adopted a 2,000-meter zone for low - frequency active ( LFA ) sonar . The Court of Appeals failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that LFA sonar is used for long - range detection of enemy submarines , and thus its use and shutdown involve tactical considerations quite different from those associated with MFA sonar . See App . 508 ( noting that equating MFA sonar with LFA sonar is completely misleading and is like comparing 20 degrees Fahrenheit to 20 degrees Celsius ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
3.The Court of Appeals also concluded that the Navys training exercises would not be significantly affected by the requirement that it power down MFA sonar by 6 dB during significant surface ducting conditions . Again , we think the Ninth Circuit understated the burden this requirement would impose on the Navys ability to conduct realistic training exercises .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Surface ducting is a phenomenon in which relatively little sound energy penetrates beyond a narrow layer near the surface of the water . When surface ducting occurs , active sonar becomes more useful near the surface but less useful at greater depths . Pet . App . 299a300a . Diesel - electric submariners are trained to take advantage of these distortions to avoid being detected by sonar . Id. , at 333a .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Ninth Circuit determined that the power - down requirement during surface ducting conditions was unlikely to affect certification of the Navys strike groups because surface ducting occurs relatively rarely , and the Navy has previously certified strike groups that did not train under such conditions . 518 F. 3d , at 701702 . This reasoning is backwards . Given that surface ducting is both rare and unpredictable , it is especially important for the Navy to be able to train under these conditions when they occur . Admiral Bird explained that the 6 dB power - down requirement makes the training less valuable because it exposes [ sonar operators ] to unrealistically lower levels of mutual interference caused by multiple sonar systems operating together by the ships within the Strike Group. Pet . App . 281a ( footnote omitted).Although a 6 dB reduction may not seem terribly significant , decibels are measured on a logarithmic scale , so a 6 dB decrease in power equates to a 75 % reduction . Id. , at 284a285a .	@@empty@@	unmatched
4.The District Court acknowledged that  the imposition of these mitigation measures will require the Navy to alter and adapt the way it conducts antisubmarine warfare traininga substantial challenge . Nevertheless , evidence presented to the Court reflects that the Navy has employed mitigation measures in the past , without sacrificing training objectives.  527 F. Supp . 2d , at 1238 . Apparently no good deed goes unpunished . The fact that the Navy has taken measures in the past to address concerns about marine mammalsor , for that matter , has elected not to challenge four additional restrictions imposed by the District Court in this case , see supra , at 78hardly means that other , more intrusive restrictions pose no threat to preparedness for war .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court of Appeals concluded its opinion by stating that the Navy may return to the district court to request relief on an emergency basis if the preliminary injunction actually result[s ] in an inability to train and certify sufficient naval forces to provide for the national defense. 518 F. 3d , at 703 . This is cold comfort to the Navy . The Navy contends that the injunction will hinder efforts to train sonar operators under realistic conditions , ultimately leaving strike groups more vulnerable to enemy submarines . Unlike the Ninth Circuit , we do not think the Navy is required to wait until the injunction actually result[s ] in an inability to train . . . sufficient naval forces for the national defense before seeking its dissolution . By then it may be too late .	@@empty@@	unmatched
As noted above , we do not address the underlying merits of plaintiffs claims . While we have authority to proceed to such a decision at this point , see Munaf , 553 U. S. , at _ _ ( slip op . , at 1314 ) , doing so is not necessary here . In addition , reaching the merits is complicated by the fact that the lower courts addressed only one of several issues raised , and plaintiffs have largely chosen not to defend the decision below on that ground . 5	@@empty@@	unmatched
At the same time , what we have said makes clear that it would be an abuse of discretion to enter a permanent injunction , after final decision on the merits , along the same lines as the preliminary injunction . An injunction is a matter of equitable discretion ; it does not follow from success on the merits as a matter of course . Romero - Barcelo , 456 U. S. , at 313 ( a federal judge sitting as chancellor is not mechanically obligated to grant an injunction for every violation of law ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The factors examined abovethe balance of equities and consideration of the public interestare pertinent in assessing the propriety of any injunctive relief , preliminary or permanent . See Amoco Production Co. , 480 U. S. , at 546 , n. 12 ( The standard for a preliminary injunction is essentially the same as for a permanent injunction with the exception that the plaintiff must show a likelihood of success on the merits rather than actual success ) . Given that the ultimate legal claim is that the Navy must prepare an EIS , not that it must cease sonar training , there is no basis for enjoining such training in a manner credibly alleged to pose a serious threat to national security . This is particularly true in light of the fact that the training has been going on for 40 years with no documented episode of harm to a marine mammal . A court concluding that the Navy is required to prepare an EIS has many remedial tools at its disposal , including declaratory relief or an injunction tailored to the preparation of an EIS rather than the Navys training in the interim . See , e.g. , Steffel v. Thompson , 415 U. S. 452 , 466 ( 1974 ) ( Congress plainly intended declaratory relief to act as an alternative to the strong medicine of the injunction ) . In the meantime , we see no basis for jeopardizing national security , as the present injunction does . Plaintiffs confirmed at oral argument that the preliminary injunction was the whole ball game, Tr . of Oral Arg . 33 , and our analysis of the propriety of preliminary relief is applicable to any permanent injunction as well .	@@empty@@	unmatched
President Theodore Roosevelt explained that the only way in which a navy can ever be made efficient is by practice at sea , under all the conditions which would have to be met if war existed. Presidents Annual Message , 42Cong . Rec . 67 , 81 ( 1907 ) . We do not discount the importance of plaintiffs ecological , scientific , and recreational interests in marine mammals . Those interests , however , are plainly outweighed by the Navys need to conduct realistic training exercises to ensure that it is able to neutralize the threat posed by enemy submarines . The District Court abused its discretion by imposing a 2,200-yard shutdown zone and by requiring the Navy to power down its MFA sonar during significant surface ducting conditions . The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed , and the preliminary injunction is vacated to the extent it has been challenged by the Navy .	@@empty@@	unmatched

The same week that Congress submitted the Establishment Clause as part of the Bill of Rights for ratification by the States , it enacted legislation providing for paid chaplains in the House and Senate . Id. , at 788 . The day after the First Amendment was proposed , the same Congress that had proposed it requested the President to proclaim  a day of public thanksgiving and prayer , to be observed , by acknowledging , with grateful hearts , the many and signal favours of Almighty God. See H.

President Washington offered the first Thanksgiving Proclamation shortly thereafter , devoting November 26 , 1789 on behalf of the American people  to the service of that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent author of all the good that is , that was , or that will be,  Van Orden v. Perry , ante , at 78 ( plurality opinion ) ( quoting President Washingtons first Thanksgiving Proclamation ) , thus beginning a tradition of offering gratitude to God that continues today . See Wallace v. Jaffree , 472 U.

These actions of our First President and Congress and the Marshall Court were not idiosyncratic ; they reflected the beliefs of the period . Those who wrote the Constitution believed that morality was essential to the well - being of society and that encouragement of religion was the best way to foster morality .

With all of this reality ( and much more ) staring it in the face , how can the Court possibly assert that  the First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between … religion and nonreligion,  ante , at 11 , and that [m]anifesting a purpose to favor . . . adherence to religion generally, ante , at 12 , is unconstitutional ? Who says so ? Surely not the words of the Constitution . Surely not the history and traditions that reflect our societys constant understanding of those words . Surely not even the current sense of our society , recently reflected in an Act of Congress adopted unanimously by the Senate and with only 5 nays in the House of Representatives , see 148 Cong . Rec . S6226 ( 2002 ) ; i d . , at H7186 , criticizing a Court of Appeals opinion that had held under God in the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional . See Act of Nov. 13 , 2002 , § § 1(9 ) , 2(a ) , 3(a ) , 116Stat . 2057 , 2058 , 20602061 ( reaffirming the Pledge of Allegiance and the National Motto ( In God We Trust ) and stating that the Pledge of Allegiance is clearly consistent with the text and intent of the Constitution ) . Nothing stands behind the Courts assertion that governmental affirmation of the societys belief in God is unconstitutional except the Courts own say - so , citing as support only the unsubstantiated say - so of earlier Courts going back no farther than the mid-20th century . See ante , at 11 , citing Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints v. Amos , 483 U. S. 327 , 335 ( 1987 ) , in turn citing Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.

S. 1 , 15 ( 1947 ) . 2 And it is , moreover , a thoroughly discredited say - so . It is discredited , to begin with , because a majority of the Justices on the current Court ( including at least one Member of todays majority ) have , in separate opinions , repudiated the brain - spun  Lemon test that embodies the supposed principle of neutrality between religion and irreligion . See Lambs Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist . , 508 U. S. 384 , 398399 ( 1993 ) ( Scalia , J. , concurring in judgment ) ( collecting criticism of Lemon ) ; Van Orden , ante , at 1 , 6 ( Thomas , J. , concurring ) ; Board of Ed . of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist . v.

S. 646 , 671 ( 1980 ) ( Stevens , J. , dissenting ) ( disparaging the sisyphean task of trying to patch together the blurred , indistinct , and variable barrier described in Lemon  ) . And it is discredited because the Court has not had the courage ( or the foolhardiness ) to apply the neutrality principle consistently .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
What distinguishes the rule of law from the dictatorship of a shifting Supreme Court majority is the absolutely indispensable requirement that judicial opinions be grounded in consistently applied principle . That is what prevents judges from ruling now this way , now thatthumbs up or thumbs downas their personal preferences dictate . Todays opinion forthrightly ( or actually , somewhat less than forthrightly ) admits that it does not rest upon consistently applied principle . In a revealing footnote , ante , at 11 , n. 10 , the Court acknowledges that the Establishment Clause doctrine it purports to be applying lacks the comfort of categorical absolutes. What the Court means by this lovely euphemism is that sometimes the Court chooses to decide cases on the principle that government can not favor religion , and sometimes it does not . The footnote goes on to say that [i]n special instances we have found good reason to dispense with the principle , but [n]o such reasons present themselves here. Ibid . It does not identify all of those special instances, much less identify the good reason for their existence .	@@empty@@	unmatched
I have cataloged elsewhere the variety of circumstances in which this Courteven after its embrace of Lemon s stated prohibition of such behaviorhas approved government action undertaken with the specific intention of improving the position of religion, Edwards v. Aguillard , 482 U. S. 578 , 616 ( 1987 ) ( Scalia , J. , dissenting ) . See i d . , 616618 . Suffice it to say here that when the government relieves churches from the obligation to pay property taxes , when it allows students to absent themselves from public school to take religious classes , and when it exempts religious organizations from generally applicable prohibitions of religious discrimination , it surely means to bestow a benefit on religious practicebut we have approved it . See Amos , supra , at 338 ( exemption from federal prohibition of religious discrimination by employers ) ; Walz v. Tax Commn of City of New York , 397 U. S. 664 , 673 ( 1970 ) ( property tax exemption for church property ) ; Zorach , 343 U. S. , at 308 , 315 ( law permitting students to leave public school for the purpose of receiving religious education ) . Indeed , we have even approved ( post- Lemon ) government - led prayer to God . In Marsh v. Chambers , supra , the Court upheld the Nebraska State Legislatures practice of paying a chaplain to lead it in prayer at the opening of legislative sessions . The Court explained that [t]o invoke Divine guidance on a public body entrusted with making the laws is not . . . an establishment of religion or a step toward establishment ; it is simply a tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country. 463 U. S. , at 792 . ( Why , one wonders , is not respect for the Ten Commandments a tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country ? )	@@empty@@	unmatched
The only good reason for ignoring the neutrality principle set forth in any of these cases was the antiquity of the practice at issue . See Marsh , supra , at 786792 , 794 ; Walz , supra , at 676680 . That would be a good reason for finding the neutrality principle a mistaken interpretation of the Constitution , but it is hardly a good reason for letting an unconstitutional practice continue . We did not hide behind that reason in Reynolds v. Sims , 377 U. S. 533 ( 1964 ) , which found unconstitutional bicameral state legislatures of a sort that had existed since the beginning of the Republic . And almost monthly , it seems , the Court has not shrunk from invalidating aspects of criminal procedure and penology of similar vintage . See , e.g. , Deck v. Missouri , 544 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2005 ) ( slip op . , at 1011 ) ( invalidating practice of shackling defendants absent special circumstances ) ; i d . , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 711 ) ( Thomas , J. , dissenting ) ; Roper v. Simmons , 543 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2005 ) ( slip op . , at 14 ) ( invalidating practice of executing under-18-year - old offenders ) ; i d . , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 2 , n. 1 ) ( Scalia , J. , dissenting ) . What , then , could be the genuine good reason for occasionally ignoring the neutrality principle ? I suggest it is the instinct for self - preservation , and the recognition that the Court , which has no influence over either the sword or the purse, The Federalist No . 78 , p. 412 ( J. Pole ed . 2005 ) , can not go too far down the road of an enforced neutrality that contradicts both historical fact and current practice without losing all that sustains it : the willingness of the people to accept its interpretation of the Constitution as definitive , in preference to the contrary interpretation of the democratically elected branches .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Besides appealing to the demonstrably false principle that the government can not favor religion over irreligion , todays opinion suggests that the posting of the Ten Commandments violates the principle that the government can not favor one religion over another . See ante , at 19 ; see also Van Orden , ante , at 1113 ( Stevens , J. , dissenting ) . That is indeed a valid principle where public aid or assistance to religion is concerned , see Zelman v. Simmons - Harris , 536 U. S. 639 , 652 ( 2002 ) , or where the free exercise of religion is at issue , Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye , Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U. S. 520 , 532533 ( 1993 ) ; i d . , at 557558 ( Scalia , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) , but it necessarily applies in a more limited sense to public acknowledgment of the Creator . If religion in the public forum had to be entirely nondenominational , there could be no religion in the public forum at all . One can not say the word God, or the Almighty, one can not offer public supplication or thanksgiving , without contradicting the beliefs of some people that there are many gods , or that God or the gods pay no attention to human affairs . With respect to public acknowledgment of religious belief , it is entirely clear from our Nations historical practices that the Establishment Clause permits this disregard of polytheists and believers in unconcerned deities , just as it permits the disregard of devout atheists . The Thanksgiving Proclamation issued by George Washington at the instance of the First Congress was scrupulously nondenominationalbut it was monotheistic . In Marsh v. Chambers , supra , we said that the fact the particular prayers offered in the Nebraska Legislature were in the Judeo - Christian tradition, i d . , at 793 , posed no additional problem , because there is no indication that the prayer opportunity has been exploited to proselytize or advance any one , or to disparage any other , faith or belief, i d . , at 794795 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Historical practices thus demonstrate that there is a distance between the acknowledgment of a single Creator and the establishment of a religion . The former is , as Marsh v. Chambers put it , a tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country. Id. , at 792 . The three most popular religions in the United States , Christianity , Judaism , and Islamwhich combined account for 97.7 % of all believersare monotheistic . See U. S. Dept . of Commerce , Bureau of Census , Statistical Abstract of the United States : 20042005 , p. 55 ( 124th ed . 2004 ) ( Table No . 67 ) . All of them , moreover ( Islam included ) , believe that the Ten Commandments were given by God to Moses , and are divine prescriptions for a virtuous life . See 13 Encyclopedia of Religion 9074 ( 2d ed . 2005 ) ; The Quran 104 ( M. Haleem trans . 2004 ) . Publicly honoring the Ten Commandments is thus indistinguishable , insofar as discriminating against other religions is concerned , from publicly honoring God . Both practices are recognized across such a broad and diverse range of the populationfrom Christians to Muslimsthat they can not be reasonably understood as a government endorsement of a particular religious viewpoint . 4	@@empty@@	unmatched
A few remarks are necessary in response to the criticism of this dissent by the Court , as well as Justice Stevens criticism in the related case of Van Orden v. Perry , ante , p. 1 . < font scaps="1" > Justice Stevens  writing is largely devoted to an attack upon a straw man . [R]eliance on early religious proclamations and statements made by the Founders is … problematic, he says , because those views were not espoused at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 nor enshrined in the Constitutions text. Van Orden , ante , at 1819 ( dissenting opinion ) ( footnote omitted ) . But I have not relied upon ( as he and the Court in this case do ) mere proclamations and statements of the Founders . I have relied primarily upon official acts and official proclamations of the United States or of the component branches of its Government , including the First Congresss beginning of the tradition of legislative prayer to God , its appointment of congressional chaplains , its legislative proposal of a Thanksgiving Proclamation , and its reenactment of the Northwest Territory Ordinance ; our first Presidents issuance of a Thanksgiving Proclamation ; and invocation of God at the opening of sessions of the Supreme Court . The only mere proclamations and statements of the Founders I have relied upon were statements of Founders who occupied federal office , and spoke in at least a quasi - official capacityWashingtons prayer at the opening of his Presidency and his Farewell Address , President John Adams letter to the Massachusetts Militia , and Jeffersons and Madisons inaugural addresses . The Court and Justice Stevens , by contrast , appeal to no official or even quasi - official action in support of their view of the Establishment Clauseonly James Madisons Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments , written before the federal Constitution had even been proposed , two letters written by Madison long after he was President , and the quasi - official inaction of Thomas Jefferson in refusing to issue a Thanksgiving Proclamation . See ante , at 3031 ; Van Orden , ante , at 19 ( Stevens , J. , dissenting ) . The Madison Memorial and Remonstrance , dealing as it does with enforced contribution to religion rather than public acknowledgment of God , is irrelevant ; one of the letters is utterly ambiguous as to the point at issue here , and should not be read to contradict Madisons statements in his first inaugural address , quoted earlier ; even the other letter does not disapprove public acknowledgment of God , unless one posits ( what Madisons own actions as President would contradict ) that reference to God contradicts the equality of all religious sects. See Letter from James Madison to Edward Livingston ( July 10 , 1822 ) , in 5 The Founders Constitution 105106 ( P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds . 1987 ) . And as to Jefferson : the notoriously self - contradicting Jefferson did not choose to have his nonauthorship of a Thanksgiving Proclamation inscribed on his tombstone . What he did have inscribed was his authorship of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom , a governmental act which begins Whereas Almighty God hath created the mind free . . . . Va. Code Ann . § 571 ( Lexis 2003 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is no answer for Justice Stevens to say that the understanding that these official and quasi - official actions reflect was not enshrined in the Constitutions text. Van Orden , ante , at 18 ( dissenting opinion ) . The Establishment Clause , upon which Justice Stevens would rely , was enshrined in the Constitutions text , and these official actions show what it meant . There were doubtless some who thought it should have a broader meaning , but those views were plainly rejected . Justice Stevens says that reliance on these actions is bound to paint a misleading picture, Van Orden , ante , at 19 , but it is hard to see why . What is more probative of the meaning of the Establishment Clause than the actions of the very Congress that proposed it , and of the first President charged with observing it ?	@@empty@@	unmatched
Justice Stevens also appeals to the undoubted fact that some in the founding generation thought that the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment should have a narrower meaning , protecting only the Christian religion or perhaps only Protestantism . See Van Orden , ante , at 2022 . I am at a loss to see how this helps his case , except by providing a cloud of obfuscating smoke . ( Since most thought the Clause permitted government invocation of monotheism , and some others thought it permitted government invocation of Christianity , he proposes that it be construed not to permit any government invocation of religion at all . ) At any rate , those narrower views of the Establishment Clause were as clearly rejected as the more expansive ones . Washingtons First Thanksgiving Proclamation is merely an example . All of the actions of Washington and the First Congress upon which I have relied , virtually all Thanksgiving Proclamations throughout our history , 5 and all the other examples of our Governments favoring religion that I have cited , have invoked God , but not Jesus Christ . 6 Rather than relying upon Justice Stevens  assurance that [t]he original understanding of the type of religion that qualified for constitutional protection under the First amendment certainly did not include . . . followers of Judaism and Islam, Van Orden , ante , at 22 ; see also ante , at 3233 , I would prefer to take the word of George Washington , who , in his famous Letter to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport , Rhode Island , wrote that ,	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9

Justice Stevens says that if one is serious about following the original understanding of the Establishment Clause , he must repudiate its incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment , and hold that it does not apply against the States . See Van Orden , ante , at 2426 ( dissenting opinion ) . This is more smoke . Justice Stevens did not feel that way last Term , when he joined an opinion insisting upon the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause , but nonetheless applying it against the State of Washington . See Crawford v. Washington , 541 U. S. 36 ( 2004 ) . The notion that incorporation empties the incorporated provisions of their original meaning has no support in either reason or precedent .	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each state , excluding Indians not taxed . But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof . But Congress may by a vote of two - thirds of each House , remove such disability . The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law , including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion , shall not be questioned . But neither the United States nor any state shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States , or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave ; but all such debts , obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void . The Congress shall have power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article .	56
Justice Stevens argues that original meaning should not be the touchstone anyway , but that we should rather expoun[d ] the meaning of constitutional provisions with one eye towards our Nations history and the other fixed on its democratic aspirations. Van Orden , ante , at 2728 ( dissenting opinion ) . This is not the place to debate the merits of the living Constitution, though I must observe that Justice Stevens quotation from McCulloch v. Maryland , 4 Wheat . 316 , 407 ( 1819 ) , refutes rather than supports that approach . 7 Even assuming , however , that the meaning of the Constitution ought to change according to democratic aspirations, why are those aspirations to be found in Justices notions of what the Establishment Clause ought to mean , rather than in the democratically adopted dispositions of our current society ? As I have observed above , numerous provisions of our laws and numerous continuing practices of our people demonstrate that the governments invocation of God ( and hence the governments invocation of the Ten Commandments ) is unobjectionableincluding a statute enacted by Congress almost unanimously less than three years ago , stating that under God in the Pledge of Allegiance is constitutional , see 116 Stat . , at 2058 . To ignore all this is not to give effect to democratic aspirations but to frustrate them .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Finally , I must respond to Justice Stevens  assertion that I would marginaliz[e ] the belief systems of more than 7 million Americans who adhere to religions that are not monotheistic . Van Orden , ante , at 1314 , n. 18 ( dissenting opinion ) . Surely that is a gross exaggeration . The beliefs of those citizens are entirely protected by the Free Exercise Clause , and by those aspects of the Establishment Clause that do not relate to government acknowledgment of the Creator . Invocation of God despite their beliefs is permitted not because nonmonotheistic religions cease to be religions recognized by the religion clauses of the First Amendment , but because governmental invocation of God is not an establishment . Justice Stevens fails to recognize that in the context of public acknowledgments of God there are legitimate competing interests : On the one hand , the interest of that minority in not feeling excluded ; but on the other , the interest of the overwhelming majority of religious believers in being able to give God thanks and supplication as a people , and with respect to our national endeavors . Our national tradition has resolved that conflict in favor of the majority . 8 It is not for this Court to change a disposition that accounts , many Americans think , for the phenomenon remarked upon in a quotation attributed to various authors , including Bismarck , but which I prefer to associate with Charles de Gaulle : God watches over little children , drunkards , and the United States of America.	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
As bad as the Lemon test is , it is worse for the fact that , since its inception , its seemingly simple mandates have been manipulated to fit whatever result the Court aimed to achieve . Todays opinion is no different . In two respects it modifies Lemon to ratchet up the Courts hostility to religion . First , the Court justifies inquiry into legislative purpose , not as an end itself , but as a means to ascertain the appearance of the government action to an  objective observer.  Ante , at 13 . Because in the Courts view the true danger to be guarded against is that the objective observer would feel like an outside[r] or not [ a ] full membe[r ] of the political community, its inquiry focuses not on the actual purpose of government action , but the purpose apparent from government action. Ante , at 12 . Under this approach , even if a government could show that its actual purpose was not to advance religion , it would presumably violate the Constitution as long as the Courts objective observer would think otherwise . See Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd . v. Pinette , 515 U.S. 753 , 776777 ( 1995 ) ( OConnor , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) ( stating that when the reasonable observer would view a government practice as endorsing religion , . . . it is our duty to hold the practice invalid, even if the law at issue was neutral and the benefit conferred on the religious entity was incidental ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
I have remarked before that it is an odd jurisprudence that bases the unconstitutionality of a government practice that does not actually advance religion on the hopes of the government that it would do so . See Edwards , 482 U. S. , at 639 . But that oddity pales in comparison to the one invited by todays analysis : the legitimacy of a government action with a wholly secular effect would turn on the misperception of an imaginary observer that the government officials behind the action had the intent to advance religion .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Second , the Court replaces Lemon s requirement that the government have  a secular . . . purpose, 403 U. S. , at 612 ( emphasis added ) , with the heightened requirement that the secular purpose predominate over any purpose to advance religion . Ante , at 1517 . The Court treats this extension as a natural outgrowth of the longstanding requirement that the governments secular purpose not be a sham , but simple logic shows the two to be unrelated . If the governments proffered secular purpose is not genuine , then the government has no secular purpose at all . The new demand that secular purpose predominate contradicts Lemon s more limited requirement , and finds no support in our cases . In all but one of the five cases in which this Court has invalidated a government practice on the basis of its purpose to benefit religion , it has first declared that the statute was motivated entirely by the desire to advance religion . See Santa Fe Independent School Dist . v. Doe , 530 U. S. 290 , 308309 ( 2000 ) ( dismissing the school districts proffered secular purposes as shams ) ; Wallace , 472 U. S. , at 56 ( finding  no secular purpose ) ( emphasis added ) ; Stone v. Graham , 449 U. S. 39 , 41 ( 1980 ) ( per curiam ) ( finding that Kentuckys statute requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school rooms has no secular legislative purpose  ) ( emphasis added ) ; Epperson v. Arkansas , 393 U. S. 97 , 107109 ( 1968 ) . In Edwards , supra , the Court did say that the state action was invalid because its primary or preeminent purpose was to advance a particular religious belief , 482 U. S. , at 590 , 593 , 594 , but that statement was unnecessary to the result , since the Court rejected the States only proffered secular purpose as a sham . See i d . , at 589 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
I have urged that Lemon s purpose prong be abandoned , because ( as I have discussed in Part I ) even an exclusive purpose to foster or assist religious practice is not necessarily invalidating . But todays extension makes things even worse . By shifting the focus of Lemon s purpose prong from the search for a genuine , secular motivation to the hunt for a predominantly religious purpose , the Court converts what has in the past been a fairly limited inquiry into a rigorous review of the full record . 9 Those responsible for the adoption of the Religion Clauses would surely regard it as a bitter irony that the religious values they designed those Clauses to protect have now become so distasteful to this Court that if they constitute anything more than a subordinate motive for government action they will invalidate it .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Even accepting the Courts Lemon -based premises , the displays at issue here were constitutional .	@@empty@@	unmatched
To any person who happened to walk down the hallway of the McCreary or Pulaski County Courthouse during the roughly nine months when the Foundations Displays were exhibited , the displays must have seemed unremarkableif indeed they were noticed at all . The walls of both courthouses were already lined with historical documents and other assorted portraits ; each Foundations Display was exhibited in the same format as these other displays and nothing in the record suggests that either County took steps to give it greater prominence .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Entitled The Foundations of American Law and Government Display, each display consisted of nine equally sized documents : the original version of the Magna Carta , the Declaration of Independence , the Bill of Rights , the Star Spangled Banner , the Mayflower Compact of 1620 , a picture of Lady Justice , the National Motto of the United States ( In God We Trust ) , the Preamble to the Kentucky Constitution , and the Ten Commandments . The displays did not emphasize any of the nine documents in any way : The frame holding the Ten Commandments was of the same size and had the same appearance as that which held each of the other documents . See 354 F. 3d 438 , 443 ( CA6 2003 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Posted with the documents was a plaque , identifying the display , and explaining that it contains documents that played a significant role in the foundation of our system of law and government. Ibid . The explanation related to the Ten Commandments was third in the list of nine and did not serve to distinguish it from the other documents . It stated :	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Ten Commandments have profoundly influenced the formation of Western legal thought and the formation of our country . That influence is clearly seen in the Declaration of Independence , which declared that , We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty , and the pursuit of Happiness. The Ten Commandments provide the moral background of the Declaration of Independence and the foundation of our legal tradition. Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On its face , the Foundations Displays manifested the purely secular purpose that the Counties asserted before the District Court : to display documents that played a significant role in the foundation of our system of law and government. Affidavit of Judge Jimmie Green in Support of Defendants Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion for Contempt or , in the Alternative , for Supplemental Preliminary Injunction in Civ . A. No . 99507 ( ED Ky. ) , p. 2 . That the Displays included the Ten Commandments did not transform their apparent secular purpose into one of impermissible advocacy for Judeo - Christian beliefs . Even an isolated display of the Decalogue conveys , at worst , an equivocal message , perhaps of respect for Judaism , for religion in general , or for law. Allegheny County , 492 U. S. , at 652 ( Stevens , J. , concurring in part and dissenting in part ) . But when the Ten Commandments appear alongside other documents of secular significance in a display devoted to the foundations of American law and government , the context communicates that the Ten Commandments are included , not to teach their binding nature as a religious text , but to show their unique contribution to the development of the legal system . See i d . , at 652653 . This is doubly true when the display is introduced by a document that informs passersby that it contains documents that played a significant role in the foundation of our system of law and government.	@@empty@@	unmatched
The same result follows if the Ten Commandments display is viewed in light of the government practices that this Court has countenanced in the past . The acknowledgment of the contribution that religion in general , and the Ten Commandments in particular , have made to our Nations legal and governmental heritage is surely no more of a step towards establishment of religion than was the practice of legislative prayer we approved in Marsh v. Chambers , 463 U. S. 783 ( 1983 ) , and it seems to be on par with the inclusion of a crčche or a menorah in a Holiday display that incorporates other secular symbols , see Lynch , supra , at 679680 ; Allegheny County , supra , at 621 . The parallels between this case and Marsh and Lynch are sufficiently compelling that they ought to decide this case , even under the Courts misguided Establishment Clause jurisprudence . 10	@@empty@@	unmatched
Acknowledgment of the contribution that religion has made to our Nations legal and governmental heritage partakes of a centuries - old tradition . Members of this Court have themselves often detailed the degree to which religious belief pervaded the National Government during the founding era . See Lynch , supra , at 674678 ; Marsh , supra , at 786788 ; Lee v. Weisman , 505 U. S. 577 , 633636 ( 1992 ) ( Scalia , J. , dissenting ) ; Wallace , 472 U. S. at 100106 ( Rehnquist , J. , dissenting ) ; Engel v. Vitale , 370 U. S. 421 , and n. 3 ( 1962 ) ( Stewart , J. , dissenting ) . Display of the Ten Commandments is well within the mainstream of this practice of acknowledgment . Federal , State , and local governments across the Nation have engaged in such display . 11 The Supreme Court Building itself includes depictions of Moses with the Ten Commandments in the Courtroom and on the east pediment of the building , and symbols of the Ten Commandments adorn the metal gates lining the north and south sides of the Courtroom as well as the doors leading into the Courtroom. Van Orden , ante , at 9 ( plurality opinion ) . Similar depictions of the Decalogue appear on public buildings and monuments throughout our Nations Capital . Ibid . The frequency of these displays testifies to the popular understanding that the Ten Commandments are a foundation of the rule of law , and a symbol of the role that religion played , and continues to play , in our system of government .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Perhaps in recognition of the centrality of the Ten Commandments as a widely recognized symbol of religion in public life , the Court is at pains to dispel the impression that its decision will require governments across the country to sandblast the Ten Commandments from the public square . See ante , at 26 . The constitutional problem , the Court says , is with the Counties purpose in erecting the Foundations Displays , not the displays themselves . The Court adds in a footnote : One consequence of taking account of the purpose underlying past actions is that the same government action may be constitutional if taken in the first instance and unconstitutional if it has a sectarian heritage. Ante , at 18 , n. 14 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This inconsistency may be explicable in theory , but I suspect that the objective observer with whom the Court is so concerned will recognize its absurdity in practice . By virtue of details familiar only to the parties to litigation and their lawyers , McCreary and Pulaski Counties , Kentucky , and Rutherford County , Tennessee , have been ordered to remove the same display that appears in courthouses from Mercer County , Kentucky to Elkhart County , Indiana . Compare American Civil Liberties Union of Tenn. v. Rutherford County , 209 F. Supp . 2d 799 , 808809 ( MD Tenn. 2002 ) ( holding Foundations Display to be unconstitutional based on prior actions of county commission ) with Books v. Elkhart County , 401 F. 3d 857 , 869 ( CA7 2005 ) ( sustaining Foundations Display as secular . . . in its purpose and effect ) ; American Civil Liberties Union of Ky. v. Mercer County , 219 F. Supp . 2d 777 , 787789 ( ED Ky. 2002 ) ( rejecting Establishment Clause challenge to an identical Foundations Display and distinguishing McCreary County on the ground that the Countys purpose had not been tainted with any prior history ) . Displays erected in silence ( and under the direction of good legal advice ) are permissible , while those hung after discussion and debate are deemed unconstitutional . Reduction of the Establishment Clause to such minutiae trivializes the Clauses protection against religious establishment ; indeed , it may inflame religious passions by making the passing comments of every government official the subject of endless litigation .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In any event , the Courts conclusion that the Counties exhibited the Foundations Displays with the purpose of promoting religion is doubtful . In the Courts view , the impermissible motive was apparent from the initial displays of the Ten Commandments all by themselves : When that occurs , the Court says , a religious object is unmistakable. Ante , at 21 . Surely that can not be . If , as discussed above , the Commandments have a proper place in our civic history , even placing them by themselves can be civically motivatedespecially when they are placed , not in a school ( as they were in the Stone case upon which the Court places such reliance ) , but in a courthouse . Cf . Van Orden , ante , at 4 ( Breyer , J. , concurring in judgment ) ( The circumstances surrounding the displays placement on the capital grounds , and its physical setting suggest that the State itself intended the … nonreligious aspects of the tablets message to predominate ) . And the fact that at the posting of the exhibit a clergyman was present is unremarkable ( clergymen taking particular pride in the role of the Ten Commandments in our civic history ) ; and even more unremarkable the fact that the clergyman testified to the certainty of the existence of God, ante , at 21 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In Brooks Furniture , the Federal Circuit imported the PRE standard into § 285 . See 393 F. 3d , at 1381 . But the PRE standard finds no roots in the text of § 285 , and it makes little sense in the context of determining whether a case is so “ exceptional ” as to justify an award of attorney ’s fees in patent litigation . We crafted the Noerr - Pennington doctrine — and carved out only a narrow exception for “ sham ” litigation — to avoid chilling the exercise of the First Amendment right to petition the government for the redress of grievances . See PRE , 508 U. S. , at 56 ( “ Those who petition government for redress are generally immune from antitrust liability ” ) . But to the extent that patent suits are similarly protected as acts of petitioning , it is not clear why the shifting of fees in an “ exceptional ” case would diminish that right . The threat of antitrust liability ( and the attendant treble damages , 15 U. S. C. § 15 ) far more significantly chills the exercise of the right to petition than does the mere shifting of attorney ’s fees . In the Noerr - Pennington context , defendants seek immunity from a judicial declaration that their filing of a lawsuit was actually unlawful ; here , they seek immunity from a far less onerous declaration that they should bear the costs of that lawsuit in exceptional cases .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
We reject Brooks Furniture for another reason : It is so demanding that it would appear to render § 285 largely superfluous . We have long recognized a common - law exception to the general “ American rule ” against fee - shifting — an exception , “ inherent ” in the “ power [ of ] the courts ” that applies for “ ‘ willful disobedience of a court order’ ” or “ when the losing party has ‘ acted in bad faith , vexatiously , wantonly , or for oppressive reasons . . . .’ ” Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society , 421 U. S. 240–259 ( 1975 ) . We have twice declined to construe fee - shifting provisions narrowly on the basis that doing so would render them superfluous , given the background exception to the American rule , see Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC , 434 U. S. 412 , 419 ( 1978 ) ; Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises , Inc. , 390 U. S. 400 , n. 4 ( 1968 ) ( per curiam ) , and we again decline to do so here .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Finally , we reject the Federal Circuit ’s requirement that patent litigants establish their entitlement to fees under § 285 by “ clear and convincing evidence , ” Brooks Furniture , 393 F. 3d , at 1382 . We have not interpreted comparable fee - shifting statutes to require proof of entitlement to fees by clear and convincing evidence . See , e.g. , Fogerty , 510 U. S. , at 519 ; Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp. , 496 U. S. 384 ( 1990 ) ; Pierce v. Underwood , 487 U. S. 552 , 558 ( 1988 ) . And nothing in § 285 justifies such a high standard of proof . Section 285 demands a simple discretionary inquiry ; it imposes no specific evidentiary burden , much less such a high one . Indeed , patent - infringement litigation has always been governed by a preponderance of the evidence standard , see , e.g. , Béné v. Jeantet , 129 U. S. 683 , 688 ( 1889 ) , and that is the “ standard generally applicable in civil actions , ” because it “ allows both parties to ‘ share the risk of error in roughly equal fashion,’ ” Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston , 459 U. S. 375 , 390 ( 1983 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Respondent John Roe , a San Diego police officer , made a video showing himself stripping off a police uniform and masturbating . He sold the video on the adults - only section of eBay , the popular online auction site . His user name was Codestud3@aol.com, a word play on a high priority police radio call . 356 F. 3d 1108 , 1110 ( CA9 2004 ) . The uniform apparently was not the specific uniform worn by the San Diego police , but it was clearly identifiable as a police uniform . Roe also sold custom videos , as well as police equipment , including official uniforms of the San Diego Police Department ( SDPD ) , and various other items such as mens underwear . Roes eBay user profile identified him as employed in the field of law enforcement .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Roes supervisor , a police sergeant , discovered Roes activities when , while on eBay , he came across an official SDPD police uniform for sale offered by an individual with the username Codestud3@aol.com. He searched for other items Codestud3 offered and discovered listings for Roes videos depicting the objectionable material . Recognizing Roes picture , the sergeant printed images of certain of Roes offerings and shared them with others in Roes chain of command , including a police captain . The captain notified the SDPDs internal affairs department , which began an investigation . In response to a request by an undercover officer , Roe produced a custom video . It showed Roe , again in police uniform , issuing a traffic citation but revoking it after undoing the uniform and masturbating .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The investigation revealed that Roes conduct violated specific SDPD policies , including conduct unbecoming of an officer , outside employment , and immoral conduct . When confronted , Roe admitted to selling the videos and police paraphernalia . The SDPD ordered Roe to cease displaying , manufacturing , distributing or selling any sexually explicit materials or engaging in any similar behaviors , via the internet , U. S. Mail , commercial vendors or distributors , or any other medium available to the public. 356 F. 3d , at 1111 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . Although Roe removed some of the items he had offered for sale , he did not change his sellers profile , which described the first two videos he had produced and listed their prices as well as the prices for custom videos . After discovering Roes failure to follow its orders , the SDPDciting Roe for the added violation of disobedience of lawful ordersbegan termination proceedings . The proceedings resulted in Roes dismissal from the police force .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Roe brought suit in the District Court pursuant to Rev. Stat . § 1979 , 42 U. S. C. § 1983 , alleging that the employment termination violated his First Amendment right to free speech . In granting summary judgment to the City , the District Court decided that Roe had not demonstrated that selling official police uniforms and producing , marketing , and selling sexually explicit videos for profit qualified as expression relating to a matter of public concern under this Courts decision in Connick v. Myers , 461 U. S. 138 ( 1983 ) .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
In reversing , the Court of Appeals held Roes conduct fell within the protected category of citizen commentary on matters of public concern . Central to the Court of Appeals conclusion was that Roes expression was not an internal workplace grievance , took place while he was off - duty and away from his employers premises , and was unrelated to his employment . 356 F. 3d , at 1110 , 11131114 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A government employee does not relinquish all First Amendment rights otherwise enjoyed by citizens just by reason of his or her employment . See , e.g. , Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ . of State of N. Y. , 385 U. S. 589 , 605606 ( 1967 ) . On the other hand , a governmental employer may impose certain restraints on the speech of its employees , restraints that would be unconstitutional if applied to the general public . The Court has recognized the right of employees to speak on matters of public concern , typically matters concerning government policies that are of interest to the public at large , a subject on which public employees are uniquely qualified to comment . See Connick , supra ; Pickering v. Board of Ed . of Township High School Dist . 205 , Will Cty . , 391 U. S. 563 ( 1968 ) . Outside of this category , the Court has held that when government employees speak or write on their own time on topics unrelated to their employment , the speech can have First Amendment protection , absent some governmental justification far stronger than mere speculation in regulating it . United States v. Treasury Employees , 513 U. S. 454 , 465 , 475 ( 1995 ) ( NTEU ) . We have little difficulty in concluding that the City was not barred from terminating Roe under either line of cases .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
In concluding that Roes activities qualified as a matter of public concern , the Court of Appeals relied heavily on the Courts decision in NTEU . 356 F. 3d , at 1117 . In NTEU it was established that the speech was unrelated to the employment and had no effect on the mission and purpose of the employer . The question was whether the Federal Government could impose certain monetary limitations on outside earnings from speaking or writing on a class of federal employees . The Court held that , within the particular classification of employment , the Government had shown no justification for the outside salary limitations . The First Amendment right of the employees sufficed to invalidate the restrictions on the outside earnings for such activities . The Court noted that throughout history public employees who undertook to write or to speak in their spare time had made substantial contributions to literature and art , NTEU , supra , at 465 , and observed that none of the speech at issue even arguably [ had ] any adverse impact on the employer . Ibid .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
The Court of Appeals reliance on NTEU was seriously misplaced . Although Roes activities took place outside the workplace and purported to be about subjects not related to his employment , the SDPD demonstrated legitimate and substantial interests of its own that were compromised by his speech . Far from confining his activities to speech unrelated to his employment , Roe took deliberate steps to link his videos and other wares to his police work , all in a way injurious to his employer . The use of the uniform , the law enforcement reference in the Web site , the listing of the speaker as in the field of law enforcement, and the debased parody of an officer performing indecent acts while in the course of official duties brought the mission of the employer and the professionalism of its officers into serious disrepute . 356 F. 3d , at 1111 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court of Appeals noted the City conceded Roes activities were unrelated to his employment . Id. , at 1112 , n. 4 . In the context of the pleadings and arguments , the proper interpretation of the Citys statement is simply to underscore the obvious proposition that Roes speech was not a comment on the workings or functioning of the SDPD . It is quite a different question whether the speech was detrimental to the SDPD . On that score the Citys consistent position has been that the speech is contrary to its regulations and harmful to the proper functioning of the police force . The present case falls outside the protection afforded in NTEU . The authorities that instead control , and which are considered below , are this Courts decisions in Pickering , supra , Connick , supra , and the decisions which follow them .	@@empty@@	unmatched
To reconcile the employees right to engage in speech and the government employers right to protect its own legitimate interests in performing its mission , the Pickering Court adopted a balancing test . It requires a court evaluating restraints on a public employees speech to balance the interests of the [ employee ] , as a citizen , in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State , as an employer , in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees. 391 U. S. , at 568 ; see also Connick , supra , at 142 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Underlying the decision in Pickering is the recognition that public employees are often the members of the community who are likely to have informed opinions as to the operations of their public employers , operations which are of substantial concern to the public . Were they not able to speak on these matters , the community would be deprived of informed opinions on important public issues . See 391 U. S. , at 572 . The interest at stake is as much the publics interest in receiving informed opinion as it is the employees own right to disseminate it .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Pickering did not hold that any and all statements by a public employee are entitled to balancing . To require Pickering balancing in every case where speech by a public employee is at issue , no matter the content of the speech , could compromise the proper functioning of government offices . See Connick , 461 U. S. , at 143 . This concern prompted the Court in Connick to explain a threshold inquiry ( implicit in Pickering itself ) that in order to merit Pickering balancing , a public employees speech must touch on a matter of public concern. 461 U. S. , at 143 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In Connick , an assistant district attorney , unhappy with her supervisors decision to transfer her to another division , circulated an intraoffice questionnaire . The document solicited her co - workers views on , inter alia , office transfer policy , office morale , the need for grievance committees , the level of confidence in supervisors , and whether employees felt pressured to work in political campaigns . See i d . , at 141 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Finding thatwith the exception of the final questionthe questionnaire touched not on matters of public concern but on internal workplace grievances , the Court held no Pickering balancing was required . 461 U. S. , at 141 . To conclude otherwise would ignore the common - sense realization that government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter. I d . , at 143 . Connick held that a public employees speech is entitled to Pickering balancing only when the employee speaks as a citizen upon matters of public concern rather than as an employee upon matters only of personal interest. 461 U. S. , at 147 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Although the boundaries of the public concern test are not well - defined , Connick provides some guidance . It directs courts to examine the content , form , and context of a given statement , as revealed by the whole record in assessing whether an employees speech addresses a matter of public concern . I d . , at 146147 . In addition , it notes that the standard for determining whether expression is of public concern is the same standard used to determine whether a common - law action for invasion of privacy is present . I d . , at 143 , n. 5 . That standard is established by our decisions in Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn , 420 U. S. 469 ( 1975 ) , and Time , Inc. v. Hill , 385 U. S. 374 , 387388 ( 1967 ) . These cases make clear that public concern is something that is a subject of legitimate news interest ; that is , a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public at the time of publication . The Court has also recognized that certain private remarks , such as negative comments about the President of the United States , touch on matters of public concern and should thus be subject to Pickering balancing . See Rankin v. McPherson , 483 U. S. 378 ( 1987 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Applying these principles to the instant case , there is no difficulty in concluding that Roes expression does not qualify as a matter of public concern under any view of the public concern test . He fails the threshold test and Pickering balancing does not come into play .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Connick is controlling precedent , but to show why this is not a close case it is instructive to note that even under the view expressed by the dissent in Connick from four Members of the Court , the speech here would not come within the definition of a matter of public concern . The dissent in Connick would have held that the entirety of the questionnaire circulated by the employee discussed subjects that could reasonably be expected to be of interest to persons seeking to develop informed opinions about the manner in which . . . an elected official charged with managing a vital governmental agency , discharges his responsibilities. 461 U. S. , at 163 ( opinion of Brennan , J. ) . No similar purpose could be attributed to the employees speech in the present case . Roes activities did nothing to inform the public about any aspect of the SDPDs functioning or operation . Nor were Roes activities anything like the private remarks at issue in Rankin , where one co - worker commented to another co - worker on an item of political news . Roes expression was widely broadcast , linked to his official status as a police officer , and designed to exploit his employers image .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The speech in question was detrimental to the mission and functions of the employer . There is no basis for finding that it was of concern to the community as the Courts cases have understood that term in the context of restrictions by governmental entities on the speech of their employees .	@@empty@@	unmatched

The sole issue in this patent infringement suit , filed in the Northern District of Indiana , is whether as a matter of law respondent Allbright - Nell Co. , an Illinois manufacturer , by openly assuming and controlling in this action the defense of its customer , respondent Peter Eckrich & Sons , Inc. , of Indiana , subjected itself to the jurisdiction of that court and waived the statutory venue requirements of 28 U.S.C. 1400(b ) , 28 U.S.C.A. § 1400(b ) . 1 The motion of Allbright - Nell to dismiss as to it because venue in the Northern District of Indiana was improper was sustained without opinion . The Court of Appeals affirmed , 279 F.2d 594 . 2 We granted certiorari , 364 U.S. 813 , 81 S.Ct . 60 , 5 L.Ed.2d 45 . We affirm the judgment .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Allbright - Nell manufactured the alleged infringing device , a machine for cutting sausage meat , known as the ' ANCO Emulsitator . ' It sold some of the devices to Eckrich , whose principal place of business was at Fort Wayne , Indiana . In the contract of sale , Allbright - Nell agreed to defend any infringement suits which might be filed against Eckrich involving the device and to bear all of the expense thereof , including any recovery . While Eckrich was using the machines , petitioners sued it in Indiana for infringement . 3 Pursuant to its contract , Allbright - Nell employed attorneys who defended the suit in the name of Eckrich . Thereafter , before any judgment was entered , petitioners amended their complaint , naming Allbright - Nell as a party defendant . Service was made upon Allbright - Nell by serving its president in Illinois . Motions to quash ( on the ground that such service was made outside of the jurisdiction of the court ) and to dismiss ( on the ground that venue under § 1400(b ) was improper ) were promptly filed . The petitioners admit that this service conferred no jurisdiction on the court and also concede that Allbright - Nell had no place of business in Indiana and , therefore , under § 1400(b ) , venue as to it could not lie in Indiana . However , they urge that the presence of Allbright - Nell through the attorneys , openly defending and controlling the suit against Eckrich , gave the court jurisdiction over the former . 4 In effect , petitioners argue , Allbright - Nell was in fact before the court protecting its own interests , was acting only as a ' puppeteer ' of Eckrich , and was seeking all the benefits of litigation but attempting to avoid all of its responsibilities , save the ultimate application of res judicata . It , therefore , should be deemed to have entered a general appearance and waived its objection to venue . In the face of § 1400(b ) , however , we think not .	@@empty@@	unmatched
While objection to venue ' may be lost by failure to assert it seasonably , by formal submission in a cause , or by submission through conduct , * * * courts affix to conduct ( such ) consequences as to place of suit consistent with the policy behind ' the applicable venue statute . Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp. , 308 U.S. 165 , 168 , 60 S.Ct . 153 , 155 , 84 L.Ed . 167 . As is pointed out in the cases , Congress adopted the predecessor to § 1400(b ) as a special venue statute in patent infringement actions to eliminate the ' abuses engendered ' by previous venue provisions allowing such suits to be brought in any district in which the defendant could be served . Stonite Products Co. v. Melvin Lloyd Co. , 315 U.S. 561 , 62 S.Ct . 780 , 86 L.Ed . 1026 . The Act was designed ' to define the exact jurisdiction of the * * * courts in these matters , ' 315 U.S. at page 565 , note 5 , 62 S.Ct . at page 782 , and not to ' dovetail with the general ( venue ) provisions . ' Id. , 315 U.S. 566 , 62 S.Ct . 782 . As late as 1957 we have held § 1400(b ) to be ' the sole and exclusive provision controlling venue in patent infringements actions . ' Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra Products Corp. , 1957 , 353 U.S. 222 , 229 , 77 S.Ct . 787 , 792 , 1 L.Ed.2d 786 . The language of this special statute is clear and specific . The practice complained of here was not at all unusual at the time of this statute 's passage , 5 and for us to enlarge upon the mandate of the Congress as to venue in such patent actions would be an intrusion into the legislative field .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In fact , the petitioners would have us do now what this Court specifically refused to do 45 years ago in Merriam Co. v. Saalfield , 1916 , 241 U.S. 22 , 36 S.Ct . 477 , 60 L.Ed . 868 . There the entire defense of the named defendant ( Saalfield ) was openly financed and controlled by one Ogilvie , as to whom venue was improper ; Merriam sought by supplemental bill to make Ogilvie a defendant before a final judgment was rendered , but after the issue of unfair competition ahd been decided ; and Ogilvie would have been bound by the final judgment under res judicata . Nevertheless , his seasonable motion to quash the substituted service had upon the attorneys defending Saalfield was sustained . We believe the holding in Merriam completely supports our conclusion here . If a general appearance could be found in such conduct , the facts there were stronger , for the proceedings against Saalfield , handled entirely by Ogilvie , had progressed to the appointment of a master to determine the amount of damages . All that remained when it was sought to join Ogilvie was an accounting . Yet a unanimous Court sustained the dismissal , saying :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' ( I)f the decree ( of injunction and accounting ) * * * was not final as between appellant ( Merriam Co. ) and Saalfield , it can not be res judicata as against Ogilvie ; and thus the fundamental ground for proceeding against the latter by * * * substituted service of process disappears . This sufficiently shows the weakness of appellant 's position , which , upon analysis , is found to be this : that upon the theory that Ogilvie would be estopped by a final decree if and when made , it sought to bring him into the suit , before final decree , as if he were already estopped . However convenient this might be to a complainant in appellant 's position , it is inconsistent with elementary principles . ' 241 U.S. at pages 2829 , 36 S.Ct . at page 480 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Petitioners stress that here the conduct of Allbright - Nell continued after it was named a party . We are not persuaded that this has any bearing upon the issue to be decided . The conduct which will amount to a waiver of venue is that of the defendant alone and nothing a plaintiff might do can change the legal consequences which attach to that conduct . Cf . Olberding v. Illinois Central R. Co. , 346 U.S. 338 , 74 S.Ct . 83 , 98 L.Ed . 39 . Certainly the point in time at which petitioners sought to join Allbright - Nell will control the amount of its total activities which will be considered in determining whether venue has been waived ; but this can not alter the conclusions to be drawn from that conduct . Therefore , whether Allbright - Nell 's actions took place before or after being named a party is immaterial to the question of waiver under the special venue provisions of § 1400(b ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Petitioners insist that this result exalts form over substance . We think not .

Petitioner Gall joined an ongoing enterprise distributing the controlled substance ecstasy while in college , but withdrew from the conspiracy after seven months , has sold no illegal drugs since , and has used no illegal drugs and worked steadily since graduation . Three and half years after withdrawing from the conspiracy , Gall pleaded guilty to his participation . A presentence report recommended a sentence of 30 to 37 months in prison , but the District Court sentenced Gall to 36 months probation , finding that probation reflected the seriousness of his offense and that imprisonment was unnecessary because his voluntary withdrawal from the conspiracy and postoffense conduct showed that he would not return to criminal behavior and was not a danger to society . The Eighth Circuit reversed on the ground that a sentence outside the Federal Sentencing Guidelines range must beand was not in this casesupported by extraordinary circumstances .	@@empty@@	unmatched
( a ) Because the Guidelines are now advisory , appellate review of sentencing decisions is limited to determining whether they are reasonable, United States v. Booker , 543 U. S. 220 , and an abuse - of - discretion standard applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions . A district judge must consider the extent of any departure from the Guidelines and must explain the appropriateness of an unusually lenient or harsh sentence with sufficient justifications . An appellate court may take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines , but it may not require extraordinary circumstances or employ a rigid mathematical formula using a departures percentage as the standard for determining the strength of the justification required for a specific sentence . Such approaches come too close to creating an impermissible unreasonableness presumption for sentences outside the Guidelines range . The mathematical approach also suffers from infirmities of application . And both approaches reflect a practice of applying a heightened standard of review to sentences outside the Guidelines range , which is inconsistent with the rule that the abuse - of - discretion standard applies to appellate review of all sentencing decisionswhether inside or outside that range .

( b ) A district court should begin by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range . The Guidelines are the starting point and initial benchmark but are not the only consideration . After permitting both parties to argue for a particular sentence , the judge should consider all of 18 U. S. C. § 3353(a)s factors to determine whether they support either partys proposal . He may not presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable but must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented . If he decides on an outside - the - Guidelines sentence , he must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of variation . He must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing . In reviewing the sentence , the appellate court must first ensure that the district court made no significant procedural errors and then consider the sentences substantive reasonableness under an abuse - of - discretion standard , taking into account the totality of the circumstances , including the extent of a variance from the Guidelines range , but must give due deference to the district courts decision that the § 3553(a ) factors justify the variance . That the appellate court might have reasonably reached a different conclusion does not justify reversal . Pp . 1114 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
2 . On abuse - of - discretion review , the Eighth Circuit failed to give due deference to the District Courts reasoned and reasonable sentencing decision . Since the District Court committed no procedural error , the only question for the Circuit was whether the sentence was reasonable , i.e. , whether the District Judge abused his discretion in determining that the § 3553(a ) factors supported the sentence and justified a substantial deviation from the Guidelines range . The Circuit gave virtually no deference to the District Courts decision that the variance was justified . The Circuit clearly disagreed with the District Courts decision , but it was not for the Circuit to decide de novo whether the justification for a variance is sufficient or the sentence reasonable .

In two cases argued on the same day last Term we considered the standard that courts of appeals should apply when reviewing the reasonableness of sentences imposed by district judges . The first , Rita v. United States , 551 U. S. _ _ _ ( 2007 ) , involved a sentence within the range recommended by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines ; we held that when a district judges discretionary decision in a particular case accords with the sentence the United States Sentencing Commission deems appropriate in the mine run of cases, the court of appeals may presume that the sentence is reasonable .

The second case , Claiborne v. United States , involved a sentence below the range recommended by the Guidelines , and raised the converse question whether a court of appeals may apply a proportionality test, and require that a sentence that constitutes a substantial variance from the Guidelines be justified by extraordinary circumstances . See Claiborne v. United States , 549 U. S. _ _ _ ( 2006 ) . We did not have the opportunity to answer this question because the case was mooted by Claibornes untimely death . Claiborne v. United States , 551 U. S. _ _ _ ( 2007 ) ( per curiam ) . We granted certiorari in the case before us today in order to reach that question , left unanswered last Term . 551 U. S. _ _ _ ( 2007 ) . We now hold that , while the extent of the difference between a particular sentence and the recommended Guidelines range is surely relevant , courts of appeals must review all sentenceswhether inside , just outside , or significantly outside the Guidelines rangeunder a deferential abuse - of - discretion standard . We also hold that the sentence imposed by the experienced District Judge in this case was reasonable .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In February or March 2000 , petitioner Brian Gall , a second - year college student at the University of Iowa , was invited by Luke Rinderknecht to join an ongoing enterprise distributing a controlled substance popularly known as ecstasy. 1 Gallwho was then a user of ecstasy , cocaine , and marijuanaaccepted the invitation . During the ensuing seven months , Gall delivered ecstasy pills , which he received from Rinderknecht , to other conspirators , who then sold them to consumers . He netted over $ 30,000 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A month or two after joining the conspiracy , Gall stopped using ecstasy . A few months after that , in September 2000 , he advised Rinderknecht and other co - conspirators that he was withdrawing from the conspiracy . He has not sold illegal drugs of any kind since . He has , in the words of the District Court , self - rehabilitated. App . 75 . He graduated from the University of Iowa in 2002 , and moved first to Arizona , where he obtained a job in the construction industry , and later to Colorado , where he earned $ 18 per hour as a master carpenter . He has not used any illegal drugs since graduating from college .	@@empty@@	unmatched
After Gall moved to Arizona , he was approached by federal law enforcement agents who questioned him about his involvement in the ecstasy distribution conspiracy . Gall admitted his limited participation in the distribution of ecstasy , and the agents took no further action at that time . On April 28 , 2004approximately a year and a half after this initial interview , and three and a half years after Gall withdrew from the conspiracyan indictment was returned in the Southern District of Iowa charging him and seven other defendants with participating in a conspiracy to distribute ecstasy , cocaine , and marijuana , that began in or about May 1996 and continued through October 30 , 2002 . The Government has never questioned the truthfulness of any of Galls earlier statements or contended that he played any role in , or had any knowledge of , other aspects of the conspiracy described in the indictment . When he received notice of the indictment , Gall moved back to Iowa and surrendered to the authorities . While free on his own recognizance , Gall started his own business in the construction industry , primarily engaged in subcontracting for the installation of windows and doors . In his first year , his profits were over $ 2,000 per month .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Gall entered into a plea agreement with the Government , stipulating that he was responsible for , but did not necessarily distribute himself , at least 2,500 grams of [ ecstasy ] , or the equivalent of at least 87.5 kilograms of marijuana. Id. , at 25 . In the agreement , the Government acknowledged that by on or about September of 2000, Gall had communicated his intent to stop distributing ecstasy to Rinderknecht and other members of the conspiracy . Ibid . The agreement further provided that recent changes in the Guidelines that enhanced the recommended punishment for distributing ecstasy were not applicable to Gall because he had withdrawn from the conspiracy prior to the effective date of those changes .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In her presentence report , the probation officer concluded that Gall had no significant criminal history ; that he was not an organizer , leader , or manager ; and that his offense did not involve the use of any weapons . The report stated that Gall had truthfully provided the Government with all of the evidence he had concerning the alleged offenses , but that his evidence was not useful because he provided no new information to the agents . The report also described Galls substantial use of drugs prior to his offense and the absence of any such use in recent years . The report recommended a sentencing range of 30 to 37 months of imprisonment .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The record of the sentencing hearing held on May 27 , 2005 , includes a small flood of letters from Galls parents and other relatives , his fiance , neighbors , and representatives of firms doing business with him , uniformly praising his character and work ethic . The transcript includes the testimony of several witnesses and the District Judges colloquy with the Assistant United States Attorney ( AUSA ) and with Gall . The AUSA did not contest any of the evidence concerning Galls law - abiding life during the preceding five years , but urged that the Guidelines are appropriate and should be followed, and requested that the court impose a prison sentence within the Guidelines range . Id. , at 93 . He mentioned that two of Galls co - conspirators had been sentenced to 30 and 35 months , respectively , but upon further questioning by the District Court , he acknowledged that neither of them had voluntarily withdrawn from the conspiracy .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This case concerns the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial in capital prosecutions . In Arizona , following a jury adjudication of a defendants guilt of first - degree murder , the trial judge , sitting alone , determines the presence or absence of the aggravating factors required by Arizona law for imposition of the death penalty .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
In Walton v. Arizona , 497 U. S. 639 ( 1990 ) , this Court held that Arizonas sentencing scheme was compatible with the Sixth Amendment because the additional facts found by the judge qualified as sentencing considerations , not as element[s ] of the offense of capital murder. Id. , at 649 . Ten years later , however , we decided Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U. S. 466 ( 2000 ) , which held that the Sixth Amendment does not permit a defendant to be expose[d ] … to a penalty exceeding the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone. Id. , at 483 . This prescription governs , Apprendi determined , even if the State characterizes the additional findings made by the judge as sentencing factor[s]. Id. , at 492 .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
Apprendi s reasoning is irreconcilable with Walton s holding in this regard , and today we overrule Walton in relevant part . Capital defendants , no less than non - capital defendants , we conclude , are entitled to a jury determination of any fact on which the legislature conditions an increase in their maximum punishment .	@@empty@@	unmatched
At the trial of petitioner Timothy Ring for murder , armed robbery , and related charges , the prosecutor presented evidence sufficient to permit the jury to find the facts here recounted . On November 28 , 1994 , a Wells Fargo armored van pulled up to the Dillards department store at Arrowhead Mall in Glendale , Arizona . Tr . 57 , 6061 ( Nov. 14 , 1996 ) .

Later that day , Maricopa County Sheriffs Deputies found the vanits doors locked and its engine runningin the parking lot of a church in Sun City , Arizona . Id. , at 99100 ( Nov. 13 , 1996 ) . Inside the vehicle they found Magoch , dead from a single gunshot to the head . Id. , at 101 .

Prompted by an informants tip , Glendale police sought to determine whether Ring and his friend James Greenham were involved in the robbery .

E.g. , i d . , at 153156 ( Nov. 14 , 1996 ) ; i d . , at 9094 ( Nov. 21 , 1996 ) . Wiretaps were then placed on the telephones of Ring , Greenham , and a third suspect , William Ferguson . Id. , at 1921 ( Nov. 18 , 1996 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In one recorded phone conversation , Ring told Ferguson that Ring might cu[t ] off Greenham because [h]es too much of a risk : Greenham had indiscreetly flaunted a new truck in front of his ex - wife . States Exh . 49A , pp . 1112 . Ring said he could cut off his associate because he held both [ Greenhams ] and mine. Id. , at 11 . The police engineered a local news broadcast about the robbery investigation ; they included in the account several intentional inaccuracies . Tr . 35 , 1314 ( Nov. 19 , 1996 ) . On hearing the broadcast report , Ring left a message on Greenhams answering machine to remind me to talk to you tomorrow and tell you about what was on the news tonight . Very important , and also fairly good. States Exh . 55A , p. 2 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
After a detective left a note on Greenhams door asking him to call , Tr . 115118 ( Nov. 18 , 1996 ) , Ring told Ferguson that he was puzzled by the attention the police trained on Greenham . [H]is house is clean, Ring said ; [m]ine , on the other hand , contains a very large bag. States Exh . 70A , p. 7 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On February 14 , 1995 , police furnished a staged reenactment of the robbery to the local news , and again included deliberate inaccuracies . Tr . 5 ( Nov. 19 , 1996 ) .

Two days later , the police executed a search warrant at Rings house , discovering a duffel bag in his garage containing more than $ 271,000 in cash . Tr . 107108 , 111 , 125 ( Nov. 20 , 1996 ) . They also found a note with the number 575,995 on it , followed by the word splits and the letters F, Y, and T. Id. , at 127130 .

Testifying in his own defense , Ring said the money seized at his house was startup capital for a construction company he and Greenham were planning to form . Id. , at 1011 ( Dec. 3 , 1996 ) .

Id. , at 162 , 166167 , 180 ( Dec. 2 , 1996 ) . But an FBI agent testified that Ring had been paid only $ 458 , i d . , at 47 ( Nov. 20 , 1996 ) , and other evidence showed that Ring had made no more than $ 8,800 as a bail bondsman , i d . , at 4851 ( Nov. 21 , 1996 ) ; i d . , at 21 ( Nov. 25 , 1996 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The trial judge instructed the jury on alternative charges of premeditated murder and felony murder . The jury deadlocked on premeditated murder , with 6 of 12 jurors voting to acquit , but convicted Ring of felony murder occurring in the course of armed robbery . See Ariz. Rev. Stat . Ann . § 131105(A ) and ( B ) ( West 2001 ) ( A person commits first degree murder if … [ a]cting either alone or with one or more other persons the person commits or attempts to commit … [ one of several enumerated felonies ] … and in the course of and in furtherance of the offense or immediate flight from the offense , the person or another person causes the death of any person . … Homicide , as prescribed in [ this provision ] requires no specific mental state other than what is required for the commission of any of the enumerated felonies. ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
As later summed up by the Arizona Supreme Court , the evidence admitted at trial failed to prove , beyond a reasonable doubt , that [ Ring ] was a major participant in the armed robbery or that he actually murdered Magoch. 200 Ariz. 267 , 280 , 25 P. 3d 1139 , 1152 ( 2001 ) . Although clear evidence connected Ring to the robberys proceeds , nothing submitted at trial put him at the scene of the robbery . See ibid . Furthermore , [f]or all we know from the trial evidence, the Arizona court stated , [Ring ] did not participate in , plan , or even expect the killing . This lack of evidence no doubt explains why the jury found [ Ring ] guilty of felony , but not premeditated , murder. Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Under Arizona law , Ring could not be sentenced to death , the statutory maximum penalty for first - degree murder , unless further findings were made . The States first - degree murder statute prescribes that the offense is punishable by death or life imprisonment as provided by § 13703. Ariz. Rev. Stat . Ann . § 131105(C ) ( West 2001 ) . The cross - referenced section , § 13703 , directs the judge who presided at trial to conduct a separate sentencing hearing to determine the existence or nonexistence of [ certain enumerated ] circumstances … for the purpose of determining the sentence to be imposed. § 13703(C ) ( West Supp . 2001 ) .

The court alone shall make all factual determinations required by this section or the constitution of the United States or this state. Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing , the judge is to determine the presence or absence of the enumerated aggravating circumstances 1 and any mitigating circumstances. 2 The States law authorizes the judge to sentence the defendant to death only if there is at least one aggravating circumstance and there are no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call for leniency. § 13703(F ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Between Rings trial and sentencing hearing , Greenham pleaded guilty to second - degree murder and armed robbery . He stipulated to a 27½ year sentence and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution in the cases against Ring and Ferguson . Tr . 3537 ( Oct. 9 , 1997 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Called by the prosecution at Rings sentencing hearing , Greenham testified that he , Ring , and Ferguson had been planning the robbery for several weeks before it occurred . According to Greenham , Ring had I guess taken the role as leader because he laid out all the tactics. Id. , at 39 . On the day of the robbery , Greenham said , the three watched the armored van pull up to the mall . Id. , at 45 . When Magoch opened the door to smoke a cigarette , Ring shot him with a rifle equipped with a homemade silencer . Id. , at 42 , 4445 . Greenham then pushed Magochs body aside and drove the van away . Id. , at 45 . At Rings direction , Greenham drove to the church parking lot , where he and Ring transferred the money to Rings truck . Id. , at 46 , 48 . Later , Greenham recalled , as the three robbers were dividing up the money , Ring upbraided him and Ferguson for forgetting to congratulate [ Ring ] on [ his ] shot. Id. , at 60 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On October 29 , 1997 , the trial judge entered his Special Verdict sentencing Ring to death . Because Ring was convicted of felony murder , not premeditated murder , the judge recognized that Ring was eligible for the death penalty only if he was Magochs actual killer or if he was a major participant in the armed robbery that led to the killing and exhibited a reckless disregard or indifference for human life. App . to Pet . for Cert . 46a47a ; see Enmund v. Florida , 458 U. S. 782 ( 1982 ) ( Eighth Amendment requires finding that felony - murder defendant killed or attempted to kill ) ; Tison v. Arizona , 481 U. S. 137 , 158 ( 1987 ) ( qualifying Enmund , and holding that Eighth Amendment permits execution of felony - murder defendant , who did not kill or attempt to kill , but who was a major participa[nt ] in the felony committed and who demonstrated reckless indifference to human life ) .	Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted .	35
Citing Greenhams testimony at the sentencing hearing , the judge concluded that Ring is the one who shot and killed Mr. Magoch. App . to Pet . for Cert . 47a . The judge also found that Ring was a major participant in the robbery and that armed robbery is unquestionably a crime which carries with it a grave risk of death. Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The judge then turned to the determination of aggravating and mitigating circumstances . See § 13703 . He found two aggravating factors . First , the judge determined that Ring committed the offense in expectation of receiving something of pecuniary value, as described in § 13703 ; [t]aking the cash from the armored car was the motive and reason for Mr. Magochs murder and not just the result. App . to Pet . for Cert . 49a . Second , the judge found that the offense was committed in an especially heinous , cruel or depraved manner. Ibid . In support of this finding , he cited Rings comment , as reported by Greenham at the sentencing hearing , expressing pride in his marksmanship . Id. , at 49a50a . The judge found one nonstatutory mitigating factor : Rings minimal criminal record . Id. , at 52a . In his judgment , that mitigating circumstance did not call for leniency ; he therefore sentenced Ring to death . Id. , at 53a .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On appeal , Ring argued that Arizonas capital sentencing scheme violates the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U. S. Constitution because it entrusts to a judge the finding of a fact raising the defendants maximum penalty . See Jones v. United States , 526 U. S. 227 ( 1999 ) ; Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U. S. 466 ( 2000 ) . The State , in response , noted that this Court had upheld Arizonas system in Walton v. Arizona , 497 U. S. 639 ( 1990 ) , and had stated in Apprendi that Walton remained good law .	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws .

But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state .

Reviewing the death sentence , the Arizona Supreme Court made two preliminary observations . Apprendi and Jones , the Arizona high court said , raise some question about the continued viability of Walton . 200 Ariz. , at 278 , 25 P. 3d , at 1150 . The court then examined the Apprendi majoritys interpretation of Arizona law and found it wanting . Apprendi , the Arizona court noted , described Arizonas sentencing system as one that  requir[es ] judges , after a jury verdict holding a defendant guilty of a capital crime , to find specific aggravating factors before imposing a sentence of death, and not as a system that permits a judge to determine the existence of a factor which makes a crime a capital offense.  200 Ariz. , at 279 , 25 P. 3d , at 1151 ( quoting Apprendi , 530 U. S. , at 496497 ) . Justice OConnor s Apprendi dissent , the Arizona court noted , squarely rejected the Apprendi majoritys characterization of the Arizona sentencing scheme : A defendant convicted of first - degree murder in Arizona can not receive a death sentence unless a judge makes the factual determination that a statutory aggravating factor exists . Without that critical finding , the maximum sentence to which the defendant is exposed is life imprisonment , and not the death penalty. 200 Ariz. , at 279 , 25 P. 3d , at 1151 ( quoting Apprendi , 530 U. S. , at 538 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
After reciting this Courts divergent constructions of Arizona law in Apprendi , the Arizona Supreme Court described how capital sentencing in fact works in the State . The Arizona high court concluded that the present case is precisely as described in Justice OConnors dissent [ in Apprendi ] Defendants death sentence required the judges factual findings. 200 Ariz. , at 279 , 25 P. 3d , at 1151 . Although it agreed with the Apprendi dissents reading of Arizona law , the Arizona court understood that it was bound by the Supremacy Clause to apply Walton , which this Court had not overruled . It therefore rejected Rings constitutional attack on the States capital murder judicial sentencing system . 200 Ariz. , at 280 , 25 P. 3d , at 1152 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The court agreed with Ring that the evidence was insufficient to support the aggravating circumstance of depravity , i d . , at 281282 , 25 P. 3d , at 11531154 , but it upheld the trial courts finding on the aggravating factor of pecuniary gain . The Arizona Supreme Court then reweighed that remaining factor against the sole mitigating circumstance ( Rings lack of a serious criminal record ) , and affirmed the death sentence . Id. , at 282284 , 25 P. 3d , at 11541156 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We granted Rings petition for a writ of certiorari , 534 U. S. 1103 ( 2002 ) , to allay uncertainty in the lower courts caused by the manifest tension between Walton and the reasoning of Apprendi . See , e.g. , United States v. Promise , 255 F. 3d 150 , 159160 ( CA4 2001 ) ( en banc ) ( calling the continued authority of Walton in light of Apprendi perplexing ) ; Hoffman v. Arave , 236 F. 3d 523 , 542 ( CA9 2001 ) (  Apprendi may raise some doubt about Walton . ) ; People v. Kaczmarek , 318 Ill. App . 3d 340 , 351352 , 741 N. E. 2d 1131 , 1142 ( 2000 ) ( [W]hile it appears Apprendi extends greater constitutional protections to noncapital , rather than capital , defendants , the Court has endorsed this precise principle , and we are in no position to secondguess that decision here. ) . We now reverse the judgment of the Arizona Supreme Court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Based solely on the jurys verdict finding Ring guilty of first - degree felony murder , the maximum punishment he could have received was life imprisonment . See 200 Ariz. , at 279 , 25 P. 3d , at 1151 ( citing Ariz. Rev. Stat . § 13703 ) . This was so because , in Arizona , a death sentence may not legally be imposed … unless at least one aggravating factor is found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt. 200 Ariz. , at 279 , 25 P. 3d , at 1151 ( citing § 13703 ) . The question presented is whether that aggravating factor may be found by the judge , as Arizona law specifies , or whether the Sixth Amendments jury trial guarantee , 3 made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment , requires that the aggravating factor determination be entrusted to the jury . 4	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27

As earlier indicated , see supra , at 1 , 89 , this is not the first time we have considered the constitutionality of Arizonas capital sentencing system . In Walton v. Arizona , 497 U. S. 639 ( 1990 ) , we upheld Arizonas scheme against a charge that it violated the Sixth Amendment . The Court had previously denied a Sixth Amendment challenge to Floridas capital sentencing system , in which the jury recommends a sentence but makes no explicit findings on aggravating circumstances ; we so ruled , Walton noted , on the ground that the Sixth Amendment does not require that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of the sentence of death be made by the jury. Id. , at 648 ( quoting Hildwin v. Florida , 490 U. S. 638 , 640641 ( 1989 ) ( per curiam ) ) . Walton found unavailing the attempts by the defendant - petitioner in that case to distinguish Floridas capital sentencing system from Arizonas . In neither State , according to Walton , were the aggravating factors elements of the offense ; in both States , they ranked as sentencing considerations guiding the choice between life and death . 497 U. S. , at 648 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
Walton drew support from Cabana v. Bullock , 474 U. S. 376 ( 1986 ) , in which the Court held there was no constitutional bar to an appellate courts finding that a defendant killed , attempted to kill , or intended to kill , as Enmund v. Florida , 458 U. S. 782 ( 1982 ) , required for imposition of the death penalty in felony - murder cases . The Enmund finding could be made by a court , Walton maintained , because it entailed no  element of the crime of capital murder  ; it only place[d ] a substantive limitation on sentencing.  497 U. S. , at 649 ( quoting Cabana , 474 U. S. , at 385386 ) . If the Constitution does not require that the Enmund finding be proved as an element of the offense of capital murder , and does not require a jury to make that finding, Walton stated , we can not conclude that a State is required to denominate aggravating circumstances elements of the offense or permit only a jury to determine the existence of such circumstances. 497 U. S. , at 649 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In dissent in Walton , Justice Stevens urged that the Sixth Amendment requires a jury determination of facts that must be established before the death penalty may be imposed. Id. , at 709 . Aggravators operate as statutory elements of capital murder under Arizona law, he reasoned , because in their absence , [ the death ] sentence is unavailable. Id. , at 709 , n. 1 . If th[e ] question had been posed in 1791 , when the Sixth Amendment became law, Justice Stevens said , the answer would have been clear, for [b]y that time ,	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
the English jurys role in determining critical facts in homicide cases was entrenched . As fact - finder , the jury had the power to determine not only whether the defendant was guilty of homicide but also the degree of the offense . Moreover , the jurys role in finding facts that would determine a homicide defendants eligibility for capital punishment was particularly well established . Throughout its history , the jury determined which homicide defendants would be subject to capital punishment by making factual determinations , many of which related to difficult assessments of the defendants state of mind . By the time the Bill of Rights was adopted , the jurys right to make these determinations was unquestioned. Id. , at 710711 ( quoting White , Fact - Finding and the Death Penalty : The Scope of a Capital Defendants Right to Jury Trial , 65 Notre Dame L.

Walton was revisited in Jones v. United States , 526 U. S. 227 ( 1999 ) . In that case , we construed the federal carjacking statute , 18 U. S. C. § 2119 ( 1994 ed . and Supp . V ) , which , at the time of the criminal conduct at issue , provided that a person possessing a firearm who takes a motor vehicle … from the person or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation … shall(1 ) be … imprisoned not more than 15 years … , ( 2 ) if serious bodily injury … results , be … imprisoned not more than 25 years … , and ( 3 ) if death results , be … imprisoned for any number of years up to life … . The question presented in Jones was whether the statute defined three distinct offenses or a single crime with a choice of three maximum penalties , two of them dependent on sentencing factors exempt from the requirements of charge and jury verdict. 526 U. S. , at 229 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The carjacking statute , we recognized , was susceptible of [ both ] constructions ; we adopted the one that avoided grave and doubtful constitutional questions. Id. , at 239 ( quoting United States ex rel . Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co. , 213 U. S. 366 , 408 ( 1909 ) ) . Section 2119 , we held , established three separate offenses . Therefore , the factscausation of serious bodily injury or deathnecessary to trigger the escalating maximum penalties fell within the jurys province to decide . See Jones , 526 U. S. , at 251252 . Responding to the dissenting opinion , the Jones Court restated succinctly the principle animating its view that the carjacking statute , if read to define a single crime , might violate the Constitution : [U]nder the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment , any fact ( other than prior conviction ) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment , submitted to a jury , and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. , at 243 , n. 6 .	No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia , when in actual service in time of war or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation .	54

Jones endeavored to distinguish certain capital sentencing decisions , including Walton . Advancing a careful reading of Walton s rationale, the Jones Court said : Walton characterized the finding of aggravating facts falling within the traditional scope of capital sentencing as a choice between a greater and a lesser penalty , not as a process of raising the ceiling of the sentencing range available. 526 U. S. , at 251 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Dissenting in Jones , Justice Kennedy questioned the Courts account of Walton . The aggravating factors at issue in Walton , he suggested , were not merely circumstances for consideration by the trial judge in exercising sentencing discretion within a statutory range of penalties . Under the relevant Arizona statute, Justice Kennedy observed , Walton could not have been sentenced to death unless the trial judge found at least one of the enumerated aggravating factors . Absent such a finding , the maximum potential punishment provided by law was a term of imprisonment. 526 U. S. , at 272 ( cita- tion omitted ) . Jones , Justice Kennedy concluded , cast doubtneedlessly in his viewon the vitality of Walton :	@@empty@@	unmatched
If it is constitutionally impermissible to allow a judges finding to increase the maximum punishment for carjacking by 10 years , it is not clear why a judges finding may increase the maximum punishment for murder from imprisonment to death . In fact , Walton would appear to have been a better candidate for the Courts new approach than is the instant case. 526 U. S. , at 272 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
One year after Jones , the Court decided Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U. S. 466 ( 2000 ) . The defendant - petitioner in that case was convicted of , inter alia , second - degree possession of a firearm , an offense carrying a maximum penalty of ten years under New Jersey law . See i d . , at 469470 . On the prosecutors motion , the sentencing judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that Apprendis crime had been motivated by racial animus . That finding triggered application of New Jerseys hate crime enhancement, which doubled Apprendis maximum authorized sentence . The judge sentenced Apprendi to 12 years in prison , 2 years over the maximum that would have applied but for the enhancement .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We held that Apprendis sentence violated his right to a jury determination that [ he ] is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged , beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. , at 477 ( quoting United States v. Gaudin , 515 U. S. 506 , 510 ( 1995 ) ) . That right attached not only to Apprendis weapons offense but also to the hate crime aggravating circumstance . New Jersey , the Court observed , threatened Apprendi with certain pains if he unlawfully possessed a weapon and with additional pains if he selected his victims with a purpose to intimidate them because of their race. Apprendi , 530 U. S. , at 476 . Merely using the label sentence enhancement to describe the [ second act ] surely does not provide a principled basis for treating [ the two acts ] differently. Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The dispositive question , we said , is one not of form , but of effect. Id. , at 494 . If a State makes an increase in a defendants authorized punishment contingent on the finding of a fact , that factno matter how the State labels itmust be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt . See i d . , at 482483 . A defendant may not be expose[d ] … to a penalty exceeding the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone. Id. , at 483 ; see also i d . , at 499 ( Scalia , J. , concurring ) ( [A]ll the facts which must exist in order to subject the defendant to a legally prescribed punishment must be found by the jury. ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Walton could be reconciled with Apprendi , the Court finally asserted . The key distinction , according to the Apprendi Court , was that a conviction of first - degree murder in Arizona carried a maximum sentence of death . [O]nce a jury has found the defendant guilty of all the elements of an offense which carries as its maximum penalty the sentence of death , it may be left to the judge to decide whether that maximum penalty , rather than a lesser one , ought to be imposed. 530 U. S. , at 497 ( emphasis deleted ) ( quoting Almendarez - Torres v. United States , 523 U. S. 224 , 257 , n. 2 ( 1998 ) ( Scalia , J. , dissenting ) ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Apprendi dissenters called the Courts distinction of Walton baffling. 530 U. S. , at 538 ( opinion of OConnor , J. ) . The Court claimed that the jury makes all of the findings necessary to expose the defendant to a death sentence. Ibid . That , the dissent said , was demonstrably untrue, for a defendant convicted of first - degree murder in Arizona can not receive a death sentence unless a judge makes the factual determination that a statutory aggravating factor exists . Without that critical finding , the maximum sentence to which the defendant is exposed is life imprisonment , and not the death penalty. Ibid . Walton , the Apprendi dissenters insisted , if properly followed , would have required the Court to uphold Apprendis sentence . If a State can remove from the jury a factual determination that makes the difference between life and death , as Walton holds that it can , it is inconceivable why a State can not do the same with respect to a factual determination that results in only a 10-year increase in the maximum sentence to which a defendant is exposed. 530 U. S. , at 537 ( opinion of OConnor , J. ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Arizona Supreme Court , as we earlier recounted , see supra , at 89 , found the Apprendi majoritys portrayal of Arizonas capital sentencing law incorrect , and the description in Justice OConnor s dissent precisely right : Defendants death sentence required the judges factual findings. 200 Ariz. , at 279 , 25 P. 3d , at 1151 . Recognizing that the Arizona courts construction of the States own law is authoritative , see Mullaney v. Wilbur , 421 U. S. 684 , 691 ( 1975 ) , we are persuaded that Walton , in relevant part , can not survive the reasoning of Apprendi .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In an effort to reconcile its capital sentencing system with the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by Apprendi , Arizona first restates the Apprendi majoritys portrayal of Arizonas system : Ring was convicted of first - degree murder , for which Arizona law specifies death or life imprisonment as the only sentencing options , see Ariz. Rev. Stat . Ann . § 131105(C ) ( West 2001 ) ; Ring was therefore sentenced within the range of punishment authorized by the jury verdict . See Brief for Respondent 919 . This argument overlooks Apprendi s instruction that the relevant inquiry is one not of form , but of effect. 530 U. S. , at 494 . In effect , the required finding [ of an aggravated circumstance ] expose[d ] [ Ring ] to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jurys guilty verdict. Ibid . ; see 200 Ariz. , at 279 , 25 P. 3d , at 1151 . The Arizona first - degree murder statute authorizes a maximum penalty of death only in a formal sense, Apprendi , 530 U. S. , at 541 ( OConnor , J. , dissenting ) , for it explicitly cross - references the statutory provision requiring the finding of an aggravating circumstance before imposition of the death penalty . See § 131105(C ) ( First degree murder is a class 1 felony and is punishable by death or life imprisonment as provided by § 13703 . ( emphasis added ) ) . If Arizona prevailed on its opening argument , Apprendi would be reduced to a meaningless and formalistic rule of statutory drafting . See 530 U. S. , at 541 ( OConnor , J. , dissenting ) .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
Arizona also supports the distinction relied upon in Walton between elements of an offense and sentencing factors . See supra , at 1112 ; Tr . of Oral Arg . 2829 . As to elevation of the maximum punishment , however , Apprendi renders the argument untenable ; 5 Apprendi repeatedly instructs in that context that the characterization of a fact or circumstance as an element or a sentencing factor is not determinative of the question who decides, judge or jury . See , e.g. , 530 U. S. , at 492 ( noting New Jerseys contention that [t]he required finding of biased purpose is not an element of a distinct hate crime offense , but rather the traditional sentencing factor of motive, and calling this argument nothing more than a disagreement with the rule we apply today ) ; i d . , at 494 , n. 19 ( [W]hen the term sentence enhancement is used to describe an increase beyond the maximum authorized statutory sentence , it is the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense than the one covered by the jurys guilty verdict. ) ; i d . , at 495 ( [M]erely because the state legislature placed its hate crime sentence enhancer within the sentencing provisions of the criminal code does not mean that the finding of a biased purpose to intimidate is not an essential element of the offense. ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) ; see also i d . , at 501 ( Thomas , J. , concurring ) ( [I]f the legislature defines some core crime and then provides for increasing the punishment of that crime upon a finding of some aggravating fact [ , ] … the core crime and the aggravating fact together constitute an aggravated crime , just as much as grand larceny is an aggravated form of petit larceny . The aggravating fact is an element of the aggravated crime. ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Even if facts increasing punishment beyond the maximum authorized by a guilty verdict standing alone ordinarily must be found by a jury , Arizona further urges , aggravating circumstances necessary to trigger a death sentence may nonetheless be reserved for judicial determination . As Arizonas counsel maintained at oral argument , there is no doubt that [d]eath is different. Tr . of Oral Arg . 43 . States have constructed elaborate sentencing procedures in death cases , Arizona emphasizes , because of constraints we have said the Eighth Amendment places on capital sentencing . Brief for Respondent 2125 ( citing Furman v. Georgia , 408 U. S. 238 ( 1972 ) ( per curiam ) ) ; see also Maynard v. Cartwright , 486 U. S. 356 , 362 ( 1988 ) ( Since Furman , our cases have insisted that the channeling and limiting of the sentencers discretion in imposing the death penalty is a fundamental constitutional requirement for sufficiently minimizing the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action. ) ; Apprendi , 530 U. S. , at 522523 ( Thomas , J. , concurring ) ( [I]n the area of capital punishment , unlike any other area , we have imposed special constraints on a legislatures ability to determine what facts shall lead to what punishmentwe have restricted the legislatures ability to define crimes. ) .	Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted .	35
Apart from the Eighth Amendment provenance of aggravating factors , Arizona presents no specific reason for excepting capital defendants from the constitutional protections … extend[ed ] to defendants generally , and none is readily apparent. Id. , at 539 ( OConnor , J. , dissenting ) . The notion that the Eighth Amendments restriction on a state legislatures ability to define capital crimes should be compensated for by permitting States more leeway under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments in proving an aggravating fact necessary to a capital sentence … is without precedent in our constitutional jurisprudence. Ibid .

In various settings , we have interpreted the Constitution to require the addition of an element or elements to the definition of a criminal offense in order to narrow its scope .

Ohio , 395 U. S. 444 , 447 ( 1969 ) ( per curiam ) ( First Amendment prohibits States from proscrib[ing ] advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action ) ; Lambert v.

S. 225 , 229 ( 1957 ) ( Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment requires actual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the probability of such knowledge before ex - felon may be convicted of failing to register presence in municipality ) . If a legislature responded to one of these decisions by adding the element we held constitutionally required , surely the Sixth Amendment guarantee would apply to that element . We see no reason to differentiate capital crimes from all others in this regard .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9

For the reasons stated , we hold that Walton and Apprendi are irreconcilable ; our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence can not be home to both . Accordingly , we overrule Walton to the extent that it allows a sentencing judge , sitting without a jury , to find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty . See 497 U. S. , at 647649 . Because Arizonas enumerated aggravating factors operate as the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense, Apprendi , 530 U. S. , at 494 , n. 19 , the Sixth Amendment requires that they be found by a jury .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
The guarantees of jury trial in the Federal and State Constitutions reflect a profound judgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered . … If the defendant preferred the common - sense judgment of a jury to the more tutored but perhaps less sympathetic reaction of the single judge , he was to have it. Duncan v.

The right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment would be senselessly diminished if it encompassed the factfinding necessary to increase a defendants sentence by two years , but not the factfinding necessary to put him to death .

The question whether Walton v. Arizona , 497 U. S. 639 ( 1990 ) , survives our decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U. S. 466 ( 2000 ) , confronts me with a difficult choice . What compelled Arizona ( and many other States ) to specify particular aggravating factors that must be found before the death penalty can be imposed , see 1973 Ariz. Sess . Laws ch . 138 , § 5 ( originally codified as Ariz. Rev. Stat . § 13454 ) , was the line of this Courts cases beginning with Furman v. Georgia , 408 U. S. 238 ( 1972 ) ( per curiam ) . See Walton , 497 U. S. , at 659660 ( Scalia , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) . In my view , that line of decisions had no proper foundation in the Constitution . Id. , at 670 (  [T]he prohibition of the Eighth Amendment relates to the character of the punishment , and not to the process by which it is imposed  ( quoting Gardner v. Florida , 430 U. S. 349 , 371 ( 1977 ) ( R ehnquist , J. , dissenting ) ) ) . I am therefore reluctant to magnify the burdens that our Furman jurisprudence imposes on the States . Better for the Court to have invented an evidentiary requirement that a judge can find by a preponderance of the evidence , than to invent one that a unanimous jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt .	Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted .	35
On the other hand , as I wrote in my dissent in Almendarez - Torres v. United States , 523 U. S. 224 , 248 ( 1998 ) , and as I reaffirmed by joining the opinion for the Court in Apprendi , I believe that the fundamental meaning of the jury - trial guarantee of the Sixth Amendment is that all facts essential to imposition of the level of punishment that the defendant receiveswhether the statute calls them elements of the offense , sentencing factors , or Mary Janemust be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
The quandary is apparent : Should I continue to apply the last - stated principle when I know that the only reason the fact is essential is that this Court has mistakenly said that the Constitution requires state law to impose such aggravating factors ? In Walton , to tell the truth , the Sixth Amendment claim was not put with the clarity it obtained in Almendarez - Torres and Apprendi . There what the appellant argued had to be found by the jury was not all facts essential to imposition of the death penalty , but rather  every finding of fact underlying the sentencing decision, including not only the aggravating factors without which the penalty could not be imposed , but also the mitigating factors that might induce a sentencer to give a lesser punishment . 497 U. S. , at 647 ( emphasis added ) . But even if the point had been put with greater clarity in Walton , I think I still would have approved the Arizona schemeI would have favored the States freedom to develop their own capital sentencing procedures ( already erroneously abridged by Furman ) over the logic of the Apprendi principle .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	27
Since Walton , I have acquired new wisdom that consists of two realizationsor , to put it more critically , have discarded old ignorance that consisted of the failure to realize two things : First , that it is impossible to identify with certainty those aggravating factors whose adoption has been wrongfully coerced by Furman , as opposed to those that the State would have adopted in any event . Some States , for example , already had aggravating - factor requirements for capital murder ( e.g. , murder of a peace officer , see 1965 N. Y. Laws p. 1022 ( originally codified at N. Y. Penal Law § 1045 ) ) when Furman was decided . When such a State has added aggravating factors , are the new ones the Apprendi -exempt product of Furman , and the old ones not ? And even as to those States that did not previously have aggravating - factor requirements , who is to say that their adoption of a new one todayor , for that matter , even their retention of old ones adopted immediately post- Furman is still the product of that case , and not of a changed social belief that murder simpliciter does not deserve death ?	@@empty@@	unmatched
Second , and more important , my observing over the past 12 years the accelerating propensity of both state and federal legislatures to adopt sentencing factors determined by judges that increase punishment beyond what is authorized by the jurys verdict , and my witnessing the belief of a near majority of my colleagues that this novel practice is perfectly OK , see Apprendi , supra , at 523 ( OConnor , J. , dissenting ) , cause me to believe that our peoples traditional belief in the right of trial by jury is in perilous decline . That decline is bound to be confirmed , and indeed accelerated , by the repeated spectacle of a mans going to his death because a judge found that an aggravating factor existed . We can not preserve our veneration for the protection of the jury in criminal cases if we render ourselves callous to the need for that protection by regularly imposing the death penalty without it .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Accordingly , whether or not the States have been erroneously coerced into the adoption of aggravating factors, wherever those factors exist they must be subject to the usual requirements of the common law , and to the requirement enshrined in our Constitution , in criminal cases : they must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt .	@@empty@@	unmatched
I add one further point , lest the holding of todays decision be confused by the separate concurrence . Justice Breyer , who refuses to accept Apprendi , see 530 U. S. , at 555 ( Breyer , J. , dissenting ) ; see also Harris v. United States , ante , p. _ _ _ ( Breyer , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) , nonetheless concurs in todays judgment because he believe[s ] that jury sentencing in capital cases is mandated by the Eighth Amendment. Post , at 1 ( opinion concurring in judgment ) . While I am , as always , pleased to travel in Justice B reyer s company , the unfortunate fact is that todays judgment has nothing to do with jury sentencing . What todays decision says is that the jury must find the existence of the fact that an aggravating factor existed . Those States that leave the ultimate life - or - death decision to the judge may continue to do soby requiring a prior jury finding of aggravating factor in the sentencing phase or , more simply , by placing the aggravating - factor determination ( where it logically belongs anyway ) in the guilt phase . There is really no way in which Justice Breyer can travel with the happy band that reaches todays result unless he says yes to Apprendi . Concisely put , Justice Breyer is on the wrong flight ; he should either get off before the doors close , or buy a ticket to Apprendi -land .	Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted .	35
I understand why the Court holds that the reasoning of Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U. S. 466 ( 2000 ) , is irreconcilable with Walton v. Arizona , 497 U. S. 639 ( 1990 ) . Yet in choosing which to overrule , I would choose Apprendi , not Walton .	@@empty@@	unmatched
I continue to believe , for the reasons I articulated in my dissent in Apprendi , that the decision in Apprendi was a serious mistake . As I argued in that dissent , Apprendi s rule that any fact that increases the maximum penalty must be treated as an element of the crime is not required by the Constitution , by history , or by our prior cases . See 530 U. S. , at 524552 . Indeed , the rule directly contradicts several of our prior cases . See i d . , at 531539 ( explaining that the rule conflicts with Patterson v. New York , 432 U. S. 197 ( 1977 ) , Almendarez - Torres v. United States , 523 U. S. 224 ( 1998 ) , and Walton , supra ) . And it ignores the significant history in this country of … discretionary sentencing by judges. 530 U. S. , at 544 ( OConnor , J. , dissenting ) . The Court has failed , both in Apprendi and in the decision announced today , to offer any meaningful justification for deviating from years of cases both suggesting and holding that application of the increase in the maximum penalty rule is not required by the Constitution. Id. , at 539 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Not only was the decision in Apprendi unjustified in my view , but it has also had a severely destabilizing effect on our criminal justice system . I predicted in my dissent that the decision would unleash a flood of petitions by convicted defendants seeking to invalidate their sentences in whole or in part on the authority of [ Apprendi ] . Id. , at 551 . As of May 31 , 2002 , less than two years after Apprendi was announced , the United States Courts of Appeals had decided approximately 1,802 criminal appeals in which defendants challenged their sentences , and in some cases even their convictions , under Apprendi . 1 These federal appeals are likely only the tip of the iceberg , as federal criminal prosecutions represent a tiny fraction of the total number of criminal prosecutions nationwide . See ibid . ( OConnor , J. , dissenting ) ( In 1998 … federal criminal prosecutions represented only about 0.4 % of the total number of criminal prosecutions in federal and state courts ) . The number of second or successive habeas corpus petitions filed in the federal courts also increased by 77 % in 2001 , a phenomenon the Administrative Office of the United States Courts attributes to prisoners bringing Apprendi claims . Administrative Office of the U. S. Courts , 2001 Judicial Business 17 . This Court has been similarly overwhelmed by the aftershocks of Apprendi . A survey of the petitions for certiorari we received in the past year indicates that 18 % raised Apprendi -related claims . 2 It is simply beyond dispute that Apprendi threw countless criminal sentences into doubt and thereby caused an enormous increase in the workload of an already overburdened judiciary .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The decision today is only going to add to these already serious effects . The Court effectively declares five States capital sentencing schemes unconstitutional . See ante , at 21 , n. 5 ( identifying Colorado , Idaho , Montana , and Nebraska as having sentencing schemes like Arizonas ) . There are 168 prisoners on death row in these States , Criminal Justice Project of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund , Inc. , Death Row U. S. A. ( Spring 2002 ) , each of whom is now likely to challenge his or her death sentence . I believe many of these challenges will ultimately be unsuccessful , either because the prisoners will be unable to satisfy the standards of harmless error or plain error review , or because , having completed their direct appeals , they will be barred from taking advantage of todays holding on federal collateral review . See 28 U. S. C. § § 2244(b)(2)(A ) ; Teague v. Lane , 489 U. S. 288 ( 1989 ) . Nonetheless , the need to evaluate these claims will greatly burden the courts in these five States . In addition , I fear that the prisoners on death row in Alabama , Delaware , Florida , and Indiana , which the Court identifies as having hybrid sentencing schemes in which the jury renders an advisory verdict but the judge makes the ultimate sentencing determination , see ante , at 21 , n. 6 , may also seize on todays decision to challenge their sentences . There are 529 prisoners on death row in these States . Criminal Justice Project , supra .	@@empty@@	unmatched
By expanding on Apprendi , the Court today exacerbates the harm done in that case . Consistent with my dissent , I would overrule Apprendi rather than Walton .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Respondent public high school student ( hereafter respondent ) delivered a speech nominating a fellow student for a student elective office at a voluntary assembly that was held during school hours as part of a school - sponsored educational program in self - government , and that was attended by approximately 600 students , many of whom were 14-year - olds .

1 . The First Amendment did not prevent the School District from disciplining respondent for giving the offensively lewd and indecent speech at the assembly . Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist . , 393 U.S. 503 , distinguished . Under the First Amendment , the use of an offensive form of expression may not be prohibited to adults making what the speaker considers a political point , but it does not follow that the same latitude must be permitted to children in a public school . It is a highly appropriate function of public school education to prohibit the use of vulgar and offensive terms in public discourse . Nothing in the Constitution prohibits the states from insisting that certain modes of expression are inappropriate and subject to sanctions . The inculcation of these values is truly the work of the school , and the determination of what manner of speech is inappropriate properly rests with the school board . First Amendment jurisprudence recognizes an interest in protecting minors from exposure to vulgar and offensive spoken language , FCC v. Pacifica Foundation , 438 U.S. 726 , as well as limitations on the otherwise absolute interest of the speaker in reaching an unlimited audience where the speech is sexually explicit and the audience may include children .

These fundamental values of " habits and manners of civility " essential to a democratic society must , of course , include tolerance of divergent political and religious views , even when the views expressed may be unpopular . But these " fundamental values " must also take into account consideration of the sensibilities of others , and , in the case of a school , the sensibilities of fellow students .

By glorifying male sexuality , and in its verbal content , the speech was acutely insulting to teenage girl students . See App . 77 - 81 . The speech could well be seriously damaging to its less mature audience , many of whom were only 14 years old and on the threshold of awareness of human sexuality . Some students were reported as [ p684 ] bewildered by the speech and the reaction of mimicry it provoked .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This Court 's First Amendment jurisprudence has acknowledged limitations on the otherwise absolute interest of the speaker in reaching an unlimited audience where the speech is sexually explicit and the audience may include children . In Ginsberg v. New York , 390 U.S. 629 ( 1968 ) , this Court upheld a New York statute banning the sale of sexually oriented material to minors , even though the material in question was entitled to First Amendment protection with respect to adults . And in addressing the question whether the First Amendment places any limit on the authority of public schools to remove books from a public school library , all Members of the Court , otherwise sharply divided , acknowledged that the school board has the authority to remove books that are vulgar . Board of Education v. Pico , 457 U.S. 853 , 871 - 872 ( 1982 ) ( plurality opinion ) ; i d . at 879 - 881 ( BLACKMUN , J. , concurring in part and in judgment ) ; i d . at 918 - 920 ( REHNQUIST , J. , dissenting ) . These cases recognize the obvious concern on the part of parents , and school authorities acting in loco parentis , to protect children especially in a captive audience -- from exposure to sexually explicit , indecent , or lewd speech .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We have also recognized an interest in protecting minors from exposure to vulgar and offensive spoken language . In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation , 438 U.S. 726 ( 1978 ) , we dealt with the power of the Federal Communications Commission to regulate a radio broadcast described as " indecent but not obscene . " There the Court reviewed an administrative condemnation of the radio broadcast of a self - styled " humorist " who described his own performance as being in " the words you could n't say on the public , ah , airwaves , um , the ones you definitely would n't say ever . " Id. at 729 ; see also i d . at 751 - 755 ( Appendix to opinion of the Court ) . The Commission concluded that " certain words depicted sexual and excretory activities in a patently offensive manner , [ and ] noted [ p685 ] that they ‘ were broadcast at a time when children were undoubtedly in the audience . ' " The Commission issued an order declaring that the radio station was guilty of broadcasting indecent language in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1464 . 438 U.S. at 732 . The Court of Appeals set aside the Commission 's determination , and we reversed , reinstating the Commission 's citation of the station . We concluded that the broadcast was properly considered " obscene , indecent , or profane " within the meaning of the statute . The plurality opinion went on to reject the radio station 's assertion of a First Amendment right to broadcast vulgarity :	@@empty@@	unmatched

We hold that petitioner School District acted entirely within its permissible authority in imposing sanctions upon Fraser in response to his offensively lewd and indecent speech . Unlike the sanctions imposed on the students wearing armbands in Tinker , the penalties imposed in this case were unrelated to any political viewpoint . The First Amendment does not prevent the school officials from determining that to permit a vulgar and lewd speech such as respondent 's would undermine the school 's basic educational mission . A high school assembly or classroom is no place for a sexually explicit monologue directed towards an unsuspecting audience of teenage students . Accordingly , it was perfectly appropriate for the school to disassociate itself to make the point to the pupils that vulgar speech and lewd conduct is wholly inconsistent with the " fundamental values " of public [ p686 ] school education . Justice Black , dissenting in Tinker , made a point that is especially relevant in this case :	@@empty@@	unmatched

Cf . Arnett v. Kennedy , 416 U.S. 134 , 161 ( 1974 ) ( REHNQUIST , J. , concurring ) . Two days ' suspension from school does not rise to the level of a penal sanction calling for the full panoply of procedural due process protections applicable to a criminal prosecution . Cf . Goss v. Lopez , 419 U.S. 565 ( 1975 ) . The school disciplinary rule proscribing " obscene " language and the prespeech admonitions of teachers gave adequate warning to Fraser that his lewd speech could subject him to sanctions .

Petitioners also challenge the ruling of the District Court that the removal of Fraser 's name from the ballot for graduation speaker violated his due process rights because that sanction was not indicated as a potential punishment in the school 's disciplinary rules . We agree with the Court of Appeals that this issue has become moot , since the graduation ceremony has long since passed and Fraser was permitted to speak in accordance with the District Court 's injunction . No part of the damages award was based upon the removal of Fraser 's name from the list , since damages were based upon the loss of two days ' schooling .	@@empty@@	unmatched
JUSTICE BRENNAN , concurring in the judgment .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Respondent gave the following speech at a high school assembly in support of a candidate for student government office :	@@empty@@	unmatched
App . 47 . The Court , referring to these remarks as " obscene , " " vulgar , " " lewd , " and " offensively lewd , " concludes that school officials properly punished respondent for uttering the speech . Having read the full text of respondent 's remarks , I find it difficult to believe that it is the same speech the Court describes . To my mind , the most that can be said about respondent 's speech -- and all that need be said -- is that , in light of the discretion school officials have to teach high school students how to conduct civil and effective public discourse , and to prevent disruption of school educational activities , it was [ p688 ] not unconstitutional for school officials to conclude , under the circumstances of this case , that respondent 's remarks exceeded permissible limits . Thus , while I concur in the Court 's judgment , I write separately to express my understanding of the breadth of the Court 's holding .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court today reaffirms the unimpeachable proposition that students do not " ‘ shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate . ' " Ante at 680 ( quoting Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist . , 393 U.S. 503 , 506 ( 1969 ) ) . If respondent had given the same speech outside of the school environment , he could not have been penalized simply because government officials considered his language to be inappropriate , see Cohen v. California , 403 U.S. 15 ( 1971 ) ; the Court 's opinion does not suggest otherwise . [ n1 ] Moreover , despite the Court 's characterizations , the language respondent used is far removed from the very narrow class of " obscene " speech which the Court has held is not protected by the First Amendment . Ginsberg v. New York , 390 U.S. 629 , 635 ( 1968 ) ; Roth v. United States , 354 U.S. 476 , 485 ( 1957 ) . It is true , however , that the State has interests in teaching high school students how to conduct civil and effective public discourse and in avoiding disruption of educational school activities . Thus , the Court holds that , under certain circumstances , high school students may properly be reprimanded for giving a speech at a high school assembly which school officials conclude disrupted the school 's educational [ p689 ] mission . [ n2 ] Respondent 's speech may well have been protected had he given it in school but under different circumstances , where the school 's legitimate interests in teaching and maintaining civil public discourse were less weighty .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In the present case , school officials sought only to ensure that a high school assembly proceed in an orderly manner . There is no suggestion that school officials attempted to regulate respondent 's speech because they disagreed with the views he sought to express . Cf . Tinker , supra . Nor does this case involve an attempt by school officials to ban written materials they consider " inappropriate " for high school students , cf . Board of Education v. Pico , 457 U.S. 853 ( 1982 ) , or to limit what students should hear , read , or learn about . Thus , the Court 's holding concerns only the authority that school officials have to restrict a high school student 's use of disruptive language in a speech given to a high school assembly .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The authority school officials have to regulate such speech by high school students is not limitless . See Thomas v. Board of Education , Granville Central School Dist . , 607 F.2d 1043 , 1057 ( CA2 1979 ) ( Newman , J. , concurring in result ) ( " [ S]chool officials . . . do [ not ] have limitless discretion to apply their own notions of indecency . Courts have a First [ p690 ] Amendment responsibility to insure that robust rhetoric . . . is not suppressed by prudish failures to distinguish the vigorous from the vulgar " ) . Under the circumstances of this case , however , I believe that school officials did not violate the First Amendment in determining that respondent should be disciplined for the disruptive language he used while addressing a high school assembly . [ n3 ] Thus , I concur in the judgment reversing the decision of the Court of Appeals .	@@empty@@	unmatched
JUSTICE MARSHALL , dissenting .	@@empty@@	unmatched
I agree with the principles that JUSTICE BRENNAN sets out in his opinion concurring in the judgment . I dissent from the Court 's decision , however , because , in my view , the School District failed to demonstrate that respondent 's remarks were indeed disruptive . The District Court and Court of Appeals conscientiously applied Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist . , 393 U.S. 503 ( 1969 ) , and concluded that the School District had not demonstrated any disruption of the educational process . I recognize that the school administration must be given wide latitude to determine what forms of conduct are inconsistent with the school 's educational mission ; nevertheless , where speech is involved , we may not unquestioningly accept a teacher 's or administrator 's assertion that certain pure speech interfered with education . Here the School District , despite a clear opportunity to do so , failed to bring in evidence sufficient to convince either of the two lower courts that education at Bethel School was disrupted by respondent 's speech . I therefore see no reason to disturb the Court of Appeals ' judgment . [ p691 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched

" Frankly , my dear , I do n't give a damn . "	@@empty@@	unmatched
When I was a high school student , the use of those words in a public forum shocked the Nation . Today Clark Gable 's four - letter expletive is less offensive than it was then . Nevertheless , I assume that high school administrators may prohibit the use of that word in classroom discussion and even in extracurricular activities that are sponsored by the school and held on school premises . For I believe a school faculty must regulate the content as well as the style of student speech in carrying out its educational mission . [ n1 ] It does seem to me , however , that , if a student is to be punished for using offensive speech , he is entitled to fair notice of the scope of the prohibition and the consequences of its violation . [ p692 ] The interest in free speech protected by the First Amendment and the interest in fair procedure protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment combine to require this conclusion .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This respondent was an outstanding young man with a fine academic record . The fact that he was chosen by the student body to speak at the school 's commencement exercises demonstrates that he was respected by his peers . This fact is relevant for two reasons . It confirms the conclusion that the discipline imposed on him -- a 3-day suspension and ineligibility to speak at the school 's graduation exercises-- was sufficiently serious to justify invocation of the School District 's grievance procedures . See Goss v. Lopez , 419 U.S. 565 , 574 - 575 ( 1975 ) . More importantly , it indicates that he was probably in a better position to determine whether an audience composed of 600 of his contemporaries would be offended by the use of a four - letter word -- or a sexual metaphor -- than is a group of judges who are at least two generations and 3,000 miles away from the scene of the crime . [ n2 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
The fact that the speech may not have been offensive to his audience -- or that he honestly believed that it would be inoffensive -- does not mean that he had a constitutional right to deliver it . For the school -- not the student -- must prescribe the rules of conduct in an educational institution . [ n3 ] But it [ p693 ] does mean that he should not be disciplined for speaking frankly in a school assembly if he had no reason to anticipate punitive consequences .	@@empty@@	unmatched
One might conclude that respondent should have known that he would be punished for giving this speech on three quite different theories : ( 1 ) it violated the " Disruptive Conduct " rule published in the student handbook ; ( 2 ) he was specifically warned by his teachers ; or ( 3 ) the impropriety is so obvious that no specific notice was required . I discuss each theory in turn .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Disciplinary Rule	@@empty@@	unmatched
At the time the discipline was imposed , as well as in its defense of this lawsuit , the school took the position that respondent violated the following published rule :	@@empty@@	unmatched

Id. at 1360 - 1361 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Thus , the evidence in the record , as interpreted by the District Court and the Court of Appeals , makes it perfectly clear that respondent 's speech was not " conduct " prohibited by the disciplinary rule . [ n4 ] Indeed , even if the language of the rule could be stretched to encompass the nondisruptive use of obscene or profane language , there is no such language in respondent 's speech . What the speech does contain is a sexual metaphor that may unquestionably be offensive to some listeners in some settings . But if an impartial judge puts his [ p695 ] or her own views about the metaphor to one side , I simply can not understand how he or she could conclude that it is embraced by the above - quoted rule . At best , the rule is sufficiently ambiguous that , without a further explanation or construction , it could not advise the reader of the student handbook that the speech would be forbidden . [ n5 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Specific Warning by the Teachers	@@empty@@	unmatched
Respondent read his speech to three different teachers before he gave it . Mrs. Irene Hicks told him that she thought the speech " was inappropriate , and that he probably should not deliver it . " App . 30 . Steven DeHart told respondent " that this would indeed cause problems in that it would raise eyebrows . " Id. at 61 . The third teacher , Shawn Madden , did not testify . None of the three suggested that the speech might violate a school rule . Id. at 49 - 50 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The fact that respondent reviewed the text of his speech with three different teachers before he gave it does indicate that he must have been aware of the possibility that it would provoke an adverse reaction , but the teachers ' responses certainly did not give him any better notice of the likelihood of discipline than did the student handbook itself . In my opinion , therefore , the most difficult question is whether the speech was so obviously offensive that an intelligent high school student must be presumed to have realized that he would be punished for giving it .

It seems fairly obvious that respondent 's speech would be inappropriate in certain classroom and formal social settings . On the other hand , in a locker room or perhaps in a school corridor , the metaphor in the speech might be regarded as rather routine comment . If this be true , and if respondent 's audience consisted almost entirely of young people with whom he conversed on a daily basis , can we -- at this distance -- confidently assert that he must have known that the school administration would punish him for delivering it ?	@@empty@@	unmatched
For three reasons , I think not . First , it seems highly unlikely that he would have decided to deliver the speech if he had known that it would result in his suspension and disqualification from delivering the school commencement address . Second , I believe a strong presumption in favor of free expression should apply whenever an issue of this kind is arguable . Third , because the Court has adopted the policy of applying contemporary community standards in evaluating expression with sexual connotations , this Court should defer to the views of the district and circuit judges who are in a much better position to evaluate this speech than we are .	@@empty@@	unmatched

On October 25 , 1954 , a grand jury returned an indictment , Count 1 of which charged petitioners and others with conspiring among themselves and with others ' to defraud the United States in the exercise of its governmental functions of administering the internal revenue laws and of detecting and prosecuting violations of the internal revenue laws free from bribery , unlawful impairment , obstruction , improper influence , dishonesty , fraud and corruption * * * .

The proofs at the trial presented a sordid picture of a ring engaged in the business of ' fixing ' tax fraud cases by the use of bribes and improper influence . In general outline , the petitioners ' scheme , which is set forth in more detail in the Court of Appeals ' opinion , 4 was as follows :	@@empty@@	unmatched
In 1947 and 1948 two New York business firms , Patullo Modes and Gotham Beef Co. , were under investigation by the Bureau of Internal Revenue for suspected fraudulent tax evasion . Through intermediaries , both firms established contact with Halperin , a New York attorney , and his associates in law practice . Halperin in turn conducted negotiations on behalf of these firms with Grunewald , an ' influential ' friend in Washington , and reported that Grunewald , for a large cash fee , would undertake to prevent criminal prosecution of the taxpayers . Grunewald then used his influence with Bolich , an official in the Bureau , to obtain ' no prosecution ' rulings 5 in the two tax cases . These rulings were handed down in 1948 and 1949 . Grunewald , through Halperin , was subsequently paid $ 60,000 by Gotham and $ 100,000 by Patullo . 6	@@empty@@	unmatched
Subsequent activities of the conspirators were directed at concealing the irregularities in the disposition of the Patullo and Gotham cases . Bolich attempted to have the Bureau of Internal Revenue report on the Patullo case ' doctored , ' and careful steps were taken to cover up the traces of the cash fees paid to Grunewald . In 1951 a congressional investigation was started by the King Committee of the House of Representatives ; the conspirators felt themselves threatened and took steps to hide their traces . Thus Bolich caused the disappearance of certain records linking him to Grunewald , and the taxpayers were repeatedly warned to keep quiet . In 1952 the taxpayers and the conspirators were called before a Brooklyn grand jury . Halperin attempted to induce the taxpayers not to reveal the conspiracy , and Grunewald asked his secretary not to talk to the grand jury . These attempts at concealment were , however , in vain . The taxpayers and some of Halperin 's associates revealed the entire scheme , and petitioners ' indictment and conviction followed . 7	@@empty@@	unmatched
The first question before us is whether the prosecution of these petitioners on Count 1 of the indictment was barred by the applicable three - year statute of limitations . 8	@@empty@@	unmatched
The indictment in these cases was returned on October 25 , 1954 . It was therefore incumbent on the Government to prove that the conspiracy , as contemplated in the agreement as finally formulated , was still in existence on October 25 , 1951 , and that at least one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy was performed after that date . 9 For where substantiation of a conspiracy charge requires proof of an overt act , it must be shown both that the conspiracy still subsisted within the three years prior to the return of the indictment , and that at least one overt act in furtherance of the conspiratorial agreement was performed within that period . Hence , in both of these aspects , the crucial question in determining whether the statute of limitations has run is the scope of the conspiratorial agreement , for it is that which determines both the duration of the conspiracy , and whether the act relied on as an overt act may properly be regarded as in furtherance of the conspiracy . 10	@@empty@@	unmatched
Petitioners , in contending that this prosecution was barred by limitations , state that the object of the conspiratorial agreement was a narrow one : to obtain ' no prosecution ' rulings in the two tax cases . When these rulings were obtained , in October 1948 in the case of Gotham Beef , and in January 1949 in the case of Patullo Modes , the criminal object of the conspiracy , petitioners say , was attained and the conspirators ' function ended . They argue , therefore , that the statute of limitations started running no later than January 1949 , and that the prosecution was therefore barred by 1954 , when the indictment was returned . 11	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Government counters with two principal contentions : First , it urges that even if the main object of the conspiracy was to obtain decisions from the Bureau of Internal Revenue not to institute criminal tax prosecutionsdecisions obtained in 1948 and 1949the indictment alleged , 12 and the proofs showed , that the conspiracy also included as a subsidiary element an agreement to conceal the conspiracy to ' fix ' these tax cases , to the end that the conspirators would escape detection and punishment for their crime . Says the Government , ' from the very nature of the conspiracy * * * there had to be , and was , from the outset a conscious , deliberate , agreement to conceal * * * each and every aspect of the conspiracy * * * . ' It is then argued that since the alleged conspiracy to conceal clearly continued long after the main criminal purpose of the conspiracy was accomplished , and since overt acts in furtherance of the agreement to conceal were performed well within the indictment period , the prosecution was timely .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Second , and alternatively , the Government contends that the central aim of the conspiracy was to obtain for these taxpayers , not merely a ' no prosecution ' ruling , but absolute immunity from tax prosecution ; in other words , that the objectives of the conspiracy were not attained until 1952 , when the statute of limitations ran on the tax cases which these petitioners undertook to ' fix . ' The argument then is that since the conspiracy did not end until 1952 , and since the 19491952 acts of concealment may be regarded as , at least in part , in furtherance of the objective of the conspirators to immunize the taxpayers from tax prosecution , the indictment was timely .	@@empty@@	unmatched
For reasons hereafter given , we hold that the Government 's first contention must be rejected , and that as to its second , which the Court of Appeals accepted , a new trial must be ordered .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We think that the Government 's first theorythat an agreement to conceal a conspiracy can , on facts such as these , be deemed part of the conspiracy and can extend its duration for the purposes of the statute of limitationshas already been rejected by this Court in Krulewitch v. United States , 336 U.S. 440 , 69 S.Ct . 716 , 718 , 93 L.Ed . 790 , and in Lutwak v. United States , 344 U.S. 604 , 73 S.Ct . 481 , 97 L.Ed . 593 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In Krulewitch the question before the Court was whether certain hearsay declarations could be introduced against one of the conspirators . The declarations in question were made by one named in the indictment as a co - conspirator after the main object of the conspiracy ( transporting a woman to Florida for immoral purposes ) had been accomplished . The Government argued that the conspiracy was not ended , however , since it included an implied subsidiary conspiracy to conceal the crime after its commission , and that the declarations were therefore still in furtherance of the conspiracy and binding on co - conspirators . This Court rejected the Government 's argument . It then stated :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' Conspirators about to commit crimes always expressly or implicitly agree to collaborate with each other to conceal facts in order to prevent detection , conviction and punishment . Thus the ( Government 's ) argument is that even after the central criminal objectives of a conspiracy have succeeded or failed , an implicit subsidiary phase of the conspiracy always survives , the phase which has concealment as its sole objective .	@@empty@@	unmatched
' We can not accept the Government 's contention . * * * The rule contended for by the Government could have far - reaching results . For under this rule plausible arguments could generally be made in conspiracy cases that most out - of - court statements offered in evidence tended to shield co - conspirators . We are not persuaded to adopt the Government 's implicit conspiracy theory which in all criminal conspiracy cases would create automatically a further breach of the general rule against the admission of hearsay evidence . ' 13	@@empty@@	unmatched
Mr. Justice Jackson , concurring , added :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' I suppose no person planning a crime would accept as a collaborator one on whom he thought he could not rely for help if he were caught , but I doubt that this fact warrants an inference of conspiracy for that purpose . * * *	@@empty@@	unmatched

' Moreover , the assumption of an indefinitely continuing offense would result in an indeterminate extension of the statute of limitations .

' 14	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Krulewitch case was reaffirmed in Lutwak v. United States , supra . Here again the question was the admissibility of hearsay declarations of co - conspirators after the main purpose of the conspiracy had been accomplished ; again the Government attempted to extend the life of the conspiracy by an alleged subsidiary conspiracy to conceal . Although in Lutwak , unlike in Krulewitch , the existence of a subsidiary conspiracy to conceal was charged in the indictment , the Court again rejected the Government 's theory , holding that no such agreement to conceal had been proved or could be implied .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Government urges us to distinguish Krulewitch and Lutwak on the ground that in those cases the attempt was to imply a conspiracy to conceal from the mere fact that the main conspiracy was kept secret and that overt acts of concealment occurred . In contrast , says the Government , here there was an actual agreement to conceal the conspirators , which was charged and proved to be an express part of the initial conspiracy itself .	@@empty@@	unmatched

The crucial teaching of Krulewitch and Lutwak is that after the central criminal purposes of a conspiracy have been attained , a subsidiary conspiracy to conceal may not be implied from circumstantial evidence showing merely that the conspiracy was kept a secret and that the conspirators took care to cover up their crime in order to escape detection and punishment . As was there stated , allowing such a conspiracy to conceal to be inferred or implied from mere overt acts of concealment would result in a great widening of the scope of conspiracy prosecutions , since it would extend the life of a conspiracy indefinitely . Acts of covering up , even though done in the context of a mutually understood need for secrecy , can not themselves constitute proof that concealment of the crime after its commission was part of the initial agreement among the conspirators . For every conspiracy is by its very nature secret ; a case can hardly be supposed where men concert together for crime and advertise their purpose to the world . And again , every conspiracy will inevitably be followed by actions taken to cover the conspirators ' traces . Sanctioning the Government 's theory would for all practical purposes wipe out the statute of limitations in conspiracy cases , as well as extend indefinitely the time within which hearsay declarations will bind co - conspirators .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A reading of the record before us reveals that on the facts of this case the distinction between ' actual ' and ' implied ' conspiracies to conceal , as urged upon us by the Government , is no more than a verbal tour de force . True , in both Krulewitch and Lutwak there is language in the opinions stressing the fact that only an implied agreement to conceal was relied on . 15 Yet when we look to the facts of the present cases , we see that the evidence from which the Government here asks us to deduce an ' actual ' agreement to conceal reveals nothing beyond that adduced in prior cases . What is this evidence ? First , we have the fact that from the beginning the conspirators insisted on secrecy . Thus the identities of Grunewald and Bolich were sedulously kept from the taxpayers ; careful steps were taken to hide the conspiracy from an independent law firm which was also working on Patullo 's tax problems ; and the taxpayers were told to make sure that their books did not reflect the large cash payments made to Grunewald . Secondly , after the ' no prosecution ' rulings were obtained , we have facts showing that this secrecy was still maintained . Thus , a deliberate attempt was made to make the above - mentioned independent law firm believe that it was its ( quite legitimate ) efforts which produced the successful ruling . Finally , we have the fact that great efforts were made to conceal the conspiracy when the danger of exposure appeared . For example , Bolich got rid of certain records showing that he had used Grunewald 's hotel suite in Washington ; Patullo 's accountant was persuaded to lie to the grand jury concerning a check made out to an associate of the conspirators ; Grunewald attempted to persuade his secretary not to talk to the grand jury ; and the taxpayers were repeatedly told by Halperin and his associates to keep quiet .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We find in all this nothing more than what was involved in Krulewitch , that is , ( 1 ) a criminal conspiracy which is carried out in secrecy ; ( 2 ) a continuation of the secrecy after the accomplishment of the crime ; and ( 3 ) desperate attempts to cover up after the crime begins to come to light ; and so we can not agree that this case does not fall within the ban of those prior opinions .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In effect , the differentiation pressed upon us by the Government is one of words rather than of substance . In Krulewitch it was urged that a continuing agreement to conceal should be implied out of the mere fact of conspiracy , and that acts of concealment should be taken as overt acts in furtherance of that implied agreement to conceal . Today the Government merely rearranges the argument . It states that the very same acts of concealment should be used as circumstantial evidence from which it can be inferred that there was from the beginning an ' actual ' agreement to conceal . As we see it , the two arguments amount to the same thing : a conspiracy to conceal is being implied from elements which will be present in virtually every conspiracy case , that is , secrecy plus overt acts of concealment . 16 There is not a shred of direct evidence in this record to show anything like an express original agreement among the conspirators to continue to act in concert in order to cover up , for their own self - protection , traces of the crime after its commission .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Prior cases in this Court have repeatedly warned that we will view with disfavor attempts to broaden the already pervasive and wide - sweeping nets of conspiracy prosecutions . 17 The important considerations of policy behind such warnings need not be again detailed . See Jackson , J. , concurring in Krulewitch v. United States , supra . It is these considerations of policy which govern our holding today . As this case was tried , we have before us a typical example of a situation where the Government , faced by the bar of the three - year statute , is attempting to open the very floodgates against which Krulewitch warned . We can not accede to the proposition that the duration of a conspiracy can be indefinitely lengthened merely because the conspiracy is kept a secret , and merely because the conspirators take steps to bury their traces , in order to avoid detection and punishment after the central criminal purpose has been accomplished .	@@empty@@	unmatched
By no means does this mean that acts of concealment can never have significance in furthering a criminal conspiracy . But a vital distinction must be made between acts of concealment done in furtherance of the main criminal objectives of the conspiracy , and acts of concealment done after these central objectives have been attained , for the purpose only of covering up after the crime . Thus the Government argues in its brief that ' in the crime of kidnapping , the acts of conspirators in hiding while waiting for ransom would clearly by planned acts of concealment which would be in aid of the conspiracy to kidnap . So here , there can be no doubt that * * * all acts of concealment , whether to hide the identity of the conspirators or the action theretofore taken , were unquestionably in furtherance of the initial conspiracy * * * . ' We do not think the analogy is valid . Kidnapers in hiding , waiting for ransom , commit acts of concealment in furtherance of the objectives of the conspiracy itself , just as repainting a stolen car would be in furtherance of a conspiracy to steal ; in both cases the successful accomplishment of the crime necessitates concealment . 18 More closely analogous to our case would be conspiring kidnapers who cover their traces after the main conspiracy is finally endedi.e . , after they have abandoned the kidnaped person and then take care to escape detection . In the latter case , as here , the acts of covering up can by themselves indicate nothing more than that the conspirators do not wish to be apprehendeda concomitant , certainly , of every crime since Cain attempted to conceal the murder of Abel from the Lord .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We hold , therefore , that , considering the main objective of the conspiracy to have been the obtaining of ' no prosecution ' rulings , prosecution was barred by the three - year statute of limitations , since no agreement to conceal the conspiracy after its accomplishment was shown or can be implied on the evidence before us to have been part of the conspiratorial agreement .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In view of how the case was submitted to the jury , we are also unable to accept the Government 's second theory for avoiding the statute of limitations . This theory is ( 1 ) that the main objective of the conspiracy was not merely to obtain the initial ' no prosecution ' rulings in 1948 and 1949 , but to obtain final immunity for Gotham and Patullo from criminal tax prosecution ; ( 2 ) that such immunity was not obtained until 1952 , when the statute of limitations had run on the tax - evasion cases which the petitioners conspired to fix ; 19 ( 3 ) that the conspiracy therefore did not end until 1952 , when this object was attained ; ( 4 ) that the acts of concealment within the indictment period were overt acts in furtherance of this conspiracy ; and ( 5 ) that the prosecution was thus timely . 20 In short , the contention is that the agreement to conceal was to protect the taxpayers rather than the conspirators , and as such was part of the main conspiracy rather than a subsidiary appendage to it , as under the Government 's first theory .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court of Appeals accepted this theory of the case in affirming these convictions . It stated :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' What the fixers had to sell was freedom from criminal prosecution for tax frauds . What the taxpayers bargained for was protection from a tax evasion prosecution .	@@empty@@	unmatched
' This conspiracy is wholly unlike the ordinary illegal scheme in that the jury may well have inferred that the official announcement that there would be no criminal prosecution of the taxpayers was merely the delivery of a substantial installment of what appellants agreed to deliver for the huge sums paid . The six - year Statute of Limitations * * * did not run in favor of the taxpayers until some time after the commission of the overt acts relied upon . In the interval there was no assurance , other than continuing efforts by Grunewald , Bolich and the others , that the whole nefarious business might not be brought to light , followed by the revocation of the decision not to criminally prosecute the taxpayers . This is a significant element in the proofs adduced by the government , as concealment of the conspiratorial acts was necessary not only to protect the conspirators from a conspiracy prosecution but also to protect the taxpayers from a tax evasion prosecution . ' 233 F.2d at pages 564565 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We find the legal theory of the Court of Appeals unexceptionable . If the central objective of the conspiracy was to protect the taxpayers from tax - evasion prosecutions , on which the statute of limitations did not run until 1952 , and if the 1948 and 1949 ' no prosecution ' rulings were but an ' installment ' of what the conspirators aimed to accomplish , then it is clear that the statute of limitations on the conspiracy did not begin to run until 1952 , within three years of the indictment . 21	@@empty@@	unmatched
Furthermore , we agree with the Court of Appeals that there is evidence in this record which would warrant submission of the case to the jury on the theory that the central object of the conspiracy was not attained in 1948 and 1949 , but rather was to immunize the taxpayers completely from prosecution for tax evasion and thus continued into 1952 . The many overt acts of concealment occurring after 1949 could easily have been motivated at least in part by the purpose of the conspirators to deliver the remaining ' installments ' owing under the bargainto wit , the safeguarding of the continued vitality of the ' no prosecution ' rulings . 22 Furthermore , there is evidence showing that from the beginning the aim of the scheme was not restricted to the merely provisional and necessarily precarious ' fixing ' of the taxpayers ' troubles which was achieved in 1948 and 1949 . 23 A jury might therefore fairly infer that it was part of the conspiratorial agreement that Grunewald and Bolich would make continuing efforts to safeguard the fruits of the partial victories won in 1948 and 1949 by trying to immunize the ' no prosecution ' rulings from change . In other words , we think a jury could infer from this evidence that the conspirators were prepared and had agreed to engage in further frauds and bribery if necessary in order to maintain in effect the tentative rulings obtained in 1948 and 1949 . 24	@@empty@@	unmatched
If , therefore , the jury could have found that the aim of the conspiratorial agreement was to protect the taxpayers from tax prosecution , and that the overt acts occurring in the indictment period were in furtherance of that aim , we would affirm . We do not think , however , that we may safely assume that the jury so found , for we can not agree with the Court of Appeals ' holding that this theory of the case was adequately submitted to the jury .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The trial judge 's charge on the problem of the scope and duration of the conspiracy was as follows :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' You will recall that the indictment states , among other things , that it was part of the conspiracy that the defendants and co - conspirators would make ' continuing efforts to avoid detection and prosecution by any governmental body , executive , ligislative , and judicial of tax frauds perpetrated by the defendants and co - conspirators through the use of any means whatsoever including but not limited to * * * the influencing , intimidating , and impeding of prospective witnesses to refrain from disclosing the true facts . ' In other words , the indictment alleges that the conspiracy comprehended within it a conspiracy to conceal the true facts from investigation , should investigation thereafter eventuate . This is an important element of the first count of the indictment which you must take into consideration , inasmuch as the Statute of Limitations of the charge of criminal conspiracy is three years and unless the conspiracy was continuing to a period within three years prior to the date of the indictment , October 25 , 1954 , and some overt act was performed within that three - year period , the crime , if any , alleged in the first count of the indictment would be outlawed . It is the contention of the government that the conspiracy did not end when the taxpayers were advised that there would be no criminal prosecution recommended by the Special Agent 's office , but that an integral part of the entire conspiracy was an agreement to conceal the acts of the conspirators and that when thereafter an investigation was started by Congress and by the Grand Jury in the Eastern District of New York , the conspirators performed overt acts in pursuance of the original conspiracy designed to conceal the true facts ; and that these acts occurred within three years prior to the date of the indictment . On this issue , it will be necessary for you to determine whether , beyond a reasonable doubt , you can conclude that the conspiracy was of the nature described in the first count of the indictment and comprehended an agreement to conceal and whether some overt act took place in the period of three years prior to October 25 , 1954 to carry out such purpose of the conspiracy .	@@empty@@	unmatched
' To determine whether certain of the alleged overt acts were in furtherance of the object of the conspiracy , you have to determine the duration of the conspiracy . Did it end when the Pattullo ( sic ) Modes people and the Gotham Beef people received an assurance of no prosecution from the Bureau of Internal Revenue , or was a part of the conspiracy a continuing agreement to conceal the acts done pursuant thereto ? In determining whether a part of the conspiracy was an agreement to continue to conceal the illegal acts after their consummation , you may not imply that such an agreement was part of the conspiracy . You would have to find from the evidence of the acts and declarations of the co - conspirators that there was an understanding or agreement to conceal the conspiracy . If you find that such an agreement or understanding to conceal the conspiracy was not a part of the conspiracy to defraud the government , but no more than an afterthought brought to the surface when the co - conspirators were confronted with the Grand Jury and King Committee investigations , then you must find , as a matter of law , that the defendants are not guilty of the crime charged in the first count of the indictment . If you find that the evidence shows , beyond a reasonable doubt , that as a part of a conspiracy to defraud the government , there was an agreement or understanding to conceal the illegal acts and that this too was an objective or part of the conspiracy , then you may find that such understanding was a part of the conspiracy . However , you must additionally determine whether this objective of the conspiracy was known to the defendants . If this objective was known originally by only part of the conspirators but thereafter during the existence of the conspiracy , the scope of the conspiracy was extended so as to include such an agreement to conceal , and if you find that some of the defendants did not know of the expansion to include the agreement to conceal , you may not impute to them the knowledge of their co - conspirators and they could not be found guilty of the crime charged in Count One . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
We are constrained to agree with Judge Frank that this charge did not adequately enlighten the jury as to what they would have to find in order to conclude that the conspiracy was still alive after October 25 , 1951 . For the charge as given failed completely to distinguish between concealment in order to achieve the central purpose of the conspiracy ( that is , the immunization of the taxpayers from tax - evasion prosecution ) , and concealment intended solely to cover up an already executed crime(that is , the obtaining of the ' no prosecution ' rulings ) . The jury was never told that these overt acts of concealment could be taken as furthering the conspiracy only if the basic criminal aim of the conspiracy was not yet attained in 1949 . On the charge as given , the jury might easily have concluded that the petitioners were guilty even though they found merely ( 1 ) that the central aim of the conspiracy was accomplished in 1949 , and ( 2 ) that the subsequent acts of concealment were motivated exclusively by the conspirators ' fear of a conspiracy prosecution . As far as we know , therefore , the present convictions were based on the impermissible theory discussed in the first part of this opinionnamely , that a subordinate agreement to conceal the conspiracy continued after the central aim of the conspiracy had been accomplished .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Furthermore , if the convictions were based on a finding that the overt acts of concealment were done with the single intention of protecting the conspirators ' own interests , then it is irrelevant that these acts in fact happened to have the effect also of protecting the taxpayers against revocation of the ' no prosecution ' rulings . For overt acts in a prosecution such as this one are meaningful only if they are within the scope of the conspiratorial agreement . If that agreement did not , expressly or impliedly , contemplate that the conspiracy would continue in its efforts to protect the taxpayers in order to immunize them from tax prosecution , then the scope of the agreement can not be broadened retroactively by the fact that the conspirators took steps after the conspiracy which incidentally had that effect .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We thus find that the judge 's charge left it open for the jury to convict even though they found that the acts of concealment were motivated purely by the purpose of the conspirators to cover up their already accomplished crime . And this , we think , was fatal error . For the facts in this record are equivocal . The jury might easily have concluded that the aim of the conspiracy was accomplished in 1949 , and that the overt acts of concealment occurring after that date were done pursuant to the alleged conspiracy to hide the conspirators . As we have said , a conviction on such a theory could not be sustained . Under such circumstances , therefore , it was essential for the judge to charge clearly and unequivocally that on these facts the jury could not infer a continuing conspiracy to conceal the conspiracy , whether actual or implied . Further , it was incumbent on the judge to charge that in order to convict the jury would have to find that the central aim of the conspiracy was to immunize the taxpayers from tax prosecution , that this objective continued in being through 1951 , and that the overt acts of concealment proved at trial were at least partly calculated to further this aim .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Since , under the judge 's charge , the convictions on Count 1 might have rested on an impermissible ground , we conclude that they can not stand , and the petitioners must be given a new trial as to this Count .	@@empty@@	unmatched
What we have held as to the statute of limitations disposes of the conviction of the three petitioners under Count 1 , but does not touch Halperin 's conviction on Counts 5 , 6 , and 7 for violating 18 U.S.C. 1503 , 18 U.S.C.A. § 1503 . 25 As to those Counts , Halperin , who took the stand in his own defense at the trial , contends ( a ) that the Government was improperly allowed to cross - examine him as to the assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege before a grand jury investigating this conspiracy , before which he had been called as a witness , 26 and ( b ) that the evidence did not justify his conviction on these Counts . For the reasons given hereafter we think that the first contention is well taken , but that the second one is untenable .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In 1952 Halperin was subpoenaed before a Brooklyn grand jury which was investigating corruption in the Bureau of Internal Revenue . Testimony had already been received by the grand jury from the Patullo and Gotham taxpayers , which linked Halperin with the taxfixing ring . Halperin was asked a series of questions before the grand jury , including , among others , such questions as whether he knew Max Steinberg ( an employee of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and a co - defendant in the charge under Count 1 ) ; whether he knew Grunewald ; whether he had held and delivered escrow money paid to Grunewald by Gotham after the ' no prosecution ' ruling ; and whether he had phoned Grunewald to arrange a meeting between one of his own associates and Bolich . Halperin declined to answer any of these questions , on the ground that the answers would tend to incriminate him and that the Fifth Amendment therefore entitled him not to answer . He repeatedly insisted before the grand jury that he was wholly innocent , and that he pleaded his Fifth Amendment privilege only on the advice of counsel that answers to these questions might furnish evidence which could be used against him , particularly when he was not represented by counsel and could not cross - examine witnesses before the grand jury .	@@empty@@	unmatched
When the Government cross - examined Halperin at the trial some of the questions which he had been asked before the grand jury were put to him . 27 He answered each question in a way consistent with innocence . The Government was then allowed , over objection , to bring out in cross - examination that petitioner had pleaded his privilege before the grand jury as to these very questions . Later , in his charge to the jury , the trial judge informed them that petitioner 's Fifth Amendment plea could be taken only as reflecting on his credibility , and that no inference as to guilt or innocence could be drawn therefrom as to Halperin or any co - defendant . 28	@@empty@@	unmatched
In thus allowing this cross - examination , the District Court relied on Raffel v. United States , 271 U.S. 494 , 46 S.Ct . 566 , 70 L.Ed . 1054 , where this Court held that a defendant 's failure to take the stand at his first trial to deny testimony as to an incriminating admission could be used on cross - examination at the second trial , where he did take the stand , to impugn the credibility of his denial of the same admission . In upholding the District Court here , the Court of Appeals likewise relied on Raffel , and also on one of its own earlier decisions . 29 Halperin attacks these rulings on these principal grounds : ( a ) Raffel is distinguishable from the present case ; ( b ) if Raffel permitted this cross - examination , then the trial court erred in refusing to charge , as Halperin requested , that ' an innocent man may honestly claim that his answers may tend to incriminate him ' ; ( c ) in any case Raffel has impliedly been overruled by Johnson v. United States , 318 U.S. 189 , 63 S.Ct . 549 , 87 L.Ed . 704 ; and ( d ) compelling Halperin to testify before the grand jury , when he had already been marked as a putative defendant , violated his constitutional rights , so that , by analogy to the rule of Weeks v. United States , 232 U.S. 383 , 34 S.Ct . 341 , 58 L.Ed . 652 , his claim of privilege could in no event be used against him . We find that in the circumstances presented here Raffel is not controlling , and that this cross - examination was not permissible .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is , of course , an elementary rule of evidence that prior statements may be used to impeach the credibility of a criminal defendant or an ordinary witness . But this can be done only if the judge is satisfied that the prior statements are in fact inconsistent . 3 Wigmore , Evidence , § 1040 . And so the threshold question here is simply whether , in the circumstances of this case , the trial court erred in holding that Halperin 's plea of the Fifth Amendment privilege before the grand jury involved such inconsistency with any of his trial testimony as to permit its use against him for impeachment purposes . 30 We do not think that Raffel is properly to be read either as dispensing with the need for such preliminary scrutiny by the judge , or as establishing as a matter of law that such a prior claim of privilege with reference to a question later answered at the trial is always to be deemed to be a prior inconsistent statement , irrespective of the circumstances under which the claim of privilege was made . The issue decided in Raffel came to the Court as a certified question in quite an abstract form , 31 and was really centered on the question whether a defendant who takes the stand on a second trial can continue to take advantage of the privilege asserted at the first trial . This Court held , in effect , that when a criminal defendant takes the stand , he waives his privilege completely and becomes subject to cross - examination impeaching his credibility just like any other witness : ' His waiver is not partial ; having once cast aside the cloak of immunity , he may not resume it at will , whenever cross - examination may be inconvenient or embarrassing . ' The Court , in Raffel , did not focus on the question whether the cross - examination there involved was in fact probative in impeaching the defendant 's credibility . In other words , we may assume that under Raffel Halperin in this case was subject to cross - examination impeaching his credibility just like any other witness , and that his Fifth Amendment plea before the grand jury could not carry over any form of immunity when he voluntarily took the stand at the trial . This does not , however , solve the question whether in the particular circumstances of this case the cross - examination should have been excluded because its probative value on the issue of Halperin 's credibility was so negligible as to be far outweighed by its possible impermissible impact on the jury . 32 As we consider that in the circumstances of the present case , the trial court , in the exercise of a sound discretion , should have refused to permit this line of cross - examination , we are not faced with the necessity of deciding whether Raffel has been stripped of vitality by the later Johnson case , supra , or of otherwise re - examining Raffel .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We need not tarry long to reiterate our view that , as the two courts below held , no implication of guilt could be drawn from Halperin 's invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege before the grand jury . Recent re - examination of the history and meaning of the Fifth Amendment has emphasized anew that one of the basic functions of the privilege is to protect innocent men . Griswold , The Fifth Amendment Today , 930 , 5382 . ' Too many , even those who should be better advised , view this privilege as a shelter for wrongdoers . They too readily assume that those who invoke it are either guilty of crime or commit perjury in claiming the privilege . ' Ullmann v. United States , 350 U.S. 422 , 426 , 76 S.Ct . 497 , 500 , 100 L.Ed . 511 . See also Slochower v. Board of Higher Education , 350 U.S. 551 , at pages 557558 , 76 S.Ct . 637 , at page 641 , 100 L.Ed . 692 , when , at the same Term , this Court said : ' The privilege serves to protect the innocent who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
When we pass to the issue of credibility , we deem it evident that Halperin 's claim of the Fifth Amendment privilege before the Brooklyn grand jury in response to questions which he answered at the trial was wholly consistent with innocence . Had he answered the questions put to him before the grand jury in the same way he subsequently answered them at trial , this nevertheless would have provided the Government with incriminating evidence from his own mouth . For example , had he stated to the grand jury that he knew Grunewald , the admission would have constituted a link between him and a criminal conspiracy , and this would be true even though he was entirely innocent and even though his friendship with Grunewald was above reproach . There was , therefore , as we see it , no inconsistency between Halperin 's statement to the grand jury that answering the question whether he knew Grunewald would tend to furnish incriminating evidence against him , and his subsequent testimony at trial that his acquiaintance with Grunewald was free of criminal elements . And the same thing is also true , as we see it , as to his claim of privilege with respect to the other questions asked him before the grand jury and his answers to those same questions when they were put to him at the trial . These conclusions are fortified by a number of other considerations surrounding Halperin 's claim of privilege :	@@empty@@	unmatched
First , Halperin repeatedly insisted before the grand jury that he was innocent and that he pleaded his Fifth Amendment privilege solely on the advice of counsel .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Second , the Fifth Amendment claim was made before a grand jury where Halperin was a compelled , and not a voluntary , witness ; where he was not represented by counsel ; where he could summon no witnesses ; and where he had no opportunity to cross - examine witnesses testifying against him . These factors are crucial in weighing whether a plea of the privilege is inconsistent with later exculpatory testimony on the same questions , for the nature of the tribunal which subjects the witness to questioning bears heavily on what inferences can be drawn from a plea of the Fifth Amendment . See Griswold , supra , at 62 . Innocent men are more likely to plead the privilege in secret proceedings , where they testify without advice of counsel and without opportunity for cross - examination , than in open court proceedings , where cross - examination and judicially supervised procedure provide safeguards for the establishing of the whole , as against the possibility of merely partial , truth .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Finally , and most important , we can not deem Halperin 's plea of the Fifth Amendment to be inconsistent with his later testimony at the trial because of the nature of this particular grand - jury proceeding . For , when Halperin was questioned before the grand jury , he was quite evidently already considered a potential defendant . The taxpayers whose cases had been ' fixed ' by the conspiratorial ring had already testified before the grand jury , and they gave there largely the same evidence as they did later , at trial . The scheme was thus in essence already revealed when Halperin was called to testify . Under these circumstances it was evident that Halperin was faced with the possibility of an early indictment , and it was quite natural for him to fear that he was being asked questions for the very purpose of providing evidence against himself . It was thus quite consistent with innocence for him to refuse to provide evidence which could be used by the Government in building its incriminating chain . For many innocent men who know that they are about to be indicted will refuse to help create a case against themselves under circumstances where lack of counsel 's assistance and lack of opportunity for cross - examination will prevent them from bringing out the exculpatory circumstances in the context of which superficially incriminating acts occurred .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We are not unmindful that the question whether a prior statement is sufficiently inconsistent to be allowed to go to the jury on the question of credibility is usually within the discretion of the trial judge . But where such evidentiary matter has grave constitutional overtones , as it does here , we feel justified in exercising this Court 's supervisory control to pass on such a question . This is particularly so because in this case the dangers of impermissible use of this evidence far outweighed whatever advantage the Government might have derived from it if properly used . If the jury here followed the judge 's instructions , namely , that the plea of the Fifth Amendment was relevant only to credibility , then the weight to be given this evidence was less than negligible , since , as we have outlined above , there was no true inconsistency involved ; it could therefore hardly have affected the Government 's case seriously to exclude the matter completely . On the oher hand , the danger that the jury made impermissible use of the testimony by implicitly equating the plea of the Fifth Amendment with guilt is , in light of contemporary history , far from negligible . Weighing these factors , therefore , we feel that we should draw upon our supervisory power over the administration of federal criminal justice in order to rule on the matter . Cf . McNabb v. United States , 318 U.S. 332 , 63 S.Ct . 608 , 87 L.Ed . 819 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We hold that under the circumstances of this case it was prejudicial error for the trial judge to permit cross - examination of petitioner on his plea of the Fifth Amendment privilege before the grand jury , and that Halperin must therefore be given a new trial on Counts 5 , 6 , and 7 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Finally , we find no substance to Halperin 's contention that he was in effect convicted for advising , as a lawyer , some of the witnesses before the grand jury that they had a right to plead their Fifth Amendment privilege . The evidence against Halperin under these Counts was quite sufficient to make out a case for submission to the jury .	@@empty@@	unmatched

In No . 184 , the petitioner , Halperin , appeared before a grand jury in response to a subpoena . There he declined to answer certain questions relying on the provision of the Fifth Amendment that ' No person * * * shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
Later , at his trial , Halperin took the stand to testify in his own behalf . On cross - examination the prosecuting attorney asked him the same questions that he had refused to answer before the grand jury . This time Halperin answered the questions ; his answers tended to show that he was innocent of any wrong - doing . The Government was then permitted over objection to draw from him the fact that he had previously refused to answer these questions before the grand jury on the ground that his answers might tend to incriminate him .	@@empty@@	unmatched
At the conclusion of the trial the judge instructed the jury that Halperin 's claim of his constitutional privilege not to be a witness against himself could be considered in determining what weight should be given to his testimonyin other words , whether Halperin was a truthful and trustworthy witness . I agree with the Court that use of this claim of constitutional privilege to reflect upon Halperin 's credibility was error , but I do not , like the Court , rest my conclusion on the special circumstances of this case . I can think of no special circumstances that would justify use of a constitutional privilege to discredit or convict a person who asserts it . The value of constitutional privileges is largely destroyed if persons can be penalized for relying on them . It seems peculiarly incongrous and indefensible for courts which exist and act only under the Constitution to draw inferences of lack of honesty from invocation of a privilege deemed worthy of enshrinement in the Constitution . To the extent that approval of such a rule in Raffel v. United States , 271 U.S. 494 , 46 S.Ct . 566 , 70 L.Ed . 1054 , has vitality after Johnson v. United States , 318 U.S. 189 , 196199 , 63 S.Ct . 549 , 553554 , 87 L.Ed . 704 , I think the Raffel case should be explicitly overruled .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Appeal from the Circuit Court of the United Court for the Southern District of Illinois	@@empty@@	unmatched
This appeal was taken because of a difference of opinion between the circuit judge and the district judge , holding the circuit court , as to a matter decided , and the facts on which the questions certified depend may be stated as follows :	@@empty@@	unmatched
On the seventh of October , 1871 , the Cairo & St. Louis Railroad Company mortgaged its property , franchises , tolls , incomes , and profits to the Union Trust Company of New York , to secure an issue of bonds amounting in the aggregate to $ 2,500,000 . Default was made in the payment of interest falling due October 1 , 1873 , and semi - annually thereafter . On the sixth of December , 1877 , the trust company filed its bill in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of Illinois to foreclose the mortgage . In the bill it is , among other things , averred that the company is insolvent ; ' that many and large claims exist against said railroad company of the character known as floating debt ; and that unless a receiver is appointed * * * great , irreparable damage to said bondholders will ensue , and the property will be liable to be greatly depreciated , and to be involved in useless litigation ; and your orator and its bondholders will lose the benefit thereof as a security for the payment of said bonds . ' Upon this allegation it was prayed that the ' court will appoint a receiver according to the course and practice of this court , with the usual powers of receivers in like cases . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
As soon as the bill was filed a receiver was appointed , and in making the appointment the court , of its own motion , entered the following order : ' And said receiver , after paying the expenses of operating , maintaining , and repairing said railroad and property , and after making such other payments herein authorized as are or may be necessary for the conduct of such receivership , shall pay and discharge all amounts due and owing by said railroad company for labor , or supplies , that may have accrued in the operation and maintenance of such railroad property within six months immediately preceding the rendition of this decree . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
In 1876 the railroad company paid $ 3,000 to the beneficiaries under the mortgage on account of their expenses , to a much larger amount , in keeping an agency in the United States , and in connection with the forbearance which they had given the company in respect to overdue interest . Previous to the appointment of the receiver none of the current income of the company , except this single amount , had been paid to the bondholders .	@@empty@@	unmatched
When the order in respect to debts for labor and supplies was entered , the court instituted no special inquiries in respect to the use which had been made of the income prior to that time .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The receiver thus appointed took possession of the property and operated the road until the end of the year 1881 , and after a sale had been perfected under a decree of foreclosure . During the receivership the net earnings of the road , after paying all operating expenses , exceeded $ 200,000 . The whole amount was , however , under the orders of the court , with the consent of the trust company , from time to time , expended ' in purchasing additional grounds , rolling - stock , etc . , and in making permanent repairs and improvements upon said railroad property , instead of discharging therewith the claims of against the railroad company for labor , materials , and supplies ' during the six months immediately preceding the appointment of the receiver , and when the property was finally sold over $ 65,000 of these debts remained unpaid . Among them was one to E. E. Souther & Brother amounting to $ 532.14 for supplies . On the ninth of May , 1878 , after the receiver got into possession of the road , Souther & Brother filed in the suit for foreclosure an intervening petition praying for the allowance of their claim and its payment . On the sixteenth of May the claim was allowed and the receiver directed to pay it out of the net earnings , ' and before any improvements or ameliorations are made upon the property in his hands as receiver . ' On the fifth of June both the trust company and receiver filed motions to set aside this order . These motions remaining undisposed of , the road was sold under a decree of foreclosure in 1881 , and brought only $ 4,000,000 , when the amount due under the mortgage was $ 4,300,000 and some more . After the report of the sale was made , and a deficiency appeared , the court , on the eighth of September , 1882 , set aside the order for the payment of the debt to the intervenors and allowed the trust company to answer . An answer was filed and proof taken which disclosed the foregoing facts . Upon the facts so established one of the questions which arose was whether , under the circumstances , the court had the right to make an order directing the payment of the claim . The circuit judge was of the opinion that it had , and a decree was entered accordingly . From that decree this appeal was taken .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Mr. Chief Justice Waite , after stating the case , delivered the opinion of the court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It seems to us that the question certified is fully disposed of by the case of Fosdick v. Schall , 99 U. S. 251 , where it was said : ' We have no doubt that when a court of chancery is asked by railroad mortgagees to appoint a receiver of railroad property , pending proceedings for foreclosure , the court , in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion , may , as a condition of issuing the necessary order , impose such terms in reference to the payment from the income during the receivership of outstanding debts for labor , supplies , equipment , or permanent improvement of the mortgaged property as may , under the circumstances of the particular case , appear to be reasonable . ' To this we adhere , and , in our opinion , the right to impose terms does not depend alone on whether current earnings have been used to pay the mortgage debt , principal or interest , instead of current expenses . Miltenberger v. Logansport , C. & P. Ry . Co. decided at the present term , 1 SUP . CT . REP . 140 . Many other circumstances may make such an order reasonable , and this case furnishes a striking example . The first default in the payment of interest under the mortgage occurred in October , 1873 . The bondholders did not see fit to take possession , as they had the right to do , when the default had continued for six months . On the contrary , notwithstanding no payments of interest were made , they allowed the company to operate the road and incur obligations therefor until December , 1877 . This was evidently in the hope that their condition would be improved by the delay , for , to effect the forbearance they established an agency and incurred expenses to an amount much larger than the $ 3,000 reimbursed by the company . Prior to the appointment of the receiver the gross earnings do not appear to have been enough to pay expenses , but afterwards they yielded a very considerable surplus . There can not be a doubt that it was for the interest of the bondholders that the road should be kept in operation , and as they did not see fit to take possession while it could only be operated at a loss , it was certainly not an abuse of judicial discretion for the court to order , as a condition of granting their application for a receiver , that debts incurred by the company in thus protecting the security should be paid from the income of the receivership , if , in consequence of an increase of revenue , it could be done .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The income of the receivership , instead of being applied in accordance with the order to pay the debts for the supplies and labor , was used with the consent , and , it may fairly be inferred , at the request , of the bondholders , to buy additional grounds , rolling stock , etc . , and to make permanent improvements , thus adding to the value of the property , which was afterwards sold . There is nothing whatever to indicate that in thus using the income it was the intention of the court to revoke the original order . It seems to have been found , in the administration of the cause , that by using the income to add to the value of the fixed property the interests of all parties would be promoted , and so the fund , which in equity belonged to the labor and supply creditors , was for the time being diverted from them and put into improvements and additions , the proceeds of which are now in court . It is not to be presumed that this diversion would have been authorized if the value of the property added to and improved was not to be correspondingly increased . Clearly , therefore , on the face of the transaction , the fund in court represents in equity the income which belongs to the labor and supply creditors as well as the mortgage security , and there was no impropriety in appropriating it as far as necessary to pay the creditors specially provided for when the receiver was appointed . Such a practice , under proper circumstances , was approved in Fosdick v. Schall , ubi supra , and seems to us eminently just .	@@empty@@	unmatched
There were other questions certified in the case , but as we answer the one which has been particularly stated in the affirmative , and nothing more is needed to sustain the decree , the others will not be considered further than has already been done incidentally .	@@empty@@	unmatched

This appeal is from a decree dismissing the complainant 's bill , and the record discloses the following as the facts material to the determination of the controversy :	@@empty@@	unmatched
The appellees , in 1870 , being British subjects , were owners of letters patent of the United States bearing date January 4 , 1870 , granted to one Dennett , for the term of 17 years from August 13 , 1863 , for an improvement in the construction of concrete arches for building . On November 2 , 1870 , they entered into a written contract with the appellant , an architect , then residing in Albany , New York , but at the time of filing this bill a citizen of California . By this contract the appellees granted to the appellant , his executors , administrators , and assigns , during the residue of the unexpired term of the letters patent , ' full and free liberty , license , and authority to make , use , and sell , or vend to others to be sold , ' the said invention within the divisions of the United States , as thereinafter specified , or one or more of them , in the manner and according to the provisions and agreements thereinafter contained , and upon the payment of the sums of money as therein provided , and not otherwise . For the purposes of the license the territory of the United States was divided into four districts , named , A , B , C , and D , respectively , and a royalty of 10 shillings sterling per square of 100 square feet was to be paid for all work actually done under the patent , and which , from certain specified dates , it was agreed should amount to an annual minimum sum of 500 , and not to be payable in excess of an annual maximum sum of 1,000 in each of such divisions . It was also stipulated that the appellant might surrender the license at any time upon giving six months ' notice , and that the appellees might revoke it upon any default of the appellant after 30 days ' notice . It appears that this contract was entered into after many conversations between the parties , and after a draft agreement had been prepared , and submitted to the appellant for examination . Upon his suggestion it was amended and finally executed .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Various unsuccessful efforts appear to have been made by the appellant while at Albany , and after his removal to San Francisco , and also by one Fuller , who acted as his agent at Albany , to introduce the patent ; and some correspondence took place between the parties in regard to its progress and prospects . This correspondence , as well as the negotiations which led to the execution of the contract , was conducted on the part of the appellees by Frederick Ingle ; and it was to him that the following letter was addressed by the appellant :	@@empty@@	unmatched

' DEAR SIR : It now turns out , just as Mr. Fuller and myself are about to close negotiations for the sale of your patent - right , that I have no power to sell . Will you , therefore , send me the proper papers from your firm , stating that you will not grant licenses to any one else in the United States ? I inclose you an eminent legal opinion thereon . Mr. Fuller had arranged for the sale of Massachusetts , which includes Boston ; but we wait for your proper authority , which must be exclusive , or no value can be attached to the license I hold . Of course I am aware of the understanding which I have stated your firm would not go back on , but then the parties purchasing hold that it is not exclusive . In like manner I am unable to close with parties here for section D. I have had so much trouble with this matter , and now that it appeared to be in a good way to be productive of profit , this annoyance arose . You can , however , remedy it in the way prescribed .	@@empty@@	unmatched

This letter seems to have been received by Ingle , and in reply he sent by cable the following :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' MAY 6 , 1873 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
' Fuller , Architect , Albany , New York :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' Dennett will alter agreement , giving Laver exclusive right .	@@empty@@	unmatched
' ROBERT DENNETT & CO . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
Fuller had evidently written a letter to Ingle , to the same effect , about the same time , for , although it is not contained contained in the record , Ingle 's reply to it , written the day he sent the cable message , was produced and read in evidence . In this letter , dated May 5 , 1873 , he says , referring to the objection to the terms of the license , that ' there is no objection on our part to alter it in any way to suit the requirements of the case . ' He adds : ' You will bear in mind that this lease was granted to Mr. Laver to pay as an annual royalty . If it had been proposed then to purchase out and out , I dare say the terms to the exclusive right would have been more precise ; at any rate , our intention was for Mr. Laver to have the exclusive right , ( in all our negotiations , ) and when the document was signed we looked upon it as so settled , unless he elected to throw it up before certain dates for the respective sections as specified in the agreement . He had the document to examine before signing it , and could have made the objection then . At any rate you will , I think , give us credit for having faithfully carried out both the letter and spirit of the agreement . We have had many applications from parties for permission to work the patent in the United States since October , 1870 , the date of our agreement , but have had to reply in each case that our arrangements as to licensing were made . * * * I shall write to our solicitor , Mr. Van Santvoord & Hauff , of Times Building , Park Row , New York , and instruct him to get whatever you require with regard to the specification . I do n't know in what respect it is incomplete . The agreement can be altered to give any parties who propose to purchase the most absolute rights , on payment of the purchase money of section B. ' He then proceeds , in answer he says to a request to that effect , to give the prices for each division , upon an out and out purchase of a gross sum ; and referring to Laver 's statement that Fuller was on the point of completing the negotiations for division B , he says : ' To faciliate completion of the matter , had you not better write to or see Mr. Van Santvoord , whom we will instruct to give you as much assistance as he can . We could not , of course , undertake any litigation in respect of infringements , after we had disposed of our rights for a fixed sum . ' He says , further : ' Our wishes have always been to give him exclusive rights , and I thought that the agreement expressed as much before you raised the question . At any rate we are willing to alter it to faciliate your negotiations . The question is , how is it to be done ? One plan is for us to send power of attorney out to Mr. Van Santvoord , and tell him to alter the agreement and sign for us . Another , and I think a preferable plan , is to write to him to prepare two fresh copies of agreement , distinctly giving Laver exclusive rights , and referring to the old agreement , which will be thereby canceled . He will them let you see the alterations . One copy must be sent to Laver for signature , and another to us , and on the return you and Van Santvoord can exchange them . You must clearly understand , however , that we shall not consent to any other alterations , or to introduce any fresh clauses . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
On May 9 , 1873 , Ingle wrote to the appellant as follows :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' DEAR SIR : Yours of twenty - ninth Mrach came duly to hand , with inclosures , and I delayed answering it for a week or two , as I was expecting to hear from Mr. Fuller . I have now heard from him , and you no doubt know to what effect . He complains of the agreement not giving you exclusive rights . I think it expressed enough for the purpose contemplated at the time , and you were satisfied with it . At any rate , we intended to give you exclusive rights , and have in all good faith acted up to that intention , inasmuch as we have refused many offers of agency since October , 1870 , the date of our agreement with you . I suppose Mr. Fuller will send you the letter I wrote him in reply ; at any rate I will write him by this post a line requesting him to do so ; then you will see exactly what I propose to do . I may say that I have also by this post instructed Mr. Van Santvoord , our solicitor in New York , to prepare full agreements , giving you exclusive rights , and send them to each of us to be resigned and exchanged ; when this is done they will supersede the others , and I hope will be sufficient for Mr. Fuller 's purpose .	@@empty@@	unmatched
' Speaking generally , our view with regard to this matter is this , ( I mean Dennett 's and my own , ) that we gave you a liberal margin of time to make preliminary arrangements , and asked for only a moderate royalty on each section . You had the option of holding or abandoning up to certain dates . If you had decided to surrender , we should have been losers of two years of valuable time , and should have had all our work to begin over again . As you elected to keep the patent - right , you could hardly expect us to forego the just claims for which we stipulated , after such very liberal reservations in your favor . We do not suppose for a moment that you expect this . We do not wish to press you hardly in the matter , but it is really time now that some tangible return was made to us ; of course , if the section B is sold at once , and the money paid over , as we hope it will be , we forego any claim for royalties already due on that section . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
The chief , if not the only , instance in which it is alleged the defect in the license actually operated to the injury of the appellant , is the loss of the sale of the patent for the New England states ; and as to that the proof wholly fails . The only witness examined on the subject is the appellant himself , who knew nothing of it , except as he learned it from Fuller , his agent ; and his evidence , being hearsay , can not be regarded . The parties with whom the negotiations took place , and who , it is said , refused to proceed after discovering the defect in the license , are not examined nor even named . Fuller , the agent of the appellant , who personally conducted the negotiation , is not examined as a witness at all ; and in his letter to Ingle of June 23 , 1873 , gives an entirely different account of the reasons for the loss of the sale . He there says :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' Your decision not to protect the patent renders it valueless , even if it could not be infringed . The duration of the patent is so short no parties would dream of paying large sums for it . Acting as Mr. Laver 's attorney , I did the best I could to dispose of it for New England states . That is now abandoned unless the patent can be extended . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
There is no proof of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the appellees , and all charges to that effect in the bill are substantially withdrawn by the appellant in his testimony .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is claimed , however , on the part of the appellant , that he has a strict right in equity to the relief prayed for in his bill , on the ground that no contract was ever in fact entered into , the minds of the parties never having met upon the same terms . But there is no foundation for such a contention . The minds of the parties did meet . There was in fact an actual agreement , the terms of which were perfectly well understood by both parties . They acted upon that understanding from the time the instrument was executed ; and when the appellant first discovered that it did not have the legal effect intended , and gave notice to appellees accordingly , there was no controversy between them on the subject . The common intention was at once admitted and the necessary correction promptly offered . There was , no doubt , a mistake , but it was in the instrument which undertook to express the agreement , and not in the agreement itself . It did not relate to any matter of fact which was the basis of the contract , an error in regard to which would be fundamental , and therefore fatal , but affected only the document which professed to express , but did so incorrectly , the actual intention of both parties . It is equally wide of the mark to say , as it was argued , that the contract has failed by reason of the failure of the consideration . The appellant can not say that he did not acquire something by reason of the license , although his right was not , as it was intended to be , exclusive . But , so far as appears in the case , he had the same benefits and advantages he would have enjoyed if the instrument had contained the exclusive grant it was supposed to secure ; for the parties on both sides acted upon that construction , and , as we have already shown , no actual loss is proven to have arisen to the appellant by virtue of the defective assurance .	@@empty@@	unmatched
That the instrument imperfectly expressed the agreement of the parties was not the exclusive fault of the appellees . It was the duty of the appellant to have discovered the error before executing the contract . He did not , in fact , find it out until after two years from its date ; and then , applying for its correction , failed to avail himself of the offer of the appellees , promptly made , in response to his demand to execute a corrected agreement .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The only equity which the appellant could claim was to have the mutual mistaken in the language of the instrument corrected , until some default had occurred on the part of the appellees . But they were in no default . They offered to make the correction as soon as they had notice of the mistake ; but the appellant declined to accept it . After the further lapse of more than six months , he insisted on his right to put an end to the agreement itself . This he was in no position to do . His delay to assert such a claim , if his right had been otherwise better founded , constituted such laches as would , at least , greatly weaken his title to relief , if it did not amount to a bar ; and coupled with the loss to the appellees of the value of their own rights under the patent , which can not be restored , would make it inequitable , as against them , to absolve the appellant from the legal obligation of his contract .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We see no ground in the facts of the case for the application of the principles and authorities invoked by the appellant as a warrant to grant him the relief for which his bill prays . The decree is accordingly affirmed .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Justice Thomas , dissenting from the denial ofcertiorari .	@@empty@@	unmatched
First Amendment rights are all too often sacrificed for the sake of transparency in federal and state elections . “ ‘ Sunlight,’ ” this Court has noted , is “ ‘ the best of disinfectants’ ” in elections . See Buckley v. Valeo , 424 U. S. 1 , 67 ( 1976 ) ( per curiam ) ( quoting L. Brandeis , Other People ’s Money 62 ( 1933 ) ) . But that is not so when “ ‘ sunlight’ ” chills speech by exposing anonymous donors to harassment and threats of reprisal . See Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm’n , 558 U. S. 310 , 482–484 ( 2010 ) ( Thomas , J. , concurring in part and dissenting in part ) ; see also , e.g. , NAACP v. Alabama ex rel . Patterson , 357 U. S. 449 , 462–463 ( 1958 ) . This case presents the opportunity to clarify that the State ’s interest in transparency does not always trump First Amendment rights . I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari .

In 2012 , Delaware Strong Families , a tax - exempt nonprofit organization , produced a “ General Election Values Voter Guide ” for Delaware citizens . The voter guide listed all candidates running for Congress or the state legislature and indicated whether the candidate “ [ s]upport[ed ] , ” “ [ o]pposed , ” or was “ [ u]ndecided ” about various issues . The guide covered issues ranging from candidates’ positions on “ [ g]iving tax dollars to Planned Parenthood ” to “ legalizing Internet gambling . ” Delaware Strong Families , 2012 General Election Values Voter Guide 1–4 , online at http://www.delawarestrong.org / wp - content / uploads /2012/10/2012-C3-General - Election - Voter - Guide - v5.pdf ( as last visited June 23 , 2016 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
As Delaware Strong Families prepared to produce a similar voter guide for the 2014 election cycle , it filed this federal suit challenging Delaware ’s newly enacted disclosure requirements that would require it to reveal many of its donors if it disseminated the voter guide . The Delaware Election Disclosures Act requires “ [ a]ny person other than a candidate committee or political party ” who spends more than $ 500 on “ third - party advertisements . . . during an election period [ to ] file a third - party advertisement report ” with the State Commissioner of Elections . Del. Code Ann . , Tit . 15 , § 8031(a ) ( 2015 ) . A “ ‘ third - party advertisement’ ” includes “ electioneering communication[s ] ” that “ [ r]efe[r ] to a clearly identified candidate ” and are “ pub - licly distributed within 30 days before a primary election . . . or 60 days before a general election to an audience that includes members of the electorate for the office sought by such candidate . ” § § 8002(10)(a ) , 8002(27 ) . The voter guide fits that description . Accordingly , Delaware Strong Families must report the names , addresses , and contribution amounts of not only those donors who earmarked their donations for the creation of the voter guide , but also any and all donors who contributed more than $ 100 to the nonprofit during the election period . § 8031(a)(3 ) ; see Delaware Strong Families v. Attorney General of Delaware , 793 F. 3d 304 , 307 ( CA3 2015 ) ( “ Disclosure is not limited to individuals who earmarked their donations to fund an electioneering communication ” ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The District Court enjoined the Act . The court observed that the Act required disclosure of “ virtually every communication made during the critical time period , no matter how indirect and unrelated it is to the electoral process , ” including a presumptively neutral voter guidepublished by a presumptively neutral , tax - exempt , nonprofit entity . Delaware Strong Families v. Biden , 34 F. Supp . 3d 381 , 395 ( Del. 2014 ) . The court concluded that the relationship between the Act ’s purpose and the First Amendment burdens it imposed was “ too tenuous . ” Ibid .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed . The court held that the Act ’s far - reaching disclosure requirements were sufficiently tailored to Delaware ’s asserted interest in an “ informed electorate . ” 793 F. 3d , at 309–312 . It sufficed that the Act required only those organizations that disseminated communications during “ the applicable ‘ election period’ ” to disclose their donors . Id. , at 312 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This Court has long considered disclosure requirements as “ the least restrictive means of curbing the evils of campaign ignorance and corruption . ” Buckley , 424 U. S. , at 68 . At the same time , the Court has recognized that “ [ i]t is undoubtedly true ” that mandatory disclosure of donor names “ will deter some individuals who otherwise might contribute ” and “ may even expose contributors to harassment or retaliation . ” Ibid . These First Amendment harms justify eliminating disclosure requirements altogether . But even under this Court ’s existing precedents , Delaware ’s scheme is far broader than those the Court has previously upheld .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
In my view , it is time for the Court to reconsider whether a State ’s interest in an informed electorate can ever jus - tify the disclosure of otherwise anonymous donor rolls . As the Court said in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n , 514 U. S. 334 ( 1995 ) , “ [ t]he simple interest in providing voters with additional relevant information does not jus - tify a state requirement that a writer make statementsor disclosures she would otherwise omit . ” Id. , at 348 ; see also i d . , at 360–367 ( Thomas , J. , concurring in judgment ) ( discussing tradition of anonymous speech during the founding era ) ; Doe v. Reed , 561 U. S. 186 , 240 ( 2010 ) ( Thomas , J. , dissenting ) ( “ [ A ] long , unbroken line of this Court ’s precedents holds that privacy of association is protected under the First Amendment ” ) . The same rule should apply here . “ Disclaimer and disclosure requirements enable private citizens and elected officials to implement political strategies specifically calculated to curtail campaign - related activity and prevent the lawful , peaceful exercise of First Amendment rights . ” Citizens United , 558 U. S. , at 483 ( opinion of Thomas , J. ) ( emphasis in original ) ; McConnell v. Federal Election Comm’n , 540 U. S. 93 , 275–276 ( 2003 ) ( Thomas , J. , concurring in part and dissenting in part ) ; see also NAACP , 357 U. S. , at 462 ( noting that disclosure of members’ names would expose them “ to economic reprisal , loss of employment , threat of physical coercion , and other manifestations of public hostility ” ) . Given the specter of these First Amendment harms , a State ’s purported interest in disclosure can not justify revealing the identities of an organization ’s otherwise anonymous donors .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	9
Even if the Court were to evaluate the Disclosures Act by applying its existing framework , the Delaware scheme sweeps far broader than those the Court has previously considered . Disclosure requirements “ can not be justified by a mere showing of some legitimate governmental interest . ” Buckley , 424 U. S. , at 64 . Instead , disclosure requirements must withstand “ exacting scrutiny . ” Ibid . Exacting scrutiny requires the State to establish that “ the disclosure requirement ” is “ substantial[ly ] relat[ed ] ” to “ a sufficiently important governmental interest . ” Citizens United , supra , at 366–367 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ; see also Buckley , supra , at 64–65 ( same ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Here , the Third Circuit ’s “ exacting scrutiny ” analysis compared the finer details of the Disclosures Act with the federal disclosure requirements . 793 F. 3d , at 309–312 . Delaware ’s scheme as applied to Delaware Strong Families , however , bears little resemblance to the federal disclosure requirements that this Court has considered . In Buckley v. Valeo , for example , the Court construed a federal disclosure provision to require disclosure only “ for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate ” to “ insure that the reach of the [ federal provision wa]s not impermissibly broad . ” 424 U. S. , at 80 ( footnote omitted ) . No one contends that Delaware Strong Families’ voter guide ex - pressly advocates for a particular candidate . Later in McConnell v. Federal Election Comm’n , the Court upheld amended federal disclosure requirements as applied to the electioneering communications of “ corporations and labor unions . . . fund[ing ] broadcast advertisements designed to influence federal elections . . . while concealing their identities from the public ” by “ hiding behind dubious and misleading names . ” 540 U. S. , at 196–197 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . The record here contains no evidence of such “ abuse ” or “ tactics . ” Ibid . ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . And finally in Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm’n , the Court concluded that federally required disclosure “ avoid[ed ] confusion by making clear ” to voters that advertisements naming then - Senator Hil - lary Clinton and “ contain[ing ] pejorative references to her candidacy ” were “ not funded by a candidate or political party . ” 558 U. S. , at 368 . But today ’s case involves no such “ pejorative references”—indeed , if the voter guide were anything but neutral , it would threaten Delaware Strong Families’ tax - exempt status .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Perhaps a mere “ interest in an informed electorate , ” 793 F. 3d , at 310 , might justify a more tailored regime ( though I have my doubts ) . But here , the Third Circuit failed to ask how that interest could justify mandatory disclosure merely because an organization mentions a candidate ’s name .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In my view , the purported government interest in an informed electorate can not justify the First Amendment burdens that disclosure requirements impose . See Citizens United , supra , at 483 ( opinion of Thomas , J. ) . But if the Court is determined to stand by its “ exacting scrutiny ” test , then this case is its proving ground . By refusing to review the constitutionality of the Delaware law , the Court sends a strong message that “ exacting scrutiny ” means no scrutiny at all . I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari .

ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Wisconsin .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This is an action by the United States against the Western Union Railroad Company , a corporation of Wisconsin , to recover certain internal revenue taxes alleged to have accrued from Aug. 1 , 1862 , to Dec. 31 , 1871 . The company filed a general denial of the allegations of the complaint , and in addition thereto set up a counter claim .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The plaintiff , to maintain the issue on its part , introduced statements from the books of the defendant , which were admitted to be true , from which it appeared that the gross amount of all receipts of the company for the transportation of passengers between Aug. 1 , 1862 , and July 1 , 1864 , was $ 190,863.68 ; that its entire gross receipts from and after June 30 , 1864 , until Aug. 1 , 1866 , were $ 1,427,685.36 ; that its gross receipts for fares and carrying the mails , from Aug. 1 , 1866 , until Jan. 1 , 1870 , were $ 605,770.09 , and that of the said last amount $ 61,676.01 were for carrying the mails , and $ 544,094.08 for fares .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It further appeared from the books of the company , that there were no net earnings subject to tax in this suit . There were entries crediting the agent of its bondholders with interest on bonds of the Northern Illinois Railroad , from July 1 to Dec. 31 , 1864 , the sum of $ 38,876.00 , and from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31 , 1865 , a like credit to him for interest on said bonds , $ 33,648.54 ; and in the year 1866 a like credit of $ 24,372.25 ; upon which the plaintiff claimed that it was entitled to a tax of five per cent . It further appeared from said books that interest on the bonded debt to the amount of $ 61,495.00 fell due Aug. 1 , 1870 , and was paid by the company on or after that date ; that interest to the amount of $ 53,767.65 on the bonded debt became payable Feb. 1 , 1870 , and was paid on or after that date ; and that $ 52,929.37 became due and payable on the bonds Aug. 1 , 1871 , and was paid on or after that date by the company .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The plaintiff , to further maintain the issue on its part , offered to show by said books that , Feb. 1 , 1872 , the further sum of $ 52,423.71 became due and payable on the said bonds , and was paid on or after said date , to which the defendant objected on the ground that said evidence was incompetent and immaterial . The court overruled the objection and the defendant excepted . The plaintiff then showed that the sum of $ 52,423.71 so became due and payable Feb. 1 , 1872 , and was paid on or after that date , and claimed and insisted that the plaintiff was entitled to a tax of two and a half per centum on five - sixths of said amount .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The plaintiff then rested , and the defendant called as a witness one Ranney , who testified that he was secretary and treasurer of the company and had charge of its books and papers , and he as their bookkeeper had charge of the books of said company from Feb. 22 , 1866 ; that he had examined the company 's books , papers , and files , and found therein no reference to pay contract for carrying the mails ; that so far as he could ascertain from his examination no such contract was ever made , and that he had no knowledge thereof .	@@empty@@	unmatched
He further testified that that portion of the road between Freeport and Savannah was known and called as the Northern Illinois Railroad , and that the bonds mentioned as Northern Illinois Railroad bonds were issued on that road ; that said road was a part of the road operated by the Racine and Mississippi Railroad , and that it was consolidated with the Western Union Railroad in January , 1866 , and that all of the earnings of said road for the whole time mentioned in the declaration are included in the books of the company ; and that on the consolidation of the said company with the Western Union Railroad Company the latter company succeeded to all its rights , privileges , franchises , and liabilities . That the entries in the books of interest paid on bonds of Northern Illinois Railroad , to wit , $ 38,876 , $ 33,648.54 , and $ 24,372.25 , were made to show the relative rights of the bondholders of the different portions of the entire road , and that in fact no interest was ever paid upon such bonds , except the sum of $ 2,360.67 , and that said accounts still remain open and unsettled upon the books , and that there never were any net earnings of said company to pay interest on said bonds , and that no such interest was ever paid ; but at the time of the change of management , July 1 , 1869 , he understood that the said bonds were arranged or settled , but in what way he was unadvised .	@@empty@@	unmatched

No express contract for carrying the mails was proven , but since the service for which the compensation was paid began before August 1 , and was continued without interruption for the whole term in question , the court below implied a contract prior to that time . This , we think , was right . Had payment been refused and suit brought against the United States in the Court of Claims , to recover for the service rendered , there could be no doubt about the right to recover , notwithstanding the jurisdiction of that court is confined to suits on contracts ( Salomon v. United States , 19 Wall . 17 ) ; and this not alone because the service had been rendered , but because it is to be presumed that when the company commenced the transportation it had been agreed that payment should be made for what was done .	@@empty@@	unmatched
3 . As to whether taxes are payable on interest falling due Aug. 1 , 1870 , at the rate of five per cent or two and a half per cent .	@@empty@@	unmatched

4 . As to the tax on interest due and payable Feb. 1 , 1872 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The act of 1870 ( 16 Stat . 260 , sect . 15 ) provided ' that there hall be levied and collected for and during the year 1871 a tax of two and one half per centum on the amount of all interest or coupons paid on bonds or other evidences of debt issued and payable in one or more years after date , by any ' railroad company , ' and on the amount of all dividends of earnings , income , or gains hereafter declared , ' ' whenever and wherever the same shall be payable , . . . and on all undivided profits . . . which have accrued and been earned and added to any surplus , contingent , or other fund . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
The interest in this case was neither payable nor paid in 1871 , and as the tax is not leviable or collectible until the interest is payable , we see no way in which the company can be charged on this account . The tax is not on the interest as it accrues , but when it is paid . No provision is made for a pro rata distribution of the burden over the time the interest is accumulating , and as the tax can only be levied for and during the year 1871 , we think , if the interest is in good faith not payable in that year , the tax is not demandable , either in whole or in part .	@@empty@@	unmatched
There is no question here of earnings , for the finding is not as to what was earned by the company during the year 1871 , but as to what was paid in 1872 on account of interest then for the first time falling due . We are aware that at the present term we held , in Railroad Company v. Collector ( 100 U.S. 595 ) , that the tax levied under the act now in question was essentially a tax on the business of the corporation , and that in order to secure its payment it was laid on the subjects to which the earnings were to be applied in the usual course of business , but as this tax could not be levied until 1872 , and there is no finding of any earnings in 1871 , we see nothing to be taxed under that rule . In Barnes v. Railroad Companies ( 17 Wall . 309 ) it appeared expressly that the dividends were declared out of the earnings of 1869 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It follows that to the extent of $ 1,092.16 , and the interest thereon , the judgment below was wrong , but in all other respects right .

The decision of this case turns upon the construction of the powers conferred by the will on the trustees named in it .	@@empty@@	unmatched
As this question of power is the principal one in the case , a critical examination of the terms of the will as connected with the condition of the trust estate and of the cestuis que trust , at the time of the execution of the deed , becomes necessary .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The will begins by a declaration that the testator gives , devises , and bequeaths all of his estate , real , personal , and mixed , of whatever kind it may be , and wherever situated , to William A. Bradley , Jr. , his son , and A. Thomas Bradley , his cousin , and to the survivor and his heirs in trust . Then follows the distinct declaration of these trusts , the first of which is of the house in which he lived , and its furniture , and one - third of the net income of his estate besides , to his wife during her life . He next directs that the trustees shall divide all his estate immediately after his death into four equal parts , and allot them as follows : One part to his son William , who shall receive his portion at once ; one to the children then living or thereafter born to said William ; one to Mrs. Linton , a married daughter ; and one to Mrs. Edelin , another married daughter . The portions left to the two daughters were to include the homestead , for which each of them was to be charged $ 5,000 in dividing the property ; ' and the trustees or the survivor of my said trustees shall also take into possession the said household effects and other chattels , and make , according to his or their best judgments , an equal distribution of the same in kind as to the whole or in part as to some , and in proceeds of sales as to others , among the parties entitled to real estate under this will , and in the same proportions . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
He next directed the trustees to hold the portions of his daughters in trust for their sole and separate use , free from the control of their husbands and from liability for their debts ; and he provided for such disposition of their respective shares on their death that all the interest of both of them , and in fact all the beneficial interests under the will , had vested in the children of William A. Bradley , Jr. , at the time the deed to Young was made by A. Thomas Bradley . This resulted from the death of each daughter childless , and the death of testator 's wife and son .	@@empty@@	unmatched
By the unanimous request of the persons interested under the will , no division into four parts and no distribution of the estate was ever made . As we have already said , by reason of the death of all the beneficiaries under the will except the children of W. A. Bradley , Jr. , and by the payment of all the debts of the testator , the entire interest in the estate of the testator had become vested in them ; and , under these circumstances , the inquiry is , hat authority had the surviving trustee to sell real estate .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The legal title , it is argued , is vested in him by the will . The power conferred by item second is as ample as language can make it , with the single limitation that it is subject to the trusts of the will . The estate vested in the trustees was designed to enable them to execute these trusts . It was not an estate to last for ever . The things to be done by the trustees were defined , and in the nature of things were to have an end .	@@empty@@	unmatched
What were the purposes for which this trust was created , and what remained for a trustee to do in execution of them ?	@@empty@@	unmatched
1 . They were to hold for the benefit of the widow , during her life , and see that she received the one - third of the annual income of his estate . She is long since dead , and that trust has ceased .	@@empty@@	unmatched
2 . We may suppose that in making the partition and distribution , sales to equalize , and conveyance to the distributees were necessary . The whole interest has become vested in one of the four distributees of the will , and nothing remains to be done under the trust in regard to that distribution .	@@empty@@	unmatched
3 . The trustees were to hold the shares of the daughters as a protection against their husbands , and for the children of these daughters until the youngest of such children should attain the age of twenty - one years , unless in the discretion of the trustees it should appear best to terminate the trust earlier . There were no such children of the daughters , and the daughters are both dead .	@@empty@@	unmatched
There was no such control over the distributive shares of the children of W. A. Bradley , Jr. , and as the whole of it has come to them , the trustees are not their trustees as they were of the widow of the testator , his daughters , and their children if there had been such .	@@empty@@	unmatched
These are all the trusts declared by the will . They were all performed , superseded , or terminated before the deed to Young was made . The trustee in making that deed was discharging no trust reposed in him and no duty required of him by the will . It is not suggested anywhere that any such purpose was in view . It is said that the property was dilapidated and needed repair . But as it belonged to Mrs. Bradley and her children , and as the will did not confer on the trustees any guardianship or control over the property of the testator 's son 's children after their share was allotted to them , the trustees had no power over it when it came to them by the other provisions of the will on the death of the other devisees .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The doctrine is well settled that , whatever the language by which the trust estate is vested in the trustee , its nature and duration are governed by the requirements of the trust . If that requires a fee - simple estate in the trustee , it will be created , though the language be not apt for that purpose . If the language conveys to the trustee and his heirs for ever , while the trust requires a more limited estate either in quantity or duration , only the latter will vest .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Mr. Perry , in his work on Trusts , supports by a very full array of authorities these two propositions in regard to the construction of instruments out of which trust estates arise : 1 ' Whenever a trust is created , a legal estate sufficient for the purposes of the trust shall , if possible , be implied in the trustee , whatever may be the limitations in the instrument , whether to him and his heirs or not . ' 2 . ' Although a legal estate may be limited to a trustee to the fullest extent , as to him and his heirs , yet it shall not be carried further than the complete execution of the trust necessarily requires . ' Perry , Trusts , sect . 312 . Again , he says : ' In the United States , the distinction between deeds and wills in respect to the trustee 's estate has not been kept up ; and the general rule is , that whether words of inheritance in the trustee are or are not in the deed , the trustee will take an estate adequate in the execution of the trust , and no more nor less . ' Sect . 320 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The case of Noble v. Andrews ( 37 Conn. 346 ) bears a strong analogy to the one before us in principle , where it was held that a gift to a person in trust for a wife during her life , and to her heirs for ever , subject to her husband 's curtesy , conveyed to the trustee only an estate for the life of the wife , and at her death the trust ceased .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This subject is considered and the authorities fully reviewed by Mr. Justice Swayne , in Doe , Lessee of Poor , v. Considine , 6 Wall . 458 . ' It is well settled , ' says he , ' that where no intention to the contrary appears , the language used in creating the estate will be limited and restrained to the purposes of its creation . And when they are satisfied , the estate of the trustee ceases to exist and his title becomes extinct . The extent and duration of the estate are measured by the objects of its creation . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
We are satisfied that , at the time A. Thomas Bradley undertook to sell to Mark Young the property in controversy , the trust estate created in him by the will of William A. Bradley , Sen. , had become extinct , and that his conveyance was void because his powers as such trustee had ceased .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Two minor objections are taken to the decree which require notice .	@@empty@@	unmatched
1 . It is said that the amount charged to Young for the use and occupation of the property is excessive . It is a sufficient answer to this to say that the matter was referred to an auditor , on whose report the decree in that respect was based , and that no exception was taken to his report .	@@empty@@	unmatched
2 . It is alleged for error also that no provision is made by the decree to refund to Young the purchase - money , amounting to about $ 10,000 , paid by him under the contract . At first blush , this demand of Young to have his money or the property seems just .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The court below seemed to be impressed with this view of the matter , for in the order of reference to the auditor , who in that court performs the functions of a master in chancery , he was directed to report ' how much , if any , of the money paid by said Mark Young to A. Thomas Bradley went to the benefit and advantage of the complainants . ' And he reported that none of it did . To this branch of the report there was no exception , though an effort was made , after the time for it had passed , to except to other parts of the report . So that we are concluded by that report .	@@empty@@	unmatched
But in the view we have taken of the case the sale by Bradley was utterly void . The complainants are entitled to their property and compensation for its use , and the matter of the return of the money to Young is one solely between Bradley and him , with which these complainants have nothing to do . It is not the rescission of a valid contract , in which case the parties must be placed in statu quo , but the recovery of property held on a void deed with a declaration of its original nullity .	@@empty@@	unmatched

MR . JUSTICE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This was a bill in equity , involving , amongst other questions , the validity of a trust deed given by the complainant ( the appellee here ) to secure certain notes . The complainant charges in his bill that he was so intoxicated when he executed the deed and notes as to be incapable of understanding what he was doing . The court below , after considerable testimony had been tak n , directed an issue to try the question whether the complainant , at the time of the execution of the deed of trust and notes , was capable of executing a valid deed or contract . The issue so directed was tried , and resulted in a verdict for the complainant ; namely , that he was not capable of executing a valid deed or contract . The defendants took a bill of exceptions to the charge given by the judge who tried the issue , which was allowed , and signed by him . The cause afterwards came on to be heard upon the exceptions , and they were overruled . Subsequently a final hearing was had upon the pleadings , evidence , and verdict , and a decree was rendered for the complainant , directing the trust deed and notes in question to be vacated and set aside . From that decree this appeal was taken , and the only errors assigned are to the charge given by the judge to the jury on the trial of the feigned issue .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This is totally inadmissible . A bill of exceptions can not be taken on the trial of a feigned issue directed by a court of equity , or , if taken , can only be used on a motion for a new trial made to said court . 2 Dan . Ch . Pr . ( 3d Am . ed . ) 1106 ; Armstrong v. Armstrong , 3 Myl . & K. 52 ; Ex parte Story , 12 Pet . 343 . See the cases on new trials on feigned issues collected in 3 Graham & Waterman on New Trials , 1553 , & c. The issue is directed to be tried for the purpose of informing the conscience of the Chancellor , and aiding him to come to a proper conclusion . If he thinks the trial has not been a fair one , or for any other reason desires a new trial , it is in his discretion to order it . But he may proceed with the cause though dissatisfied with the verdict , and make a decree contrary thereto , if in his judgment the law and the evidence so requires . A decree in equity , therefore , when appealed from , does not stand or fall according to the legality or illegality of the proceedings on the trial of a feigned issue in the cause ; for the verdict may or may not have been the ground of the decree . It is the duty of the court of first instance to decide ( as was done here ) upon the whole case , pleadings , evidence , and verdict , giving to the latter so much effect as it is worth . An appeal from the decree must be decided in the same way , namely , upon the whole case , and can not be made to turn on the correctness or incorrectness of the judge 's rulings at the trial of the feigned issue .	@@empty@@	unmatched
MR . JUSTICE CLIFFORD concurred in the judgment of the court , and delivered the following opinion:	@@empty@@	unmatched
Difficulty attends the effort to define , with clearness and precision , what degree of mental unsoundness in a grantor is sufficient , in contemplation of law , to render him incapable of giving a valid and effectual deed of conveyance . Confirmed insanity which deprives a person of mental capacity to distinguish between right and wrong , in respect to the act in question , renders the person irresponsible for such an act , though criminal , and disqualifies him to enter into a contract or to execute a valid instrument to convey real or personal estate .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Deeds made by such a person are at least voidable ; but mere weakness of understanding is not of itself any objection to the validity of a contract , if the capacity remains to see things in their true relations , and to form correct conclusions in respect to the subject - matter of the contract .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Men of such understanding are held responsible for criminal acts , and they may make valid contracts ; but when it appears that a contractor or grantor has not strength of mind and reason sufficient to understand the nature and consequences of his act in making a contract or in executing a deed , the instrument may be avoided , on the ground of the mental incapacity of the party to contract or to execute the conveyance .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Both minds must meet in such a transaction ; and if one is so weak , unsound , and diseased that the party is incapable of understanding the nature and quality of the act to be performed , or its consequences , he is incompetent to assent to the terms a d conditions of the instrument , whether that state of his mind was produced by mental or physical disease , and whether it resulted from ordinary sickness , or from accident , or from debauchery , or from habitual and protracted intemperance .

Enough appears to show that the complainant owned lot numbered twenty - six , described in the record , with the two dwelling - houses erected thereon ; that on the 3d of February , 1871 , he indorsed two notes of that date , each for the sum of three hundred dollars , payable one in five and the other in six months from date , with ten per cent interest , to the order of the first - named respondent ; and that he , on the same day , executed and delivered to the other respondent a deed of conveyance of the houses and lot in trust to suffer and permit the complainant to occupy and enjoy the premises until some default made in the payment of those two promissory notes , with power in the trustee , in case of default of payment , to proceed , on the request of the payee of the notes , to sell the premises . Default of payment of the first note was made , and complainant alleges , in his original bill of complaint , that the trustee threatens to sell the premises . Subsequently he , by leave of court , filed an amended bill of complaint .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Reference will only be made to the amended bill , as the matters in controversy arose out of charges contained in that pleading , which are as follows : That when the complainant executed the deed of trust and the notes he was so intoxicated that he did not know what he was doing ; that he did not know that he was making his property liable for the notes , or that he was incurring any obligation to pay the notes ; that the trustee , on the 21st of September last , sold the property at public auction to the payee of the notes , and that he claims the property as his own , and has given the complainant notice to leave the premises .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Based upon these allegations , and others not necessary to be reproduced , the complainant prays as follows : 1 . That the sale to the payee of the notes may be annulled and set aside . 2 . That the trustee may be enjoined and restrained from making any conveyance of the premises to any person . 3 . That if the trustee has made any conveyance of the same , that the conveyance may be annulled and set aside . 4 . That the deed of trust may be decreed null and void . 5 . That the payee of the notes may be enjoined and restrained from taking possession , or in any way interfering with the premises or with the complainant , or any tenant thereof , in the free use and enjoyment of the property ; and for general relief .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Process was issued ; and the first - named respondent appeared and filed a separate answer , which consists of a denial of every allegation of the bill of complaint , together with two affirmative averments : 1 . That the complainant several times asked for extension of time for the payment of the notes . 2 . That he , the respondent , saw no signs of intoxication in the complainant at the time the notes and deed of trust were executed , and that he never set up any such pretence before the first note was sued .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Proofs were taken , and it appears that the cause was submitted to the court upon the pleadings and evidence without argument . Before decision , the court directed that a feigned issue should be tried by a jury in the law court of the District , as follows , to wit : whether or not the complainant at the time the deed of trust and notes were executed was capable of executing a valid deed or contract .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Pending that proceeding , the complainant filed in the equity court a supplemental bill , in which he alleged that the jury empanelled to try the feigned issue failed to agree , and that the issue was still pending in the law court ; that the payee of the notes brought suit against him before a justice of the peace to obtain possession of the premises ; that he recovered judgment in the case , and that the present complainant appealed the same to the Supreme Court of the District that the appellee in that suit , notwithstanding the pendency of the feigned issue in the court of law , caused the appeal from the judgment rendered by the justice of the peace to the docketed and affirmed , without evidence or inquiry into the merits . Wherefore he prayed that the writ of possession might be annulled and set aside , and for an injunction .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Instead of that , the court first issued a summons commanding the respondents to appear and answer the allegations of the supplemental bill . Service being made , the first - named respondent appeared and filed an answer , in which he admits that the complainant did set up the defence of intoxication in the suit on the note ; that he , the present respondent , did obtain judgment for possession ; but he avers that the appeal was never perfected , and that the judgment of the justice of the peace was affirmed . Hearing was had ; and the court awarded an injunction restraining the respondent from interfering with the property , but requiring the complainant to give bond to pay rent , in case the final decree should be in favor of the respondent .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Those matters being adjusted , the parties went to trial upon the feigned issue in the court of law , and the jury found that the complainant at the time he signed the deed of trust and notes was not capable of executing a valid deed or contract . Exceptions were filed by the respondent as in a common - law action , in which is given what purports to be the testimony introduced in the trial of the issue .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Evidence was offered by the plaintiff tending to prove that at and after the time of the making of the deed and notes , he , the plaintiff , was in the habit of using intoxicating liquors to excess ; that he was more or less under such stimulants all the time ; that at the date of the deed he had been drinking freely ; and the bill of exceptions shows that several witnesses testified that they did not consider him fit to do business . Among others , the makers of the notes secured by the deed of trust were called , and they testified that they were present at the making of the deed and notes ; that the complainant was very much intoxicated , so much so that they did not consider him fit to transact business or capable of executing a deed or contract . Testimony to the same effect was given by another witness who was also present when the deed and notes were executed .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Support to that theory , of a decided character , was also derived from the testimony of a physician , who testified that he saw the party almost daily about that time , and ' that he was not competent to contract at the time of making the deed , ' in which statements he was confirmed by other witnesses called during the trial .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Opposing evidence was introduced by the defendant . In the first place , he called the trustee who prepared the deed and notes , and he testified that the parties , including the makers of the notes , came to his office to have the deed prepared ; that he informed him that he must have the title - deed of the plaintiff to obtain the description of the premises ; that the plaintiff and the payee of the notes left his office for that purpose , and returned with the title - deed ; that he prepared the trust - deed , read it over to the plaintiff , and explained it to him ; that he expressed himself satisfied with it , and signed it . He also called the magistrate who took the acknowledgment of the grantor ; and both of these witnesses testified that they thought that the grantor was sober . Witnesses were also examined by the defendant , whose testimony tended to prove that the plaintiff said nothing of the deed being invalid because of his intoxication before the property was sold , and that he signed a paper six weeks afterwards , agreeing to the assignment of the lease for which the notes secured by the deed of trust were given .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Three exceptions were taken by the defendant to rulings of the presiding justice in refusing to instruct the jury as requested , as follows : 1 . That , to set aside a deed or contract on account of drunkenness , it is not sufficient that the party is under undue excitement from liquor . It must rise to that degree which may be called excessive drunkenness , where the party is utterly deprived of his reason and understanding . 2 . That the jury must find for the defendants , unless they believe that the plaintiff was in such a state of intoxication as not to know what he was doing when he signed the deed in controversy . 3 . That , if the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff knew that he was signing a deed of trust upon his property , they must find for the defendant .	@@empty@@	unmatched
By the record , it appears that the judge held that if the word ' utterly ' in the first prayer as here reported was intended to express an entire loss of reason in all respects , it was not good law ; but if it meant that the defendant must be incapable of understanding the terms and conditions of the deed of trust , in order to avoid it , then it was good law ; and , so modified , the instruction was given to the jury . That the other two requests were granted subject to the following modification : that it was not sufficient to make the deed a valid one for the plaintiff to know that he was signing a deed of trust on his property ; but he must have been in such a condition of mind as to be able to know and understand the terms and condition of the deed . That it is not necessary , in order to render the deed of the plaintiff invalid , that , at the time of its execution and acknowledgment , he was entirely demented by intoxicating drink ; but his act will be rendered invalid if he was in such a condition of mind that he could not comprehend what were the terms and condition of the instrument .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Subsequently the parties were heard on the exceptions in the equity court , and the exceptions were overruled . Neither party moving for a rehearing or a new trial , the cause came up for consideration in the Supreme Court of the District , and the court affirmed the decree of the Chancellor , overruling the exceptions of the defendant to the rulings of the justice presiding at the trial before the jury .	@@empty@@	unmatched
All interlocutory matters having been disposed of , the cause came on to be heard upon the original bill , the amended and supplemental bills , the answers of the respondent , the verdict of the jury , the decree in general term overruling the exceptions to the ruling of the justice in the trial of the feigned issue ; and , upon consideration thereof , it is ordered , adjudged , and decreed that the deed of trust and the indorsements of the complainant on the notes are hereby vacated , annulled , and set aside , and for the other relief , as more fully set forth in the interlocutory decree exhibited in the record , which was in all things affirmed by the final decree of the Supreme Court of the District , from which the respondent appealed to this court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Erroneous rulings of the judge presiding in the trial of feigned issues are the proper subject of a motion for new trial before the Chancellor who formed the issues and sent them to the law court for trial , but they do not of themselves constitute a ground of appeal to this court . Appeals here can only be sustained where the decree is final , and such an appeal brings up the whole case . Where exceptions are taken on the trial of an issue out of chancery , and made part of the record , the certificate to the verdict by the court of law is a certificate to the whole record , and the exceptions , though not expressly certified , become a part of the chancery record . 2 Dan .

Power to grant a new trial of the issues is unquestionably vested in the Chancellor ; but , in determining that matter , the practice is to consider the whole of the evidence given at or before the trial and what has since become known to the court ; and the rule is , that if the court is satisfied that full and omplete justice has been done between the parties , the motion for new trial will be denied . 2 Dan .

Imbecility of mind is not of itself sufficient to set aside a contract , when there is not an essential privation of the reasoning faculties or an incapacity of understanding and acting with discretion in the ordinary affairs of life . Weakness of understanding may be a material circumstance in every case where the charge is that one of the contracting parties has taken undue advantage of the other , or has een guilty of unfair practice or imposition . Formerly , it was considered that intoxication was no excuse for the non - fulfilment of a pecuniary liability , and that it constituted no sufficient plea in avoidance of a contract ; but it is now settled , says Chancellor Kent , according to the dictate of good sense and common justice , that a contract made by a person so destitute of reason as not to know the consequences of his contract , though his incompetency be produced by intoxication , is at least void . 2 Kent , Com . ( 12th ed . ) 451 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Much consideration was given to that question in the case of Barret v. Burton , 2 Aik . ( Vt . ) 167 , and it was there decided that an obligation executed by a man deprived of the exercise of his understanding , by intoxication , was voidable by himself , though the intoxication was voluntary and not procured by the circumvention of the other party . Young v. Stevens , 48 N. H. 136 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Other courts and text - writers of the highest authority adopt that view , and support the proposition without qualification , except where the contract was for necessaries , or where the intoxicated party keeps the goods and uses the same as his own property after he becomes sober . It appears to have been at one time considered , says Chitty , that an agreement was not void even in equity , although it was entered into by the party charged thereon while he was in a state of absolute intoxication , unless such intoxication had been occasioned by the contrivance of the other party , or some positive fraud had been practised ; but it would seem , says the author , that , on principle , such a degree of intoxication as entirely deprives a party of the use of his reason must avoid an engagement entered into by him while in that state , even although it was produced by his own folly , and although no actual fraud was intended or practised ; giving the same reason for the conclusion given at a much earlier period , that ' such a person had no agreeing mind , ' which of itself is sufficient to show that the intoxicated man can not be held bound to the alleged contract .

Beyond doubt , these authorities support the proposition advanced ; and the same wri er adds , that it is now settled that where a party , when he enters into a contract , is in such a state of intoxication as not to know what he is doing , and particularly when it appears that this was known to the other party , his contract is at least voidable .

When intoxication goes so far as absolutely to destroy the reason , it is evident that it renders the person in that state incapable of contracting so long as it continues , since it renders him incapable of giving consent . 1 Poth . on Obl . , by Evans , p. 29 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Modern text - writers treat of contracts with intoxicated persons under a distinct head ; and Addison says , that a party who makes a contract in such a state of intoxication as not to know what he is doing , can not be compelled to perform the contract by the other party who knew him to be in that state , and that a man who takes an obligation from another so circumstanced is guilty of actual fraud . Examples are given which support the proposition ; but the author holds that a contract made by a man in a state of intoxication is voidable only and not void , and therefore the intoxicated man may , if he pleases , when he becomes sober , ratify it , and that it will then be binding .

Undoubtedly , said the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania , the total drunkenness of the maker of a note when he executed it , if known to the payee , rendered it void as to the latter ; and they remark , that the old rule that a man should be held liable upon a contract made by him when in a state of intoxication , on the ground that he should not be allowed to stultify himself , has been long since exploded , and that it is now settled , according to the dictate of good sense and common justice , that a contract made by a person so destitute of reason as not to know the consequences of his contract , though his incompetency be produced by intoxication , is void as between the parties .

Except where the contract is for necessaries , the Court of Exchequer held , that where the right of action is grounded upon a specific , distinct contract , requiring the assent of both parties , and one of them is incapable of assenting , as in consequence of intoxication , in such a case there can be no binding contract . Parke , B. , said , where the party , when he entered into the contract , was in such a state of drunkenness as not to know what he is doing , and particularly when it appears that this was known to the other party , the contract is void altogether , and he can not be compelled to perform it ; adding , that a person who takes an obligation from another under such circumstances is guilty of actual fraud .

In regard to drunkenness , says Greenleaf , it is now settled that incapacity from that cause is a valid defence to an action upon the contract made while under its influence , as well where it was voluntary and by the fault of the defendant as where it was caused by the fraud or procurement of the plaintiff . 2 Greenl . Evid . ( 12th ed . ) sect . 374 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Whether the intoxication was so great as to suspend or destroy the power of intelligent assent , is a question of fact . Nor does it make any difference that the drunkenness was voluntary and wilful , for the legal theory is , that , without the capacity of giving a deliberate assent , no contract can be made . Story on Contr . ( 5th ed . ) 86 .

The questions are whether respondent 's petition for an arrangement of its unsecured debts under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act , 11 U.S.C.A. § 701 et seq . , should be dismissed because the relief obtainable under that chapter is inadequate , and whether the Securities and Exchange Commission is entitled to raise and litigate that question by intervention and appeal .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Respondent , a New Jersey corporation doing business in New York as owner of and manager of real estate investments , has outstanding 900,000 shares of capital stock without par value , which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and are stated by respondent to be held by some seven thousand stockholders . It has liabilities of $ 5,051,416 , of which only $ 74,916 is current . This indebtedness includes two series of publicly held debentures aggregating $ 2,339,000 , maturing January 1 , 1944 , which are secured by a pledge of corporate stock of little value and a $ 3,000,000 note , due August 12 , 1939 , which is secured by a first mortgage owned by respondent . In addition respondent is also liable as a guarantor of payment , principal and interest , and sinking fund of mortgage certificates in the sum of $ 3,710,500 , issued by its wholly owned subsidiary Trinity Building Corporation of New York and now in the hands of some nine hundred holders . These certificates have been in default for failure to pay interest , principal and sinking fund since January 1 , 1939 . They are secured by mortgage of real estate and buildings which are Trinity 's only substantial assets . Each year since 1936 respondent has suffered a net loss in the conduct of its business and is now unable to pay its debts as they mature . 1	@@empty@@	unmatched
Before maturity of the first mortgage certificates , respondent and the Trinity Company joined in proposing to certificate holders a plan for the modification of the obligation of the certificates , leaving unaffected the other indebtedness and stock of respondent . By this plan the maturity of the certificates was to be extended , the rate of interest reduced , and the terms of the provisions for payment of the sinking fund modified . Respondent 's guarantee , as to the extension and interest was to be modified accordingly , and its guarantee of sinking fund payments was to be eliminated . The plan was to be consummated by resort to two proceedings , one to be instituted by respondent under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act , 11 U.S.C.Supp . V , § 701 et seq . , 52 Stat . 840 , 905 , 11 U.S.C.A. § 701 et seq . , for an ' arrangement ' modifying its guarantee of the certificates in the manner already indicated . The other was to be instituted on behalf of Trinity in the New York state courts under the Burchill Act , New York Real Property Law , Consol . Laws , c. 50 , § § 121123 , to secure the appropriate modification of Trinity 's primary obligation on the certificates . The plan provided that modification of respondent 's guarantee by the Chapter XI proceeding should stand , even though the state court should refuse to confirm the proposed modification of Trinity 's obligation on the certificates . When the assent to the plan of holders of certificates amounting to approximately 55 per cent . in number and amount , had been obtained , the present proceeding was gegun May 31 , 1939 , by the filing in the district court for Southern New York of a petition praying that the proposed ' arrangement ' affecting the unsecured indebtedness of respondent be approved .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The district court found that the petition was properly filed 2 under § 322 of Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act , and directed that respondent debtor continue in possession of the property . On July 18 , 1939 , the district court entered an order permitting the Securities and Exchange Commission to intervene . The motions of the Commission to vacate the order approving the debtor 's petition , to dismiss the proceeding under Chapter XI , and to deny confirmation of the proposed arrangement , were denied by the district court and the cause was referred to a referee for further proceedings . On appeal by the Commission from these several orders and on appeal of the respondent from the order of the district court permitting the Commission to intervene , the appeals being consolidated and heard together , the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the order permitting the Commission to intervene and dismissed the appeal of the Commission . 108 F.2d 794 . We granted certiorari April 1 , 1940 , the questions raised bring of public importance in the administration of the Bankruptcy Act . 309 U.S. 649 , 60 S.Ct . 724 , 84 L.Ed . - .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court of Appeals held that the proceeding to secure approval of the arrangement , embodied in the plan proposed by respondent , was properly brought under Chapter XI of theBankruptcy Act ; that the intervention by theCommission was not authorized by any provision of the Bankruptcy Act and that it had no interest affected by the proceeding under that chapter entitling it to intervene under the applicable rules controlling intervention in the federal courts , and that consequently it was not aggrieved by the order appealed from and so was not entitled to maintain its appeal .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Commission argues that Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act prescribes the exclusive procedure for reorganization of a large corporation having its securities outstanding in the hands of the public such as respondent , 3 and that consequently the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain respondent 's petition under Chapter XI ; that in any case the district court should have dismissed the petition because in the circumstances no fair and equitable arrangement affecting respondent 's unsecured creditors alone such as is prescribed by Chapter XI , can be consummated in a proceeding under that chapter . Such being the status of the cause under Chapter XI , the Commission insists that it was properly allowed to intervene in order to protect the interest of the public specially committed to its guardianship by the provisions of Chapter X , and to forestall the impairment of its own functions under that chapter by an unauthorized or improper resort by respondent to Chapter XI , and that for the same reason the Commission was entitled to appeal from the order of the district court refusing to dismiss the Chapter XI proceedings .	@@empty@@	unmatched
To this it is answered , as the Court of Appeals held , that respondent , although a large corporation with its securities widely distributed in the hands of the public , is nevertheless within the literal terms of Chapter XI , which unqualifiedly authorizes a debtor to petition under that chapter for an arrangement with respect of its unsecured indebtedness , and that the district court was accordingly bond to entertain the petition , however desirable it might be that the reorganization should proceed under Chapter X , whose procedure is better adapted in cases like the present to protect the public interest and to secure a fair and equitable reorganization , than are the provisions of Chapter XI .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Chapter XI provides a summary procedure by which a debtor may secure judicial confirmation of an ' arrangement ' of his unsecured debts . The debtor who is defined as a ' person who could become a bankrupt under section 4(22 ) of the Act ( title ) ' , § 306(3 ) , may , according to sections 4 and 1(23 ) , 11 U.S.C.A. § § 22 and 1(23 ) , be any person ( which includes corporations ) , except a municipal , railroad , insurance or banking corporation or a building and loan association . The debtor files his original voluntary petition for an arrangement in such a court as would have jurisdiction of a petition in ordinary bankruptcy 4 and must file with the petition the proposed arrangement . § § 322 , 323 . An arrangement is defined as ' any plan of a debtor for the settlement , satisfaction , or extension of the time of payment of his unsecured debts , upon any terms . ' § 306(1 ) . The unsecured debtors may be treated generally or in classes . § § 356 , 357 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is evident that the language of the sections to which we have referred in terms confers on the court jurisdiction of a petition for an arrangement , which the present petition is , filed by a debtor , which the respondent is , in the technical sense that it confers on the court power to make orders in the cause which are not open to collateral attack . See Pennsylvania v. Williams , 294 U.S. 176 , 180 et seq . , 55 S.Ct . 380 , 382 , 79 L.Ed . 841 , 96 A.L.R. 1166 . But the Commission points out that a proceeding begun under Chapter X may be begun and continued under that chapter only if the petition is filed in good faith , § § 130(7 ) , 143 , 146(2 ) , 221 , and that under § 146(2 ) ' a petition shall be deemed not to be filed in good faith if * * * ( 2 ) adequate relief would be obtainable by a debtor 's petition under the provisions of chapter XI ( 11 ) ' ; that Chapter X , devised as a substitute for the equity receivership , is specially adapted to the reorganization of large corporations whose securities are held by the public , and sets up a special procedure for the protection of widely scattered security holders and the public through the intervention of the Commission , while Chapter XI which is peculiarly adapted to the speedy composition of debts of small individual and corporate businesses , omits the machinery for reorganization set up by Chapter X , and contains no provision for participation by the Commission in a proceeding under Chapter XI . From this it argues that the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain respondent 's petition under Chapter XI , and the readjustment of its indebtedness through judicial action can properly proceed only with the safeguards , public and private , afforded by Chapter X.	@@empty@@	unmatched
While we do not doubt that in general , as will presently appear more in detail , the two chapters were specifically devised to afford different procedures , the one adapted to the reorganization of corporations with complicated debt structures and many stockholders , the other to composition of debts of small individual business and corporations with few stockholders , we find in neither chapter any definition or classification which would enable us to say that a corporation is small or large , its security holders few or many , or that its securities are ' held by the public ' , so as to place the corporation exclusively within the jurisdiction of the court under one chapter rather than the other . But granting the jurisdiction of the court , the question remains of the propriety , in the circumstances , of its order retaining jurisdiction , and of the extent of its duty to go forward with the proceeding under Chapter XI in the face of the contention that Chapter X alone affords a remedy adequately protecting the public and private interests involved . The answer turns not on the court 's statutory jurisdiction to entertain a proceeding under Chapter XI , but on considerations growing out of the public policy of the Act found both in its legislative history and in an analysis of its terms , and of the authority of the court clothed with equity powers and sitting in bankruptcy to give effect to that policy through its power to withhold relief under Chapter XI when relief is available under Chapter X , which is adequate and more consonant with that policy .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Before the enactment of Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act , 48 Stat . 911 , 912 , 11 U.S.C.A. § 207 , the bankruptcy mechanism was designed for the final liquidation of the bankrupt 's estate , except to the extent only that a compromise with creditors was authorized by § § 12 , 74 , 11 U.S.C.A. § § 30 , 202 . Bankruptcy afforded no facilities for corporation reorganization which , in consequence , could be effected only through resort to the equity receivership with its customary mortgage foreclosures and its attendant paraphernalia of creditors ' and security holders ' committees , and of rival reorganization plans . Lack of knowledge and control by the court of the conditions attending formulation of reorganization plans , the inadequate protection of widely scattered security holders , the frequent adoption of plans which favored management at the expense of other interests , and which afforded the corporation only temporary respite from financial collapse , so often characteristic of reorganizations in equity receiverships , led to the enactment of 77B. 5	@@empty@@	unmatched
The creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission , specially charged by various statutes with the protection of the interests of the investing public , 6 and observed inadequacies of § 77B , 7 led to its revision and enactment in changed form as Chapter X , so as to provide for a larger measure of control by the court over security holders ' committees and the formulation of reorganization plans and to secure impartial and expert administrative assistance in corporate reorganizations through participation of the Commission . Except where the liabilities are less than $ 250,000 , Chapter X requires the appointment of a disinterested trustee , § § 156158 , and a thorough examination and study by the trustee of the debtor 's financial problems and management , § 167(3)(5 ) . The trustee is required to report the result of his study , to send the report to all security holders with notice to submit to him proposals for a plan of reorganization , § 167(5)(6 ) . He then formulates a plan or reports the reasons why a plan can not be formulated , § 169 . By § 176 consent to a plan in advance of its initial approval by the judge is void unless procured with his consent . A large measure of control is given to the court over the reorganization and of committees of security holders and their compensation , § § 163 , 165 , 209 , 212 , 241243 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
If the judge finds the plan presented worthy of consideration he may refer it to the Commission for report and must do so where the liabilities of the debtor , as in the present case , exceed $ 3,000,000 . § 172 . When the plan is submitted to creditors after approval by the judge it is accompanied by the report of the Commission and the opinion of the judge approving the plan , § 175 . The Commission with the approval of the court is authorized to participate generally in the proceedings as a party , and it is its duty to do so upon request of the court , § 208 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
No comparable safeguards are found in Chapter XI . 8 Every phase of the procedure bearing on the administration of the estate and the development of the arrangement is under the control of the debtor . The process of formulating an arrangement and thesolicitation of consent of creditors , sacrifices to speed and economy every safeguard , in the interest of thoroughness and disinterestedness , provided in Chapter X. The debtor is generally permitted to stay in possession and operate the business under the supervision of the Court , § 342 , and a trustee is provided for only in the case where a trustee in bankruptcy has previously been appointed and is in possession , or if ' necessary ' a receiver may be appointed . § 332 . The debtor proposes the arrangement , § § 306(1 ) , 323 , 357 , and the only opportunity afforded the creditors in respect to the proposed plan is to accept or reject it as submitted by the debtor . Acceptances may be solicited either before or after filing the petition and always before approval of the plan by the Court , § 336(4 ) . Section 361 authorizes confirmation of an arrangement when accepted by all the creditors affected by it , ' if the court is satisfied that the arrangement and its acceptance are in good faith , ' and Section 362 permits confirmation if only a majority of the creditors affected accept . The arrangement is to be confirmed if the Court is satisfied that ' ( 1 ) the provisions of this Chapter have been complied with ; ( 2 ) it is for the best interests of the creditors ; ( 3 ) it is fair and equitable and feasible * * * ; and ( 5 ) the proposal and its acceptance are in good faith * * * ' . § 366 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
There are no provisions for an independent study of the debtor 's affairs by court or trustee , or for advice by them to creditors with respect to their rights or interests in advance of their consent to the arrangement . Committees of the creditors are permitted , § § 334 , 338 , but there is no restriction on or supervision over their selection and conduct as in Chapter X. The arrangement may be consummated at the conclusion of a single creditors ' meeting . The Court in passing upon the arrangement , is without the benefit of investigation and study by the trustee or Commission , which Congress has required in reorganization proceedings under Chapter X , and is then faced with the fact that a majority of the creditors have already accepted the plan .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Still more important are the differences in the remedies obtainable under the two chapters which result from differences in the nature of the two proceedings and in the securities which may be affected by them . A plan under Chapter X may affect one or more classes of debts or securities of the corporation to be reorganized , and a subsidiary of the debtor may be brought into such a proceeding and reorganized with the debtor . § 129 . Under Chapter XI only the rights of unsecured creditors of the debtor may be arranged and this without alteration of the status of any other classes of security holders or of subsidiaries . Both chapters provide for confirmation of the plan or arrangement by the judge ' if satisfied that ' it ' is fair and equitable and feasible ' and if ' the proposal ' of the plan or arrangement ' and its acceptance are in good faith ' , § § 221 , 366 . ' Fair and equitable ' , taken from § 77B and made the condition of confirmation under both Chapter X or Chapter XI are ' words of art ' having a well understood meaning in reorganizations in equitable receiverships and under § 77B which is incorporated in the structure of both Chapters X and XI . See Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co. , 308 U.S. 106 , 115 et seq . , 60 S.Ct . 1 , 7 , 84 L.Ed . 110 . The phrase signifies that the plan or arrangement must conform to the rule of Northern Pacific Ry . Co. v. Boyd , 228 U.S. 482 , 33 S.Ct . 554 , 57 L.Ed . 931 , which established the principal which we recently applied in the Los Angeles case , that in any plan of corporate reorganization unsecured creditors are entitled to priority over stockholders to the full extent of their debts and that any scaling down of the claims of creditors without some fair compensating advantage to them which is prior to the rights of stockholders is inadmissible .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Since the sections under Chapter XI already considered admit of an ' arrangement ' only with respect to unsecured creditors without alteration of the relations of any other class of security holders , and since it contemplates , as required by § 366 , that the arrangement shall be fair and equitable within the meaning of the Boyd case , it is evident that Chapter XI gives no appropriate scope for an arrangement of an unsecured indebtedness held by some nine hundred individual creditors of a corporation having seven thousand stockholders . The hope of securing an arrangement which is fair and equitable and in the best interests of unsecured creditors , without some readjustment of the rights of stockholders such as may be had under Chapter X , but is precluded by Chapter XI , is at best but negligible and , if accomplished at all , must be without the aids to the protection of creditors and the public interest which are provided by Chapter X , and which would seem to be indispensable to a just determination whether the plan is fair and equitable .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Respondent suggests that the proposed arrangement may be taken to satisfy the test of the Boyd case since under it the certificate holders would receive a new guarantee , enforcible as to principal notwithstanding the New York moratorium law , in place of the old guarantee to which that law applies . See Honeyman v. Hanen , 275 N.Y. 382 , 9 N.E.2d 970 , appeal dismissed 302 U.S. 375 , 58 S.Ct . 273 , 82 L.Ed . 312 . It also insists that it is not impossible that an arrangement of its unsecured indebtedness under Chapter XI may be proposed which would meet the test . It states that , availing itself of the privilege afforded by § 363 , it has proposed an amended arrangement which is not in the record and the terms of which are not disclosed . But it suggests that the arrangement could be amended so as to provide for a ratable distribution to certificate holders of preferred stock of Trinity , respondent 's subsidiary , held by respondent or for a similar distribution of cash . But such suggestions raise the question whether the supposed advantage to the creditors is a fair and adequate substitute for the elimination of stockholders within the requirements of the Boyd casea question which obviously can not be answered with any assurance in the present case without resort to the facilities for investigation of the financial condition and structure of the debtor and its subsidiary , and to the expert aid and advice of the Commission available under Chapter X.	@@empty@@	unmatched
Confirmation of an arrangement follows a finding of the court that it is for the best interests of the creditors , § 366(2 ) . Here determination of what is in the ' best interest of the creditors ' depends on the answer to the question whether the stockholders should be eliminated or , the creditors should receive some substitute compensation , and whether that compensation is fair and euqitable . In a situation like the present it is in the best interests of the creditors that these questions should be answered in a Chapter X proceeding .	@@empty@@	unmatched
While this means that arrangements of unsecured debts of corporations , like respondent , may not be ' in the best interests of creditors ' and ' feasible ' under Chapter XI , it does not mean that there is no scope for application of that chapter in many cases where the debtor 's financial business and corporate structure differ from respondent 's . This is especially the case with small individual or corporate business where there are no public or private interests involved requiring protection by the procedure and remedies afforded by Chapter X. In cases where subordinate creditors or the stockholders are the managers of its business , the preservation of going - concern value through their continued management of the business may compensate for reduction of the claims of the prior creditors without alteration of the management 's interests , which would otherwise be required by the Boyd case . See Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co. , supra , 308 U.S. at pages 121 , 122 , 60 S.Ct . at page 10 , 84 L.Ed . 110 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Under § 146(2 ) a petition may not be filed under Chapter X unless the judge is satisfied that ' adequate relief ' would not be obtainable under Chapter XI . Obviously the adequacy of the relief under Chapter XI must be appraised in comparison with that to be had under Chapter X , and in the light of its effect on all the public and private interests concerned including those of the debtor . Applying this test , if respondent had proceeded under Chapter X the judge would have been compelled upon inquiry to approve its petition on the ground that it complied with the requirements of Chapter X , and that adequate relief could not be obtained under Chapter XI . That being the case the question here is whether , in the absence of any provision of Chapter XI specifically authorizing the dismissal of the petition , the district court should on that ground have dismissed the proceeding under Chapter XI , leaving respondent free to proceed under Chapter X which affords every remedy which could be obtained under Chapter XI and more .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A bankruptcy court is a court of equity , § 2 , 11 U.S.C. 11 , 11 U.S.C.A. § 11 , and is guided by equitable doctrines and principles except in so far as they are inconsistent with the Act . Bardes v. Hawarden Bank , 178 U.S. 524 , 534 , 535 , 20 S.Ct . 1000 , 1004 , 44 L.Ed . 1175 ; Continental Illinois Nat . Bank & T. Co. v. Chicago R.I. & Pacific Ry . , 294 U.S. 648 , 675 , 55 S.Ct . 595 , 605 , 79 L.Ed . 1110 ; Wayne United Gas Co. v. Owens - Illinois Glass Co. , 300 U.S. 131 , 57 S.Ct . 382 , 81 L.Ed . 557 ; Pepper v. Litton , 308 U.S. 295 , 60 S.Ct . 238 , 84 L.Ed . 281 . A court of equity may in its discretion in the exercise of the jurisdiction committed to it grant or deny relief upon performance of a condition which will safeguard the public interest . It may in the public interest , even withhold relief altogether , and it would seem that it is bound to stay its hand in the public interest when it reasonably appears that private right will not suffer . Pennsylvania v. Williams , supra , 294 U.S. at page 185 , 55 S.Ct . at page 385 , 79 L.Ed . 841 , 96 A.L.R. 1166 , and cases cited ; Virginian Railway v. Federation , 300 U.S. 515 , 549 et seq . , 57 S.Ct . 592 , 600 , 81 L.Ed . 789 . Before the provisions for alternative remedies were brought into the Bankruptcy Act by Chapters X and XI the occasion was rare when a court could have felt free to deny a petition in order to serve some public or collateral interest at the expense of the petitioner 's right to an adjudication . But here respondent , if dismissed , need not go without remedy . All that it can secure rightly or equitably in a Chapter XI proceeding is to be had in a Chapter X proceeding . The case stated most favorably to respondent is that it has proposed an arrangement which appears on its face not to be ' fair and equitable ' and hence not to be entitled to confirmation under Chapter XI . Respondent 's circumstances , as disclosed by its petition and proposed arrangement , are such as to raise a serious question whether any fair and equitable arrangement in the best interest of creditors can be effected without some re - arrangement of its capital structure . In any case that and subsidiary questions can not be answered in the best interest of creditors without recourse to the procedure of a Chapter X proceedings . Pending the litigation respondent seeks to stay the hand of its creditors and in the meantime to avoid that inquiry into its financial condition and practices and its business prospects , provided for by Chapter X without which there is at least danger that any adjustment of its indebtedness will not be just and equitable , and that its revived financial life will be too short to serve any public or private interest other than that of respondent .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In this situation , we think the court was as free to determine whether the relief afforded by Chapter XI was adequate as it would have been if respondent had filed its petition under Chapter X. What the court can decide under § 146 of Chapter X as to the adequacy of the relief afforded by Chapter XI , it can decide in the exercise of its equity powers under Chapter XI for the purpose of safeguarding the public and private interests involved and protecting its own jurisdiction from misuse . Here , we think it was plainly the duty of the district court in the exercise of a sound discretion to have dismissed the petition remitting respondent if it was so advised to the initiation of a proceeding under Chapter X , in which it may secure a reorganization which , after study and investigation appropriate to its corporate business structure and ownership , is found to be fair , equitable and feasible , and in the best interest of creditors . While a bankruptcy court can not , because of its own notions of equitable principles , refuse to award the relief which Congress has accorded the bankrupt , the real question is , what is the relief which Congress has accorded the bankrupt and is it more likely to be secured in a Chapter X or Chapter XI proceeding ? In answering it we can not assume that Congress has disregarded well settled principles of equity , the more so when Congress itself has provided that the relief to be given shall be ' fair and equitable and feasible ' . Good sense and legal tradition alike enjoin that an enactment of Congress dealing with bankruptcy should be read in harmony with the existing system of equity jurisprudence of which it is a part .	@@empty@@	unmatched
If respondent had sought relief by way of an equity receivership such would have been the duty of the Court . Pennsylvania v. Williams , supra . We think it is no less so here . Before the enactment of Chapters X and XI , the district court in a 77B proceeding was ' not bound to clog its docket with visionary or impracticable schemes for resuscitation ' , however honest the efforts of the debtor and however sincere its motives , and it was its duty to dismiss the proceeding whenever it appeared that a fair and equitable plan was not feasible , leaving the debtor to the alternative remedy of bankruptcy liquidation , see Tennessee Publishing Co. v. American National Bank , 299 U.S. 18 , 22 , 57 S.Ct . 85 , 87 , 81 L.Ed . 13 . And it has long been the practice of bankruptcy courts to permit creditors or others not entitled to file pleadings or otherwise contest the allegations of a petition to move for the vacation of an adjudication or the dismissal of a petition on grounds , whether strictly jurisdictional or not , 9 that the proceeding ought not to be allowed to proceed .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court of Appeals thought that the Commission had no such special interest as to entitle it to intervene as of right in the Chapter XI proceeding and concluded that the district court erred in permitting the intervention and that from this it followed that the Commission had no right to appeal . Its decision is in effect that a governmental agency not asserting the right to possession or control of specific property involved in a litigation may not be permitted to intervene without statutory authority . Neither Chapter X nor Chapter XI , in terms , gives a right of ' intervention ' , but the Commission is authorized , with the permission of the court , to appear in any Chapter X proceedings , § 208 . Such right as the Commission may have to intervene in a Chapter XI proceeding is , therefore , governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure , 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c , and the general principles governing intervention . We are not here concerned with the refinements of the distinction between intervention , as a matter of right , which the Court of Appeals thought was restricted to cases where the intervenor has a direct pecuniary interest in the litigation , and permissive intervention , a distinction which has been preserved by Rule 24 of the Rules of Civil Procedure . For here the question is not of the Commission 's intervention ' as of right ' , but whether the district court abused its discretion in permitting it to intervene .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Commission is , as we have seen , charged with the performance of important public duties in every case brought under Chapter X , which will be thwarted , to the public injury , if a debtor may secure adjustment of his debts in a Chapter XI proceeding when , upon the applicable principles which we have discussed , he should be required to proceed , if at all , under Chapter X. The Commission 's duty and its interest extends not only to the performance of its prescribed functions where a petition is filed under Chapter X , but to the prevention , so far as the rules of procedure permit , of interferences with their performance through improper resort to a Chapter XI proceeding in violation of the public policy of the Act which it is the duty of the court to safeguard by relegating respondent to a Chapter X proceeding . The Commission did not here intervene to perform the advisory functions required of it by Chapter X , but to object to an improper exercise of the court 's jurisdiction which , if permitted to continue , contrary to the court 's own equitable duty in the premises , would defeat the public interests which the Commission was designated to represent .

Rule 24 of the Rules of Civil Procedure , made applicable to bankruptcy proceedings by paragraph 37 of the General Orders for Bankruptcy , 11 U.S.C.A. following section 53 , authorizes ' permissive intervention ' . It directs that ' upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action * * * ( 2 ) when an applicant 's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common . In exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties . ' This provision plainly dispenses with any requirement that the intervenor shall have a direct personal or pecuniary interest in the subject of the litigation . Cf . Pennsylvania v. Williams , supra . If , as we have said , it was the duty of the court to dismiss the Chapter XI proceeding because its maintenance there would defeat the public interest in having any scheme of reorganization of respondent subjected to the scrutiny of the Commission , we think it plain that the Commission has a sufficient interest in the maintenance of its statutory authority and the performance of its public duties to entitle it through intervention to prevent reorganizations , which should rightly be subjected to its scrutiny from proceeding without it .

This interest of the Commission does not differ from that of a liquidator under a state statutory proceeding who may , in a proper case , intervene in an equity receivership in a federal court to ask the court to relinquish its jurisdiction in favor of the state proceeding . Pennsylvania v. Williams , supra . Neither the liquidator nor the state has any personal , financial or pecuniary interest in the property in the custody of the federal court . Their only interest , like that of the Commission , is a public one , to maintain the state authority and to secure a liquidation in conformity to state policy . The ' claim or defense ' of the Commission founded upon this interest has a question of law in common with the main proceeding in the course of which any party or a creditor could challenge the propriety of the court 's proceeding under Chapter XI . 10 The claim or defense is thus within the requirement of Rule 24 and intervention was properly allowed . The Commission was , therefore , a party aggrieved by the court 's order refusing to dismiss and was entitled to appeal under § § 24 and 25 of the Bankruptcy Act , 11 U.S.C.A. § § 47 , 48 .

The Chandler Act 1 revised the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 , as amended , and , in chapters X , XI , XII , XIII , and XIV , provided for corporate reorganizations , arrangements , real property arrangements , wage earners ' plans , and Maritime Commission liens .

The proceeding instituted by the respondent , as is conceded , falls precisely within the terms of chapter XI , which deals with arrangements , and confers jurisdiction on the District Court to entertain the cause . But it is said that for the court to exercise that jurisdiction would be so contrary to the unexpressed purpose of Congress that the court should have refused to act . The decision assumes that if Congress had been interrogated as to its intent it would have expressed its will that an arrangement by one having such a financial structure as the respondent should not be permitted , and that , in order to prevent such a result , Congress , if it had been prescient , would have so stated . This seems to me to go beyond the construction of the Act as it is written and to amount to an amendment of it . I think that this is not admissible on the ground advanced that to hold otherwise would be to nullify rather than to effectuate the intent of Congress which is thought to pervade the statutory scheme .	@@empty@@	unmatched

In 1932 the Solicitor General , in a report to the President on the Bankruptcy Act and its administration , 3 pointed out the difficulties of proposing a composition in bankruptcy and suggested relief of the sort which was ultimately accorded by the adoption of § 77B.	@@empty@@	unmatched
By an Act of March 3 , 1933 , 4 there was added to the Act a provision which permitted ' any person excepting a corporation , ' by petition , or by answer in an involuntary proceeding , to assert his insolvency or his inability to meet his debts as they accrued and his desire to effect a composition or an extension of time to pay his debts , and to adjust his indebtedness in that way . Thus an arrangement procedure was provided for individuals who were not insolvent in the bankruptcy sense . The same legislation also provided for agricultural compositions and extensions and for reorganizations of interstate railroads , but Congress did not , at that time , afford any further relief to corporations generally .	@@empty@@	unmatched
By the Act of June 7 , 1934 , 5 § 77B was added , permitting the reorganization of a corporation unable to meet its debts as they mature .	@@empty@@	unmatched
When , by the Chandler Act , Congress determined to revise and codify the entire bankruptcy system , it repealed § 12 and § 74 , and , in liew of them , adopted chapter XI , permitting arrangements of unsecured debts by individuals , partnerships , and corporations . 6 It thus clearly drew a distinction between a reorganization which affects various classes of creditors and stockholders and an arrangement which is merely an extension , adjustment , or accommodation of unsecured claims without disturbing either secured claims or stock interests . Where this simple form of accommodation would suffice , it was not intended that the corporation should have the privilege of a reorganization under chapter X , the successor of § 77B , for it is provided in chapter X ( § 146 ) that a petition shall not be deemed to be filed in good faith if adequate relief would be obtainable by a debtor 's petition under the provisions of chapter XI and further ( § 147 ) that a petition filed under chapter X improperly , because adequate relief can be obtained under chapter XI , may be amended to comply with chapter XI and may be proceeded with as if originally filed under the latter . No such provision is found in chapter XI with respect to a case properly falling under chapter X. Obviously the right to proceed under chapter X was deemed a privilege of which a corporation could not avail itself if it could proceed under chapter XI .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The gravamen of petitioner 's argument is that Congress intended the more detailed and cumbersome procedure of chapter X to apply wherever securities of the corporation were held by the public whereas chapter XI was intended to apply only in the case of individuals or corporations not having such securities outstanding .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Act will be searched in vain for any hint of such a distinction . Small corporations are permitted to avail themselves of chapter X if stockholders ' or secured creditors ' rights are to be affected ; large corporations , under the very letter of chapter XI , may avail themselves of its provisions if all they desire to do is to extend or accommodate their unsecured indebtedness . The smallest corporation can not come in under chapter XI if it desires what has been traditionally known as a reorganization . The largest corporation may proceed under chapter XI if it does not desire a reorganization .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The argument of the Commission comes merely to this : That foresight and providence on the part of Congress would have dictated a different line of demarcation between the two chapters and that what Congress should have said in chapter XI was that any debtor which did not have securities outstanding in the hands of the public might file a petition under chapter XI but that all others must file under chapter X.	@@empty@@	unmatched
The legislative history furnishes but the scantiest support for the argument . Indeed it bears quite as strongly against the Commission 's contention as in its favor . The only item to which counsel is able to point is a committee report to the House 7 wherein it is said :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' Section 12 has been recast ; such features of section 74 are incorporated as are deemed of value and the combined sections are made Chapter XI of the Act under the title ' Arrangement ' * * * The inclusion of corporations will permit a large number of the smaller companies such as are now seeking relief under Section 77B but do not require the complex machinery of that section , to resort to the simpler and less expensive though fully adequate relief afforded by Section 12 . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is undoubtedly true that many more small corporations will find chapter XI available than large ones but this does not at all support the Commission 's claim that the chapter was not intended to be available to companies having securities in the hands of the public .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On the other hand , testimony before the Congressional Committee was to the effect that large corporations would not come under chapter X if they were seeking merely to adjust their unsecured debts and should go , therefore , under chapter XI . 8	@@empty@@	unmatched
One of the draftsmen of the Chandler Act , in a public exposition , 9 has said :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' What is the line of demarcation between proceedings under Chapter X and Chapter XI ? Without attempting to go into detail , Chapter XI proceedings are intended for the reorganization of corporations with simple debt structuresreorganizations under which the interests of stockholders and secured creditors are not to be modified or readjusted . If secured claims or stock interests are to be changed without the consent of all of the stockholders and secured creditors , proceedings must be instituted under Chapter X. '	@@empty@@	unmatched
That chapters X and XI were not written in ignorance of the distinction between corporations having publicly owned securities and those which have not , is shown by the fact that a special committee 's report called attention to this difference and suggested that corporations not having such securities outstanding be permitted to go under the arrangements chapter whereas the first named should be required to file under what is now chapter X. 10 With this suggestion before it Congress adopted a different criterion .	@@empty@@	unmatched
When all is considered it is evident that little support for the Commission 's argument can be gained from the legislative history . It is of no avail to urge that it would have been far better for Congress to adopt a different scheme and that the public interest which Congress had in mind in writing chapter X extends quite as much to a composition such as that proposed in the instant case as to the reorganizations envisaged in chapter X. These considerations may well be urged upon Congress in support of an amendment of the statute but they can have no weight with a court called upon to apply its plain language .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Equally unavailing is the argument that the present case must belong under chapter X since secured creditors and stockholders must be brought into the reckoning and because one of the requirements of § 366 is that the court must find the arrangement is ' fair and equitable and feasible ' . It is said that this phrase is a term of art , given meaning by our decision in Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Boyd , 228 U.S. 482 , 33 S.Ct . 554 , 57 L.Ed . 931 , and that , within that meaning , no fair , equitable , and feasible plan can here be accomplished under chapter XI although it could be under chapter X.	@@empty@@	unmatched
The short answer is that the phrase is used not only in chapter XI and chapter X but also in chapter XII respecting real property arrangements , and in chapter XIII respecting wage earners ' plans . 11 Obviously the phrase as used in the Chandler Act must be given the connotation appropriate to the section in which it is used .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Another argument put forward is that , as courts of bankruptcy are courts of equity , they may , as a chancellor might in the case of a bill for receivership , find that the balance of convenience requires a refusal to exercise a jurisdiction possessed . I think this is a complete misapplication of the principle that a court of bankruptcy is a court of equity . That has been many times stated but never in connection with the right of a debtor to invoke the remedy provided by Congress in the bankruptcy laws . The legislature has specified who is entitled to the relief provided by the statute and in what circumstances . The court has no power to refuse that relief on the ground that some other relief would better serve the purpose . What is meant by the statement that a court of bankruptcy is a court of equity is that its function is to make an equitable distribution of the estate among the creditors , but the principle has not been applied in the sense that the court may , in its better judgment , refuse to award the relief which Congress has accorded the bankrupt .	@@empty@@	unmatched
No stockholder or creditor , secured or unsecured , has attempted to raise the question of the District Court 's jurisdiction under chapter XI . The Securities and Exchange Commission , although charged with no duty by the Act in connection with proceedings under chapter XI , has sought to intervene and to appeal from a decision by the District Court adverse to the Commission 's views . Although the Commission may be permitted to appear in chapter X proceedings , it is expressly provided that it may not appeal from any decision . 12 No analogous provision is found in chapter XI although that chapter does , in certain instances , grant interested parties the right to be heard . 13	@@empty@@	unmatched
By general order the Rules of Civil Procedure are made applicable in bankruptcy so far as practicable . It is suggested that Rule 24 authorizes the Commission 's intervention but a mere reading of the rule shows that neither intervention of right , nor permissive intervention , is available to the Commission in this case . The Commission may not intervene as of right under the rule because no statute confers on it an unconditional right to intervene ; the Commission has no interest which may be bound by a judgment in the action ; and it can not be adversely affected by the court 's decision . It is not entitled to permissive intervention because no statute confers a conditional right to intervene and because it has no claim or defense which will be affected by any decision of law or fact by the court . The cases in which bankruptcy courts have allowed creditors to raise questions of venue or of jurisdiction to adjudicate under the terms of the statute , where the proceeding would affect the creditors ' financial interest , are inapposite , as are also equity receivership cases where an official intervenes in order to claim the right , as such official , to take over and administer the property in the possession of the court .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Texas v. New Mexico et al .	@@empty@@	unmatched
To resolve their disputes over water rights in the Rio Grande , Colorado , New Mexico , and Texas , with Congress ’s approval , signed the Rio Grande Compact . The Compact requires Colorado to deliver a specified amount of water annually to New Mexico at the state line and directs New Mexico to deliver a specified amount of water to the Elephant Butte Reservoir . The Reservoir was completed in 1916 as part of the Federal Government ’s Rio Grande Project and plays a central role in fulfilling the United States ’s obligations to supply water under a 1906 treaty with Mexico as well as under several agreements with downstream water districts in New Mexico and Texas ( Downstream Contracts ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Texas brought this original action complaining that New Mexico has violated the Compact by allowing downstream New Mexico users to siphon off water below the Reservoir in ways not anticipated in the Downstream Contracts . The United States intervened and filed a complaint with parallel allegations .

This Court agreed to hear two exceptions to the report concerning the scope of the claims the United States can assert here : The United States says it may pursue claims for Compact violations ; Colorado says the United States should be permitted to pursue claims only to the extent they arise under the 1906 treaty with Mexico .	@@empty@@	unmatched

STATE OF TEXAS , PLAINTIFF v. STATE OFNEW MEXICO and STATE OF COLORADO	@@empty@@	unmatched
Will Rogers reportedly called the Rio Grande “ the only river I ever saw that needed irrigation . ” In its long journey from the Colorado Rockies to the Gulf of Mexico , many and sometimes competing demands are made on the river ’s resources . In an effort to reconcile some of those demands , Colorado , New Mexico , and Texas , acting with the federal government ’s assent , signed the Rio Grande Compact in the 1930s . In today ’s lawsuit , Texas claims that New Mexico has defied the Compact . But at this stage in the proceedings we face only a preliminary and narrow question : May the United States , as an intervenor , assert essentially the same claims Texas already has ? We believe it may .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Like its namesake , the Rio Grande Compact took a long and circuitous route to ratification . Its roots trace perhaps to the 1890s , when Mexico complained to the United States that increasing demands on the river upstream left little for those below the border . The federal government responded by proposing , among other things , to build a reservoir and guarantee Mexico a regular and regulated release of water . Eventually , the government identified a potential dam site near Elephant Butte , New Mexico , about 105 miles north of the Texas state line . The government presented this suggestion to representatives of Mexico and the affected States in a 1904 “ ‘ Irrigation Congress,’ ” where it was “ ‘ heartily endorse[d ] and approve[d].’ ” Official Proceedings of the Twelfth National Irrigation Congress 107 ( G. Mitchell ed . 1905 ) . So , in 1906 , the United States agreed by treaty to deliver 60,000 acre - feet of water annually to Mexico upon completion of the new reservoir . Convention Between the United States and Mexico Providing for the Equitable Distribution of the Waters of the Rio Grande for Irrigation Purposes , 34Stat . 2953 . After obtaining the necessary water rights , the United States began construction of the dam in 1910 and completed it in 1916 as part of a broader infrastructure development known as the Rio Grande Project .	@@empty@@	unmatched
But that still left the problem of resolving similar disputes among the various States . After a number of interim agreements and impasses , the affected parties eventu - ally ( and nearly simultaneously ) negotiated several agreements . And here again the Rio Grande Project and its Elephant Butte Reservoir played a central role . In the first set of agreements , the federal government promised to supply water from the Reservoir to downstream water districts with 155,000 irrigable acres in New Mexico and Texas . In turn , the water districts agreed to pay charges in proportion to the percentage of the total acres lying in each State — roughly 57 % for New Mexico and 43 % for Texas . We will call those agreements the “ Downstream Contracts . ” Additionally , Colorado , New Mexico , and Texas concluded the Rio Grande Compact , which Congress approved in 1939 . Act of May 31 , 1939 , 53Stat . 785 . In the Compact , the parties indicated that nothing in their agreement should be “ construed as affecting ” the federal government ’s treaty duties to deliver promised water to Mexico , but only as resolving disputes among themselves . Id. , at 792 . Toward that end , the Compact required Colorado to deliver a specified amount of water annually to New Mexico at the state line . Id. , at 787–788 . But then , instead of similarly requiring New Mexico to deliver a specified amount of water annually to the Texas state line , the Compact directed New Mexico to deliver water to the Reservoir . Id. , at 788 . 1 * In isolation , this might have seemed a curious choice , for a promise to deliver water to a reservoir more than 100 miles inside New Mexico would seemingly secure nothing for Texas . But the choice made all the sense in the world in light of the simultaneously negotiated Downstream Contracts that promised Texas water districts a certain amount of water every year from the Reservoir ’s resources .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Fast forward to this dispute . Texas filed an original action before this Court complaining that New Mexico has violated the Compact . According to Texas , New Mexico is effectively breaching its Compact duty to deliver water to the Reservoir by allowing downstream New Mexico users to siphon off water below the Reservoir in ways the Downstream Contracts do not anticipate . After we permitted the United States to intervene , it also filed a complaint with allegations that parallel Texas ’s . In response to these complaints , New Mexico filed a motion to dismiss . A Special Master we appointed to consider the case received briefing , heard argument , and eventually issued an in - terim report recommending that we deny New Mexico ’s motion to dismiss Texas ’s complaint . We accepted that recommendation . At the same time , the Master recommended that we dismiss in part the complaint filed by the United States . The Master reasoned , in pertinent part , that the Compact does not confer on the United States the power to enforce its terms . In response to the Master ’s report , the parties filed a number of exceptions . We agreed to hear two of these exceptions — one by the United States and one by Colorado — concerning the scope of the claims the United States can assert in this original action . The United States says it may pursue claims for violations of the Compact itself ; Colorado says the United States should be permitted to pursue claims only to the extent they arise under the 1906 treaty with Mexico .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Our analysis begins with the Constitution . Its Compact Clause provides that “ [ n]o State shall , without the Consent of Congress , . . . enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State . ” Art . I , § 10 , cl . 3 . Congress ’s approval serves to “ prevent any compact or agreement between any two States , which might affect injuriously the interests of the others . ” Florida v. Georgia , 17 How . 478 , 494 ( 1855 ) . It also ensures that the Legislature can “ check any infringement of the rights of the national government . ” 3 J. Story , Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States § 1397 , p. 272 ( 1833 ) ( in subsequent editions , § 1403 ) . So , for example , if a proposed interstate agreement might lead to friction with a foreign country or injure the interests of another region of our own , Congress may withhold its approval . But once Congress gives its consent , a compact between States — like any other federal statute — becomes the law of the land . Texas v. New Mexico , 462 U. S. 554 , 564 ( 1983 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Our role in compact cases differs from our role in ordinary litigation . The Constitution endows this Court with original jurisdiction over disputes between the States . See Art . III , § 2 . And this Court ’s role in these cases is to serve “ ‘ as a substitute for the diplomatic settlement of controversies between sovereigns and a possible resort to force.’ ” Kansas v. Nebraska , 574 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2015 ) ( slip op . , at 6 ) ( quoting North Dakota v. Minnesota , 263 U. S. 365 , 372–373 ( 1923 ) ) . As a result , the Court may , “ [ i]n this singular sphere , . . . ‘ regulate and mould the process it uses in such a manner as in its judgment will best promote the purposes of justice.’ ” 574 U. S. , at _ _ _ – _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 6–7 ) ( quoting Kentucky v. Dennison , 24 How . 66 , 98 ( 1861 ) ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Using that special authority , we have sometimes permitted the federal government to participate in compact suits to defend “ distinctively federal interests ” that a normal litigant might not be permitted to pursue in traditional litigation . Maryland v. Louisiana , 451 U. S. 725 , 745 , n. 21 ( 1981 ) . At the same time , our permission should not be confused for license . Viewed from some sufficiently abstract level of generality , almost any compact between the States will touch on some concern of the national government — foreign affairs , interstate commerce , taxing and spending . No doubt that is the very reason why the Constitution requires congressional ratification of state compacts . But just because Congress enjoys a special role in approving interstate agreements , it does not necessarily follow that the United States has blanket authority to intervene in cases concerning the construction of those agreements .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Still , bearing in mind our unique authority to mold original actions , several considerations taken collectively persuade us that the United States may pursue the particular claims it has pleaded in this case :	@@empty@@	unmatched
First , the Compact is inextricably intertwined with the Rio Grande Project and the Downstream Contracts . The Compact indicates that its purpose is to “ effec[t ] an equitable apportionment ” of “ the waters of the Rio Grande ” between the affected States . 53Stat . 785 . Yet it can achieve that purpose only because , by the time the Compact was executed and enacted , the United States had negotiated and approved the Downstream Contracts , in which it assumed a legal responsibility to deliver a certain amount of water to Texas . In this way , the United States might be said to serve , through the Downstream Contracts , as a sort of “ ‘ agent’ of the Compact , charged with assuring that the Compact ’s equitable apportionment ” to Texas and part of New Mexico “ is , in fact , made . ” Texas ’s Reply to Exceptions to the First Interim Report of the Special Master 40 . Or by way of another rough analogy , the Compact could be thought implicitly to incorporate the Downstream Contracts by reference . Cf . 11 R. Lord , Williston on Contracts § 30:26 ( 4th ed . 2017 ) . However described , it is clear enough that the federal government has an interest in seeing that water is deposited in the Reservoir consistent with the Compact ’s terms . That is what allows the United States to meet its duties under the Downstream Contracts , which are themselves essential to the fulfillment of the Compact ’s expressly stated purpose .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Second , New Mexico has conceded that the United States plays an integral role in the Compact ’s operation . Early in these proceedings , it argued that the federal government was an indispensable party to this lawsuit because it is “ responsible for . . . delivery of . . . water ” as required by the Downstream Contracts and anticipated by the Compact . Brief in Opposition 33 ; ibid . ( “ [ T]he entry of a Decree in accordance with Texas’ Prayer for Relief would necessarily affect the United States’ interests in the [ Rio Grande ] Project ” contract ) . And at oral argument , New Mexico contended that the federal government is so integrally a part of the Compact ’s operation that a State could sue the United States under the Compact for interfering with its operation . Tr . of Oral Arg . 59 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Third , a breach of the Compact could jeopardize the federal government ’s ability to satisfy its treaty obligations . See Sanitary Dist . of Chicago v. United States , 266 U. S. 405 , 423–425 ( 1925 ) ( recognizing the strong interests of the United States in preventing interference with its treaty obligations ) . Our treaty with Mexico requires the federal government to deliver 60,000 acre - feet of water annually from the Elephant Butte Reservoir . And to fill that Reservoir the Compact obliges New Mexico to deliver a specified amount of water to the facility . So a failure by New Mexico to meet its Compact obligations could directly impair the federal government ’s ability to perform its obligations under the treaty . Now the Compact says plainly that it may not be “ construed as affecting the obligations of the United States of America to Mexico ” under existing treaties . 53Stat . 792 . But that means only that the Compact seeks to avoid impairing the federal government ’s treaty obligations . Permitting the United States to proceed here will allow it to ensure that those obligations are , in fact , honored .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Fourth , the United States has asserted its Compact claims in an existing action brought by Texas , seeking substantially the same relief and without that State ’s objection . This case does not present the question whether the United States could initiate litigation to force a State to perform its obligations under the Compact or expand the scope of an existing controversy between States .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Taken together , we are persuaded these factors favor allowing the United States to pursue the Compact claims it has pleaded in this original action . Nothing in our opinion should be taken to suggest whether a different result would obtain in the absence of any of the considerations we have outlined or in the presence of additional , countervailing considerations . The United States ’s exception is sustained , all other exceptions are overruled , and the case is remanded to the Special Master for further proceedings consistent with this opinion .	@@empty@@	unmatched

After stating the facts of this case , the learned judge proceeds ; ' Since I have had the honour to sit in this court I have prescribed to myself certain rules , by the application of which , my judgment , in cases of this nature , has been uniformly governed . 1st . Where the claimants assume the onus probandi ( as they do in this case ) not to acquit the property , unless the defence be proved beyond a reasonable doubt . 2d . If the evidence of the claimants be clear and precisely in point , not to indulge in vague and indeterminate suspicions , but to pronounce an acquittal , unless that evidence be clouded with incredibility , or encountered by strong presumptions of mala fides , from the other circumstances of the case . ' He also alludes to the absence of documentary evidence to support the defence set up by the claimants as affording an example of the application of these rules , as well as of another rule equally important . ' What strikes me as decisive against the defense is the entire absence of all documents respecting the cargo . Bills of lading , letters of advice , or general orders , must have existed . If the cargo had been destined for Boston only , there would not have been so much difficulty . But the defence shows its destination ultimately for Liverpool . Where , then , is the contract of affreightment , the bills of lading , the letters of advice , and the correspondence of the shippers , or of Mr. P. Grant ? Can it be credible that , without any authority , the master , or part owner of the ship should , on their own responsibility , have gone to Liverpool , without orders or consignment ? That from a mere vague knowledge of the wishes of the shippers , they should place at imminent risk the whole property , without written authority to colour their proceedings ? There must have been papers . They are not produced . The affidavits of the shippers , of Mr. Grant , of the consignees in England , are not produced . What must be the conclusion from this general silence ? It must be , that if produced , they would not support the asserted defence .

Applicant , the State of California , asks that I stay pending disposition of its petition for certiorari the enforcement of the judgment of the California Supreme Court , which invalidated the death sentence imposed on respondent Hamilton for the 1979 murder of a woman near San Diego . 41 Cal.3d 408 , 221 Cal .

UNITED STATES v. QUALITY STORES , INC . , et al .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Respondent Quality Stores , Inc. , and its affiliates ( collectively Quality Stores ) made severance payments to employees who were involuntarily terminated as part of Quality Stores’ Chapter 11 bankruptcy . Payments — which were made pursuant to plans that did not tie payments to the receipt of state unemployment insurance — varied based on job seniority and time served . Quality Stores paid and withheld , inter alia , taxes required under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act ( FICA ) , 26 U. S. C. § 3101 et seq . Later believing that the payments should not have been taxed as wages under FICA , Quality Stores sought a refund on behalf of itself and about 1,850 former employees . When the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) did not allow or deny the refund , Quality Stores initiated proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court , which granted summary judgment in its favor . The District Court and Sixth Circuit affirmed , concluding that severance payments are not wages under FICA .	@@empty@@	unmatched

This case presents the question whether severance pay - ments made to employees terminated against their will are taxable wages under the Federal Insurance Contri - butions Act ( FICA ) , 26 U. S. C. § 3101 et seq .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the payments are not wages taxed by FICA . To reach its holding , the Court of Appeals relied not on FICA ’s definition of wages but on § 3402(o ) of the Internal Revenue Code , a provision governing income - tax withholding . That conclusion , for the reasons to be discussed , was incorrect .	@@empty@@	unmatched
FICA ’s broad definition of wages includes the severance payments made here . And § 3402(o ) does not alter that definition . Section 3402(o ) instructs that any severance payment “ shall be treated as if it were a payment of wages . ” According to the Court of Appeals , § 3402(o ) suggeststhat the definition of wages for income - tax withholding does not extend to severance payments ; and so , the argument continues , severance payments also must be beyond the terms of FICA ’s similar definition . But § 3402(o ) is entirely compatible with the proposition that some or all payments do fall within the broad definition of the term wages . Section 3402(o ) was enacted in response to a narrow , specific problem regarding income - tax withholding . In addition , were the Court to rule that the severance payments made here are exempt from FICA taxation but not from withholding under § 3402 for income - tax pur - poses , it would contravene the holding in Rowan Cos . v. United States , 452 U. S. 247 ( 1981 ) , which held there should be congruence in the rules for FICA and income - tax withholding .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Quality Stores , Inc. , an agricultural - specialty retailer , entered bankruptcy proceedings in 2001 . Before and following the filing of an involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition , respondents Quality Stores and affiliated companies , all referred to here as Quality Stores , terminated thousands of employees . The employees received severance payments , which all parties to this case stipulate were the result of a reduction in work force or discontinuance of a plant or operation . The payments were made pursuant to one of two different termination plans . ( For reasons later to be explained , it should be noted that neither termination plan tied severance payments to the receipt of state unemployment compensation . )	@@empty@@	unmatched
Under the first plan , terminated employees received severance pay based on job grade and management level . The president and chief executive officer received 18 months of severance pay , senior managers received 12 months of severance pay , and other employees received one week of severance pay for each year of service .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The second plan was designed to facilitate Quality Stores’ postbankruptcy operations and encourage employees to put off their job searches . To receive severance pay , employees had to complete their last day of service as determined by the employer . Officers received between 6 and 12 months of severance pay , and full - time employees and employees paid by the hour received one week of severance pay for every year of service if the employees had been employed for at least two years , up to a stated maximum of severance pay . Workers who had been employed for less than two years received a week of severance pay .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Quality Stores reported the severance payments as wages on W–2 tax forms , paid the employer ’s required share of FICA taxes , and withheld employees’ share of FICA taxes . Then Quality Stores asked 3,100 former employees to allow it to file FICA tax refund claims for them . About 1,850 former employees agreed to allow Qual - ity Stores to pursue FICA refunds . On its own behalf and on behalf of the former employees , Quality Stores filed for a refund of $ 1,000,125 in FICA taxes . The Internal Revenue Service neither allowed nor denied the claim .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Quality Stores initiated a proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court seeking a refund of the disputed amount . The Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment in its favor . The District Court and Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed , concluding that severance payments are not “ wages ” under FICA . See In re Quality Stores , Inc. , 693 F. 3d 605 ( 2012 ) . Other Courts of Appeals , however , have concluded that at least some severance payments do constitute wages subject to FICA tax . See , e.g. , CSX Corp. v. United States , 518 F. 3d 1328 ( CA Fed . 2008 ) ; University of Pittsburgh v. United States , 507 F. 3d 165 ( CA3 2007 ) ; North Dakota State Univ . v. United States , 255 F. 3d 599 ( CA8 2001 ) .

To fund benefits provided by the Social Security Act and Medicare , FICA taxes “ wages ” paid by an employer or re - ceived by an employee “ with respect to employment . ” 26 U. S. C. § § 3101(a ) , ( b ) , 3111(a ) , ( b ) . Congress chose to define wages under FICA “ broadly . ” Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed . and Research v. United States , 562 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2011 ) ( slip op . , at 2 ) . FICA defines “ wages ” as “ all remuneration for employment , including the cash value of all remuneration ( including benefits ) paid in any medium other than cash . ” § 3121(a ) . The term “ employment ” encompasses “ any service , of whatever nature , performed . . . by an employee for the person employing him . ” § 3121(b ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Under this definition , and as a matter of plain meaning , severance payments made to terminated employees are “ remuneration for employment . ” Severance payments are , of course , “ remuneration , ” and common sense dictates that employees receive the payments “ for employment . ” Severance payments are made to employees only . It wouldbe contrary to common usage to describe as a severance payment remuneration provided to someone who has not worked for the employer . Severance payments are made in consideration for employment — for a “ service . . . performed ” by “ an employee for the person employing him , ” per FICA ’s definition of the term “ employment . ” Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In Social Security Bd . v. Nierotko , 327 U. S. 358 ( 1946 ) , the Court interpreted the term “ wages ” in the Social Security statutory context to have substantial breadth . In that case a worker , who had been wrongfully terminated , sought to have his backpay counted as taxable wages for the purpose of obtaining credits under the Social Security system . The Court stated that the term “ service , ” used with respect to Social Security , “ means not only work actually done but the entire employer - employee relationship for which compensation is paid to the employee by the employer . ” Id. , at 365–366 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
As confirmation of that principle , severance payments often vary , as they did here , according to the function and seniority of the particular employee who is terminated . For example , under both termination plans , Quality Stores employees were given severance payments based on job grade and management level . And under the second termination plan , nonofficer employees who had served at least two years with their company received more in severance pay than nonofficer employees who had not — a standard example of a company policy to reward employees for a greater length of good service and loyalty .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In this respect severance payments are like many other benefits employers offer to employees above and beyond salary payments . Like health and retirement benefits , stock options , or merit - based bonuses , a competitive severance payment package can help attract talented employees . Here , the terminations leading to the severance payments were triggered by the employer ’s involuntary bankruptcy proceeding , a prospect against which employees may wish to protect themselves in an economy that is always subject to changing conditions .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Severance payments , moreover , can be desirable from the perspective of the employer as an alternative or supplemental form of remuneration . In situations in which Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization is necessary , an employer may seek to retain goodwill by paying its terminated employees well , thus reinforcing its reputation as a worthy employer . Employers who downsize in a period of slow business may wish to retain the ability to rehire employees who have been terminated .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A specific exemption under FICA for certain termination - related payments reinforces the conclusion that the payments in question are well within the definition of wages . Section 3121(a)(13)(A ) exempts from taxablewages any severance payments made “ because of . . . retire - ment for disability . ” That exemption would be unnecessary were severance payments in general not within FICA ’s definition of “ wages . ” Cf . American Bank & Trust Co. v. Dallas County , 463 U. S. 855 , 864 ( 1983 ) ( declining to read a statute in a manner that would cause “ spe - cific exemptions ” to be “ superfluous ” ) . FICA ’s definitional section , moreover , provides a lengthy list of specific exemptions from the definition of wages . For example , FICA exempts from wages payments on account of disability caused by sickness or accident , cash payments made for domestic service in a private home under a certain amount , and cash tips less than a certain amount . See § § 3121(a)(2)(A ) , ( 7)(B ) , ( 12)(B ) . The specificity of these exemptions reinforces the broad nature of FICA ’s definition of wages .	@@empty@@	unmatched
FICA ’s statutory history sheds further light on the text of § 3121 , which defines the term “ wages . ” FICA was originally enacted in Title VIII of the Social Security Act , 49Stat . 636 . ( In 1939 , Title VIII was transferred to the Internal Revenue Code and became FICA . 53Stat . 1387 . ) Title VIII contained , in substance , definitions of “ wages ” and “ employment ” identical to those FICA now provides . See § 811(a ) , 49Stat . 639 ; § 811(b ) , ibid . With respect to the Social Security Act , in 1936 the Treasury Department promulgated a regulation stating that the statutory definition of “ wages ” included “ dismissal pay . ” Bureau of Internal Revenue , Employees’ Tax and the Employers’ Tax Under Title VIII of the Social Security Act , 1 Fed . Reg . 1764 , 1769 ( 1936 ) . Congress responded a few years later , in 1939 , by creating an exception from “ wages ” for “ [ d]ismissal payments which the employer is not legally required to make . ” Social Security Act Amendments of 1939 , § 606 , 53Stat . 1384 ( codified at 26 U. S. C. § 1426(a)(4 ) ( 1940 ed . ) ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In 1950 , however , Congress repealed that exception . Social Security Act Amendments , § 203(a ) , 64Stat . 525–527 . “ When Congress acts to amend a statute , we presume it intends its amendment to have real and sub - stantial effect . ” Stone v. INS , 514 U. S. 386 , 397 ( 1995 ) . Congress has not revisited its 1950 amendment ; and since that time , FICA has contained no exception for severance payments .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The next question is whether § 3402(o ) of the Internal Revenue Code relating to income - tax withholding is a limitation on the meaning of “ wages ” for FICA purposes . Section 3402 provides :	@@empty@@	unmatched

( Pursuant to stipulations by the parties , the Court of Appeals determined that the severance payments constitute “ supplemental unemployment compensation benefits , ” or SUBs . See § 3402(o)(2)(A ) . The Court assumes , for purposes of this case , that this premise is correct . )	@@empty@@	unmatched
Quality Stores argues that § 3402(o ) ’s instruction that SUBs be treated “ as if ” they were wages for purposes of income - tax withholding is an indirect means of stating that the definition of wages for income - tax withholding does not cover severance payments . It contends , further , that if the definition of wages for purposes of income - tax withholding does not encompass severance payments , then severance payments are not covered by FICA ’s similar definition of wages .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court disagrees that § 3402(o ) should be read as Quality Stores suggests . The chapter governing income - tax withholding has a broad definition of the term “ wages ” : “ all remuneration . . . for services performed by an employee for his employer , including the cash value of all remuneration ( including benefits ) paid in any medium other than cash . ” § 3401(a ) . The definitional section for income - tax withholding , like the definitional section for FICA , contains a series of specific exemptions that reinforce the broad scope of its definition of wages . The provision exempts from wages , for example , any remuneration paid for domestic service in a private home , for services rendered to a foreign government , and for services performed by a minister of a church in the course of his duties . § § 3401(a)(3 ) , ( 5 ) , ( 9 ) . Severance payments are not exempted , and they squarely fall within the broad textual definition of wages for purposes of income - tax withholding under § 3401(a ) , for the same reasons outlined above with respect to FICA ’s similar definition of wages .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Quality Stores contends that , the broad wording of the definition in § 3401(a ) aside , severance payments must fall outside the definition of wages for income - tax withholding . Otherwise , it argues , § 3402(o ) would be superfluous . But , as the Government points out , § 3402(o ) ’s command that all severance payments be treated “ as if ” they were wages for income - tax withholding is in all respects consistent with the proposition that at least some severance payments are wages . As the Federal Circuit explained when construing § 3402(o ) , the statement that “ all men shall be treated as if they were six feet tall does not imply that no men are six feet tall . ” CSX Corp. , 518 F. 3d , at 1342 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In the last of its textual arguments , Quality Stores draws attention to the boldface heading of § 3402(o ) , which states , “ Extension of withholding to certain payments other than wages . ” It contends the heading declares that the payments enumerated within § 3402(o ) are “ other than wages . ” Captions , of course , can be “ a useful aid in resolving ” a statutory text ’s “ ambiguity . ” FTC v. Mandel Brothers , Inc. , 359 U. S. 385–389 ( 1959 ) . But Quality Stores can not rely on the statutory heading to support its argument that § 3402(o ) , without ambiguity , excludes all severance payments from the definition of wages . The heading states that withholding is extended to “ certain payments . ” This falls short of a declaration that all the payments listed in § 3402(o ) are not wages .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Next , the regulatory background against which § 3402(o ) was enacted illustrates the limited nature of the problem the provision was enacted to address . For this purpose , it is instructive to concentrate on the statutory term “ supplemental unemployment benefits , ” which defines the scope of § 3402(o ) ’s income - tax withholding mandate .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The concept of SUBs originated in labor demands for a guaranteed annual wage . When it became clear this was “ impractical in their industries , unions such as the Steelworkers and the United Auto Workers transformed their guaranteed annual wage demands into proposals to supplement existing unemployment compensation programs . ” Coffy v. Republic Steel Corp. , 447 U. S. 191 , 200 ( 1980 ) . A SUB plan , as originally conceived , offered “ second - level protection against layoff ” by supplementing unemployment benefits offered by the States . Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In the 1950 ’s , major American employers such as Ford Motor Company adopted SUB plans of this type , agreeing to fund trusts that would provide SUBs to terminated employees . For example , Ford ’s contract with employees defined the concept of SUBs as the receipt of “ both a state system unemployment benefit and a Weekly Supplemental Benefit . . . without reduction of the state system unemployment benefit because of the payment of the Weekly Supplemental Benefit . ” Note , Effect of Receiving Supplemental Unemployment Benefits on Eligibility for State Benefits , 69 Harv . L. Rev. 362 , 364 , n. 11 ( 1955 ) ; seeJ. Becker , Guaranteed Income for the Unemployed : The Story of SUB ( 1968 ) . Employer plans that provided SUBs sought “ to provide economic security for regular employees ” and “ to assure a stable work force through periods of short - term layoffs . ” Coffy , supra , at 200 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
But an obstacle arose . For these plans to work , it was necessary to avoid having the SUBs defined under federal law as “ wages . ” That was because some States only provided unemployment benefits if terminated employees were not earning “ wages ” from their employers . See Brief for United States 29 ; CSX Corp. , supra , at 1334–1335 ; Note , 69 Harv . L. Rev. , at 366 ( “ The typical state unemployment compensation statute provides that ‘ an individual shall be deemed unemployed in any week with respect to which no wages are payable to him and during which he performs no services . . .’ ” ( ellipsis and emphasis in original ) ) ; i d . , at 367 ( “ [ S]tates tend to treat as ‘ wages’ those items which the federal government treats as ‘ wages’ ” ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The inability of terminated employees to receive state unemployment benefits , of course , would render SUBs far less useful to them and their employers . Employers , as a consequence , undertook to ensure that the Federal Government did not construe benefits paid out by SUB plans as “ wages . ” CSX Corp. , supra , at 1334–1335 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In at least partial response to the prospect of differential treatment of SUBs based on the vagaries of state law , the IRS promulgated a series of Revenue Rulings in the 1950 ’s and 1960 ’s that took the position that SUB payments were not “ wages ” under FICA as well as for purposes of income - tax withholding . Rev. Rul . 56–249 , 1956–1 Cum . Bull . 488 ; see Rev. Rul . 58–128 , 1958–1 Cum . Bull . 89 ; Rev. Rul . 60–330 , 1960–2 Cum .

Although the IRS exempted SUBs paid to terminated employees from withholding for income - tax purposes , the payments still were considered taxable income . Rev. Rul . 56–249 , 1956–1 Cum . Bull . 488 . As a result , terminated employees faced significant tax liability at the end ofthe year . The Treasury Department suggested Congress authorize the agency to promulgate regulations allowing voluntary withholding .

In 1969 , Congress chose instead to address the withholding problem by enacting § 3402(o ) . It provides that all severance payments — that is , both SUBs as well as severance payments that the IRS considered wages — shall be “ treated as if ” they were wages for purposes of income - tax withholding . It is apparent that the definition Congress adopted in § 3402(o ) is not limited to the SUBs that the IRS had deemed exempt from wages under FICA . See § 3402(o)(2)(A ) . It must be presumed that Congress was aware that § 3402(o ) covered more than the severance payments that were excluded from income - tax withholding . Not all severance payment plans were tied to state unemployment benefits ; and , before § 3402(o ) ’s 1969 enactment , the IRS ruled that severance payments not linked to state unemployment benefits were wages for purposes of income - tax withholding . See Rev. Rul . 65–251 , 1965–2 Cum . Bull . 395 ; see also TAM 9416003 ( the IRS’ original 1956 exception for SUBs provided “ a limited exception from the definition of wages for . . . federal income tax withholding . . . only if the payments are de - signed to supplement the receipt of state unemployment compensation and are actually tied to state unemployment benefits ” ) ; ibid . ( “ SUB - pay plans must be designed to supplement unemployment benefits . . . ” ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Once this background is understood , the Court of Appeals’ interpretation of § 3402(o ) as standing for some broad definitional principle is shown to be incorrect . Although Congress need not have agreed with the Revenue Rulings to enact § 3402(o ) , its purpose to eliminatethe withholding problem caused by the differential treatment of severance payments is the necessary background to understand the meaning and purpose of the provision . The problem Congress sought to resolve was the prospect that terminated employees would owe large payments in taxes at the end of the year as a result of the IRS’ exemption of certain SUBs from withholding . It remained possible that the IRS would determine that other forms of SUB plans , perhaps linked differently to state unemployment benefits , should be exempt from withholding . If Congress had only incorporated the Revenue Rulings already in effect , that response may have risked the withholding problem arising once again . On the other hand , by drawing a withholding requirement that was broader than then - current IRS exemptions , Congress avoided these practical problems . A requirement that a form of remuneration already included as wages be treated “ as if ” it were wages created no administrative difficulties .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court of Appeals understood Congress’ decision to include within § 3402(o ) a larger set of SUBs than was already exempt from withholding under IRS Revenue Rulings to mean that all SUBs were excluded from the definition of wages . But that assumption , although in the abstract not necessarily an illogical inference , is unsustainable , considering the regulatory background against which § 3402(o ) was enacted . Congress interpreted the Revenue Rulings not at all as a definitive gloss on the meaning of the term “ wages ” in § 3401 . The better reading is that Congress determined that , whatever position the IRS took with respect to certain categories of severance payments , the problem with withholding should be solved by treating all severance payments as wages requiring withholding .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The necessary conclusion is that § 3402(o ) does not narrow the term “ wages ” under FICA to exempt all severance payments . This reasoning is consistent with Rowan , a previous decision interpreting FICA . In Rowan , the Court held that Treasury Regulations interpreting “ wages”un - der FICA to include the value of meals and lodging were invalid . The Government conceded , for income - tax purposes , that the taxpayer in Rowan was correct to exempt the value of the meals and lodging in computing the wages properly withheld under § 3402 . 452 U. S. , at 250–251 . But it argued , nevertheless , that the value of the meals and lodging was taxable as wages under FICA , pursuant to Treasury Regulations . The Rowan Court observed that the definition of wages under FICA was in substance the same as for purposes of withholding . Id. , at 255 . The Court read that similarity to be “ strong evidence that Congress intended ‘ wages’ to mean the same thing under FICA . . . and income - tax withholding . ” Ibid . To support that conclusion , the Court noted a “ congressional concern for ‘ the interest of simplicity and ease of administration.’ ” Ibid . ( quoting S. Rep. No . 1631 , 77th Cong . , 2d Sess . , 165 ( 1942 ) ) . Because “ Congress intended . . . to coordinate the income - tax withholding system with FICA ” in order “ to promote simplicity and ease of administration , ” the Court held that it would be “ extraordinary ” for Congress to intend the definitions of “ wages ” to vary between FICA and income - tax withholding . 452 U. S. , at 257 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The specific holding of Rowan — that regulations governing meals and lodging were invalid — has little or nobearing on the issue confronting us here . What is of im - portance is the major principle recognized in Rowan : that simplicity of administration and consistency of statutory interpretation instruct that the meaning of “ wages ” should be in general the same for income - tax withholding and for FICA calculations .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Quality Stores contends that , under the mandate of § 3402(o ) , severance payments are not subject to FICA taxation but are to be deemed wages for purposes ofincome - tax withholding . It justifies this differential treat - ment in the name of uniformity . But that so - called uniformity as to the definitions of wages ( i.e. , that severance payments are not wages ) is not consistent with the broad textual definitions of wages under FICA and income - tax withholding . Nor is it consistent with this Court ’s holding that administrative reasons justify treating severance payments as taxable for both FICA and income - tax purposes . To read Congress’ command to withhold severance payments as an implicit overruling of the broad definition of wages in FICA would disserve the statutory text and the congressional interest in administrative simplicity deemed controlling in Rowan .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In concluding , the Court notes that the IRS still provides that severance payments tied to the receipt of state unemployment benefits are exempt not only from income - tax withholding but also from FICA taxation . See , e.g. , Rev. Rul . 90–72 , 1990–2 Cum . Bull . 211 . Those Revenue Rulings are not at issue here . Because the severance payments here were not linked to state unemployment benefits , the Court does not reach the question whether the IRS’ current exemption is consistent with the broad definition of wages under FICA .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The severance payments here were made to employees terminated against their will , were varied based on job seniority and time served , and were not linked to the receipt of state unemployment benefits . Under FICA ’s broad definition , these severance payments constitute taxable wages .

In 2006 , Detective William Pedraja of the Miami - Dade Police Department received an unverified tip that mari - juana was being grown in the home of respondent Joelis Jardines .

As Detective Bartelt explained , the dog “ began tracking that airborne odor by . . . tracking back and forth , ” engaging in what is called “ bracketing , ” “ back and forth , back and forth . ” Id. , at A– 33 to A–34 . Detective Bartelt gave the dog “ the full six feet of the leash plus whatever safe distance [ he could ] give him ” to do this — he testified that he needed to give the dog “ as much distance as I can . ” Id. , at A–35 . And Detective Pedraja stood back while this was occurring , so that he would not “ get knocked over ” when the dog was “ spinning around trying to find ” the source . Id. , at A–38 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
After sniffing the base of the front door , the dog sat , which is the trained behavior upon discovering the odor ’s strongest point . Detective Bartelt then pulled the dog away from the door and returned to his vehicle . He left the scene after informing Detective Pedraja that there had been a positive alert for narcotics .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On the basis of what he had learned at the home , De - tective Pedraja applied for and received a warrant to search the residence . When the warrant was executed later that day , Jardines attempted to flee and was arrested ; the search revealed marijuana plants , and he was charged with trafficking in cannabis .	@@empty@@	unmatched
At trial , Jardines moved to suppress the marijuana plants on the ground that the canine investigation was an unreasonable search . The trial court granted the motion , and the Florida Third District Court of Appeal reversed . On a petition for discretionary review , the Florida Supreme Court quashed the decision of the Third District Court of Appeal and approved the trial court ’s decision to suppress , holding ( as relevant here ) that the use of the trained narcotics dog to investigate Jardines’ home wasa Fourth Amendment search unsupported by probable cause , rendering invalid the warrant based upon information gathered in that search . 73 So . 3d 34 ( 2011 ) .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
We granted certiorari , limited to the question of whether the officers’ behavior was a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment . 565 U. S. _ _ _ ( 2012 ) .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
The Fourth Amendment provides in relevant part that the “ right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated . ” The Amendment establishes a simple baseline , one that for much of our history formed the exclusive basis for its protections : When “ the Government obtains information by physically intruding ” on persons , houses , papers , or effects , “ a ‘ search’ within the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment ” has “ un - doubtedly occurred . ” United States v. Jones , 565 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ , n. 3 ( 2012 ) ( slip op . , at 6 , n. 3 ) . By reason ofour decision in Katz v. United States , 389 U. S. 347(1967 ) , property rights “ are not the sole measure of Fourth Amendment violations , ” Soldal v. Cook County , 506 U. S. 56 , 64 ( 1992)—but though Katz may add to the baseline , it does not subtract anything from the Amendment ’s protections “ when the Government does engage in [ a ] physi - cal intrusion of a constitutionally protected area , ” United States v. Knotts , 460 U. S. 276 , 286 ( 1983 ) ( Brennan , J. , concurring in the judgment ) .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
That principle renders this case a straightforward one . The officers were gathering information in an area belonging to Jardines and immediately surrounding his house — in the curtilage of the house , which we have held enjoys protection as part of the home itself . And they gathered that information by physically entering and occupying the area to engage in conduct not explicitly or implicitly permitted by the homeowner .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Fourth Amendment “ indicates with some precision the places and things encompassed by its protections ” : persons , houses , papers , and effects . Oliver v. United States , 466 U. S. 170 , 176 ( 1984 ) . The Fourth Amendment does not , therefore , prevent all investigations conducted on private property ; for example , an officer may ( subject to Katz ) gather information in what we have called “ open fields”—even if those fields are privately owned — because such fields are not enumerated in the Amendment ’s text . Hester v. United States , 265 U. S. 57 ( 1924 ) .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
But when it comes to the Fourth Amendment , the home is first among equals . At the Amendment ’s “ very core ” stands “ the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental in - trusion . ” Silverman v. United States , 365 U. S. 505 , 511 ( 1961 ) . This right would be of little practical value if the State ’s agents could stand in a home ’s porch or side garden and trawl for evidence with impunity ; the right to retreat would be significantly diminished if the police could enter a man ’s property to observe his repose from just outside the front window .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
We therefore regard the area “ immediately surrounding and associated with the home”—what our cases call the curtilage — as “ part of the home itself for Fourth Amendment purposes . ” Oliver , supra , at 180 . That principle has ancient and durable roots . Just as the distinction between the home and the open fields is “ as old as the common law , ” Hester , supra , at 59 , so too is the identity of home and what Blackstone called the “ curtilage or homestall , ” for the “ house protects and privileges all its branches and appurtenants . ” 4 W. Blackstone , Commentaries on the Laws of England 223 , 225 ( 1769 ) . This area around the home is “ intimately linked to the home , both physically and psychologically , ” and is where “ privacy expectations are most heightened . ” California v. Ciraolo , 476 U. S. 207 , 213 ( 1986 ) .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
While the boundaries of the curtilage are generally “ clearly marked , ” the “ conception defining the curtilage ” is at any rate familiar enough that it is “ easily understood from our daily experience . ” Oliver , 466 U. S. , at 182 , n. 12 . Here there is no doubt that the officers entered it : The front porch is the classic exemplar of an area adjacent to the home and “ to which the activity of home life extends . ” Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Since the officers’ investigation took place in a constitutionally protected area , we turn to the question of whether it was accomplished through an unlicensed physical in - trusion . 1 While law enforcement officers need not “ shield their eyes ” when passing by the home “ on public thoroughfares , ” Ciraolo , 476 U. S. , at 213 , an officer ’s leave to gather information is sharply circumscribed when he steps off those thoroughfares and enters the Fourth Amendment ’s protected areas . In permitting , for example , visual observation of the home from “ public navigable airspace , ” we were careful to note that it was done “ in a physically nonintrusive manner . ” Ibid . Entick v. Carrington , 2 Wils . K. B. 275 , 95 Eng . Rep. 807 ( K. B. 1765 ) , a case “ undoubtedly familiar ” to “ every American statesman ” at the time of the Founding , Boyd v. United States , 116 U. S. 616 , 626(1886 ) , states the general rule clearly : “ [ O]ur law holds the property of every man so sacred , that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour ’s close without his leave . ” 2 Wils . K. B. , at 291 , 95 Eng . Rep. , at 817 . As it is undisputed that the detectives had all four of their feet and all four of their companion ’s firmly planted on the constitutionally protected extension of Jardines’ home , the only question is whether he had given his leave ( even implicitly ) for them to do so . He had not .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
“ A license may be implied from the habits of the country , ” notwithstanding the “ strict rule of the English common law as to entry upon a close . ” McKee v. Gratz , 260 U. S. 127 , 136 ( 1922 ) ( Holmes , J. ) . We have accordingly recognized that “ the knocker on the front door is treated as an invitation or license to attempt an entry , justifying ingress to the home by solicitors , hawkers and peddlersof all kinds . ” Breard v. Alexandria , 341 U. S. 622 , 626 ( 1951 ) . This implicit license typically permits the visitor to approach the home by the front path , knock promptly , wait briefly to be received , and then ( absent invitation to linger longer ) leave . Complying with the terms of that traditional invitation does not require fine - grained legal knowledge ; it is generally managed without incident by the Nation ’s Girl Scouts and trick - or - treaters . 2 Thus , a police officer not armed with a warrant may approach a home and knock , precisely because that is “ no more than any private citizen might do . ” Kentucky v. King , 563 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2011 ) ( slip op . , at 16 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
But introducing a trained police dog to explore the area around the home in hopes of discovering incriminating evidence is something else . There is no customary invitation to do that . An invitation to engage in canine forensic investigation assuredly does not inhere in the very act of hanging a knocker . 3 To find a visitor knocking on the door is routine ( even if sometimes unwelcome ) ; to spot that same visitor exploring the front path with a metal detector , or marching his bloodhound into the garden before saying hello and asking permission , would inspire mostof us to — well , call the police . The scope of a license — express or implied — is limited not only to a particular area but also to a specific purpose . Consent at a traffic stop to an officer ’s checking out an anonymous tip that there is a body in the trunk does not permit the officer to rummage through the trunk for narcotics . Here , the background social norms that invite a visitor to the front door do not invite him there to conduct a search . 4	@@empty@@	unmatched
The State points to our decisions holding that the subjective intent of the officer is irrelevant . See Ashcroft v. al - Kidd , 563 U. S. _ _ _ ( 2011 ) ; Whren v. United States , 517 U. S. 806 ( 1996 ) . But those cases merely hold that a stop or search that is objectively reasonable is not vitiated by the fact that the officer ’s real reason for making the stop or search has nothing to do with the validating reason . Thus , the defendant will not be heard to complain that although he was speeding the officer ’s real reason for the stop was racial harassment . See i d . , at 810 , 813 . Here , however , the question before the court is precisely whether the officer ’s conduct was an objectively reasonable search . As we have described , that depends upon whether the officers had an implied license to enter the porch , which in turn depends upon the purpose for which they entered . Here , their behavior objectively reveals a purpose to conduct a search , which is not what anyone would think he had license to do .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The State argues that investigation by a forensic narcotics dog by definition can not implicate any legitimate privacy interest . The State cites for authority our decisions in United States v. Place , 462 U. S. 696 ( 1983 ) , United States v. Jacobsen , 466 U. S. 109 ( 1984 ) , and Illinois v. Caballes , 543 U. S. 405 ( 2005 ) , which held , respectively , that canine inspection of luggage in an airport , chemical testing of a substance that had fallen from a parcel in transit , and canine inspection of an automobile during a lawful traffic stop , do not violate the “ reasonable expectation of privacy ” described in Katz .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Just last Term , we considered an argument much like this . Jones held that tracking an automobile ’s where - abouts using a physically - mounted GPS receiver is a Fourth Amendment search . The Government argued that the Katz standard “ show[ed ] that no search occurred , ” as the defendant had “ no ‘ reasonable expectation of privacy’ ” in his whereabouts on the public roads , Jones , 565 U. S. , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 5)—a proposition with at least as much support in our case law as the one the State marshals here . See , e.g. , United States v. Knotts , 460 U. S. 276 , 278 ( 1983 ) . But because the GPS receiver had been physically mounted on the defendant ’s automobile ( thus intruding on his “ effects ” ) , we held that tracking the vehicle ’s movements was a search : a person ’s “ Fourth Amendment rights do not rise or fall with the Katz formulation . ” Jones , supra , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 5 ) . The Katz reasonable - expectations test “ has been added to , not substitutedfor , ” the traditional property - based understanding of the Fourth Amendment , and so is unnecessary to consider when the government gains evidence by physically intruding on constitutionally protected areas . Jones , supra , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 8) .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
Thus , we need not decide whether the officers’ investigation of Jardines’ home violated his expectation of privacy under Katz . One virtue of the Fourth Amendment’sproperty - rights baseline is that it keeps easy cases easy . That the officers learned what they learned only by physically intruding on Jardines’ property to gather evidence is enough to establish that a search occurred .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
For a related reason we find irrelevant the State ’s argument ( echoed by the dissent ) that forensic dogs have been commonly used by police for centuries . This argument is apparently directed to our holding in Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) , that surveillance ofthe home is a search where “ the Government uses a device that is not in general public use ” to “ explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion . ” Id. , at 40 ( emphasis added ) . But the implication of that statement ( inclusio unius est exclusio alterius ) is that when the government uses a physical intrusion to explore details of the home ( including its curtilage ) , the antiquity of the tools that they bring along is irrelevant .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The government ’s use of trained police dogs to inves - tigate the home and its immediate surroundings is a “ search ” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment . The judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is therefore affirmed .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
For me , a simple analogy clinches this case — and doesso on privacy as well as property grounds . A stranger comes to the front door of your home carrying super - high - powered binoculars . See ante , at 7 , n. 3 . He does n’t knock or say hello . Instead , he stands on the porch and uses the binoculars to peer through your windows , into your home ’s furthest corners . It does n’t take long ( the binoculars are really very fine ) : In just a couple of minutes , his uncommon behavior allows him to learn details of your life you disclose to no one . Has your “ visitor ” trespassed on your property , exceeding the license you have granted to members of the public to , say , drop off the mail or distribute campaign flyers ? Yes , he has . And has he also invaded your “ reasonable expectation of privacy , ” by nosing into intimacies you sensibly thought protected from disclosure ? Katz v. United States , 389 U. S. 347 , 360 ( 1967 ) ( Harlan , J. , concurring ) . Yes , of course , he has done that too .	@@empty@@	unmatched
That case is this case in every way that matters . Here , police officers came to Joelis Jardines’ door with a super - sensitive instrument , which they deployed to detect things inside that they could not perceive unassisted . The equip - ment they used was animal , not mineral . But contra the dissent , see post , at 2 ( opinion of Alito , J. ) ( noting the ubiquity of dogs in American households ) , that is of no significance in determining whether a search occurred . Detective Bartelt ’s dog was not your neighbor ’s pet , come to your porch on a leisurely stroll . As this Court discussed earlier this Term , drug - detection dogs are highly trained tools of law enforcement , geared to respond in distinctive ways to specific scents so as to convey clear and reliable information to their human partners . See Florida v. Harris , 568 U. S. _ _ _ ( 2013 ) ( slip op . at 2–3 , 7–8 ) . They are to the poodle down the street as high - powered binoculars are to a piece of plain glass . Like the binoculars , a drug - detection dog is a specialized device for discovering objects not in plain view ( or plain smell ) . And as in the hypothetical above , that device was aimed here at a home — the most private and inviolate ( or so we expect ) of all the places and things the Fourth Amendment protects . Was this activity a trespass ? Yes , as the Court holds to - day . Was it also an invasion of privacy ? Yes , that as well .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
The Court today treats this case under a property rubric ; I write separately to note that I could just as happily have decided it by looking to Jardines’ privacy interests . A decision along those lines would have looked . . . well , much like this one . It would have talked about “ ‘ the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.’ ” Ante , at 4 ( quoting Silverman v. United States , 365 U. S. 505 , 511 ( 1961 ) ) . It would have insisted on maintaining the “ practical value ” of that right by preventing police officers from standing in an adjacent space and “ trawl[ing ] for evidence with impunity . ” Ante , at 4 . It would have explained that “ ‘ privacy expectations are most heightened’ ” in the home and the surrounding area . Ante , at 4–5 ( quoting California v. Ciraolo , 476 U. S. 207 , 213 ( 1986 ) ) . And it would have determined that police officers invade those shared expectations when they use trained canine assistants to reveal within the confines of a home what they could not otherwise have found there . See ante , at 6–7 , and nn . 2–3 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is not surprising that in a case involving a search of a home , property concepts and privacy concepts should so align . The law of property “ naturally enough influence[s ] ” our “ shared social expectations ” of what places should be free from governmental incursions . Georgia v. Randolph , 547 U. S. 103 , 111 ( 2006 ) ; see Rakas v. Illinois , 439 U. S. 128 , 143 , n. 12 ( 1978 ) . And so the sentiment “ my home is my own , ” while originating in property law , now also denotes a common understanding — extending even beyond that law ’s formal protections — about an especially private sphere . Jardines’ home was his property ; it was also his most intimate and familiar space . The analysis proceeding from each of those facts , as today ’s decision reveals , runs mostly along the same path .	@@empty@@	unmatched
I can think of only one divergence : If we had decided this case on privacy grounds , we would have realized that Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) , already resolved it . 1 The Kyllo Court held that police officers conducted a search when they used a thermal - imaging device to detect heat emanating from a private home , even though they committed no trespass . Highlighting our intention to draw both a “ firm ” and a “ bright ” line at “ the entrance to the house , ” i d . , at 40 , we announced the following rule :	@@empty@@	unmatched
“ Where , as here , the Government uses a device that is not in general public use , to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion , the surveillance is a ‘ search’ and is presumptively unreasonable without a warrant . ” Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
That “ firm ” and “ bright ” rule governs this case : The police officers here conducted a search because they used a“device . . . not in general public use ” ( a trained drug - detection dog ) to “ explore details of the home ” ( the presence of certain substances ) that they would not otherwise have discovered without entering the premises .	@@empty@@	unmatched
And again , the dissent ’s argument that the device is just a dog can not change the equation . As Kyllo made clear , the “ sense - enhancing ” tool at issue may be “ crude ” or “ sophisticated , ” may be old or new ( drug - detection dogs actually go back not “ 12,000 years ” or “ centuries , ” post , at 2 , 8 , 12 , but only a few decades ) , may be either smaller or bigger than a breadbox ; still , “ at least where ( as here ) ” the device is not “ in general public use , ” training it on a home violates our “ minimal expectation of privacy”—an expectation “ that exists , and that is acknowledged to be reasonable . ” 533 U. S. , at 34 , 36 . 2 That does not mean the device is off - limits , as the dissent implies , see post , at 11–12 ; it just means police officers can not use it to examine a home without a warrant or exigent circumstance . See Brigham City v. Stuart , 547 U. S. 398 , 403–404 ( 2006 ) ( describing exigencies allowing the warrantless search of a home ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
With these further thoughts , suggesting that a focus on Jardines’ privacy interests would make an “ easy cas[e ] easy ” twice over , ante , at 10 , I join the Court ’s opinion in full .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court ’s decision in this important Fourth Amendment case is based on a putative rule of trespass law that is nowhere to be found in the annals of Anglo - American jurisprudence .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
The law of trespass generally gives members of the public a license to use a walkway to approach the front door of a house and to remain there for a brief time . This license is not limited to persons who intend to speak to an occupant or who actually do so . ( Mail carriers and persons delivering packages and flyers are examples of individuals who may lawfully approach a front door without intending to converse . ) Nor is the license restricted to categoriesof visitors whom an occupant of the dwelling is likely to welcome ; as the Court acknowledges , this license applies even to “ solicitors , hawkers and peddlers of all kinds . ” Ante , at 6 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . And the license even extends to police officers who wish to gather evidence against an occupant ( by asking potentially incriminating questions ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
According to the Court , however , the police officer in this case , Detective Bartelt , committed a trespass because he was accompanied during his otherwise lawful visit to the front door of respondent ’s house by his dog , Franky . Where is the authority evidencing such a rule ? Dogs have been domesticated for about 12,000 years ; 1 they were ubiquitous in both this country and Britain at the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment ; 2 and their acute sense of smell has been used in law enforcement for centuries . 3 Yet the Court has been unable to find a single case — from the United States or any other common - law nation — that supports the rule on which its decision is based . Thus , trespass law provides no support for the Court ’s holding today .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
The Court ’s decision is also inconsistent with thereasonable - expectations - of - privacy test that the Court adopted in Katz v. United States , 389 U. S. 347 ( 1967 ) . A reasonable person understands that odors emanating from a house may be detected from locations that are open to the public , and a reasonable person will not count on the strength of those odors remaining within the range that , while detectible by a dog , can not be smelled by a human .	@@empty@@	unmatched
For these reasons , I would hold that no search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment took place in this case , and I would reverse the decision below .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
The opinion of the Court may leave a reader with the mistaken impression that Detective Bartelt and Franky remained on respondent ’s property for a prolonged period of time and conducted a far - flung exploration of the front yard . See ante , at 4 ( “ trawl for evidence with impunity”),7 ( “ marching his bloodhound into the garden ” ) . But thatis not what happened .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Detective Bartelt and Franky approached the front door via the driveway and a paved path — the route that any visitor would customarily use 4 —and Franky was on the kind of leash that any dog owner might employ . 5 As Franky approached the door , he started to track an airborne odor . He held his head high and began “ bracketing ” the area ( pacing back and forth ) in order to determine the strongest source of the smell . App . 95–96 . Detective Bartelt knew “ the minute [ he ] observed ” this behavior that Franky had detected drugs . Id. , at 95 . Upon locating the odor ’s strongest source , Franky sat at the base of the front door , and at this point , Detective Bartelt and Franky im - mediately returned to their patrol car . Id. , at 98 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A critical fact that the Court omits is that , as respondent ’s counsel explained at oral argument , this entireprocess — walking down the driveway and front path to the front door , waiting for Franky to find the strongest source of the odor , and walking back to the car — took approximately a minute or two . Tr . of Oral Arg . 57–58 . Thus , the amount of time that Franky and the detective remainedat the front porch was even less . The Court also fails to mention that , while Detective Bartelt apparently did not personally smell the odor of marijuana coming from the house , another officer who subsequently stood on the front porch , Detective Pedraja , did notice that smell and was able to identify it . App . 81 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court concludes that the conduct in this case was a search because Detective Bartelt exceeded the boundaries of the license to approach the house that is recognized by the law of trespass , but the Court ’s interpretation of the scope of that license is unfounded .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is said that members of the public may lawfully proceed along a walkway leading to the front door of a house because custom grants them a license to do so . Breard v. Alexandria , 341 U. S. 622 , 626 ( 1951 ) ; Lakin v. Ames , 64 Mass. 198 , 220 ( 1852 ) ; J. Bishop , Commentaries on the Non - Contract Law § 823 , p. 378 ( 1889 ) . This rule encompasses categories of visitors whom most homeowners almost certainly wish to allow to approach their front doors — friends , relatives , mail carriers , persons making deliveries . But it also reaches categories of visitors who are less universally welcome—“solicitors , ” “ hawkers , ” “ peddlers , ” and the like . The law might attempt to draw fine lines between categories of welcome and unwelcome visitors , distinguishing , for example , between tolerable and intolerable door - to - door peddlers ( Girl Scouts selling cookies versus adults selling aluminum siding ) or be - tween police officers on agreeable and disagreeable missions ( gathering information about a bothersome neighbor versus asking potentially incriminating questions ) . But the law of trespass has not attempted such a difficult taxonomy . See Desnick v. American Broadcasting Cos . , 44 F. 3d 1345 , 1351 ( CA7 1995 ) ( “ [ C]onsent to an entry is often given legal effect even though the entrant has intentions that if known to the owner of the property would cause him for perfectly understandable and generally ethical or at least lawful reasons to revoke his consent ” ) ; cf . Skinner v. Ogallala Public School Dist . , 262 Neb. 387 , 402 , 631 N. W. 2d 510 , 525 ( 2001 ) ( “ [ I]n order to determine if a business invitation is implied , the inquiry is not a subjective assessment of why the visitor chose to visit the premises in a particular instance ” ) ; Crown Cork & Seal Co. v. Kane , 213 Md. 152 , 159 , 131 A. 2d 470 , 473–474 ( 1957 ) ( noting that “ there are many cases in which an invitation has been implied from circumstances , such as custom , ” and that this test is “ objective in that it stresses custom and the appearance of things ” as opposed to “ the undisclosed intention of the visitor ” ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Of course , this license has certain spatial and temporal limits . A visitor must stick to the path that is typically used to approach a front door , such as a paved walkway . A visitor can not traipse through the garden , meander into the backyard , or take other circuitous detours that veer from the pathway that a visitor would customarily use . See , e.g. , Robinson v. Virginia , 47 Va. App . 533 , 549–550 , 625 S. E. 2d 651 , 659 ( 2006 ) ( en banc ) ; United States v. Wells , 648 F. 3d 671 , 679–680 ( CA8 2011 ) ( police exceeded scope of their implied invitation when they bypassed the front door and proceeded directly to the back yard ) ; State v. Harris , 919 S. W. 2d 619 , 624 ( Tenn. Crim . App . 1995 ) ( “ Any substantial and unreasonable departure from an area where the public is impliedly invited exceeds the scope of the implied invitation . . . ” ( internal quotation marks and brackets omitted ) ) ; 1 W. LaFave , Search and Seizure § 2.3(c ) , p. 578 ( 2004 ) ( hereinafter LaFave ) ; i d . , § 2.3(f ) , at 600–603 ( “ [ W]hen the police come on to private property to conduct an investigation or for some other legitimate purpose and restrict their movements to places visitors could be expected to go ( e.g. , walkways , drive - ways , porches ) , observations made from such vantage points are not covered by the Fourth Amendment ” ( footnotes omitted ) ) .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
Nor , as a general matter , may a visitor come to the front door in the middle of the night without an express invitation . See State v. Cada , 129 Idaho 224 , 233 , 923 P. 2d 469 , 478 ( App . 1996 ) ( “ Furtive intrusion late at night or in the predawn hours is not conduct that is expected from ordinary visitors . Indeed , if observed by a resident of the premises , it could be a cause for great alarm ” ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Similarly , a visitor may not linger at the front door for an extended period . See 9 So . 3d 1 , 11 ( Fla. App . 2008 ) ( case below ) ( Cope , J. , concurring in part and dissenting in part ) ( “ [ T]here is no such thing as squatter ’s rights on a front porch . A stranger may not plop down uninvited to spend the afternoon in the front porch rocking chair , or throw down a sleeping bag to spend the night , or lurk on the front porch , looking in the windows ” ) . The license is limited to the amount of time it would customarily take to approach the door , pause long enough to see if someone is home , and ( if not expressly invited to stay longer ) , leave .	@@empty@@	unmatched
As I understand the law of trespass and the scope of the implied license , a visitor who adheres to these limitations is not necessarily required to ring the doorbell , knock on the door , or attempt to speak with an occupant . For example , mail carriers , persons making deliveries , and in - dividuals distributing flyers may leave the items theyare carrying and depart without making any attempt to converse . A pedestrian or motorist looking for a particular address may walk up to a front door in order to check a house number that is hard to see from the sidewalk or road . A neighbor who knows that the residents are away may approach the door to retrieve an accumulation of newspapers that might signal to a potential burglar that the house is unoccupied .	@@empty@@	unmatched
As the majority acknowledges , this implied license to approach the front door extends to the police . See ante , at 6 . As we recognized in Kentucky v. King , 563 U. S. _ _ _ ( 2011 ) , police officers do not engage in a search when they approach the front door of a residence and seek to engage in what is termed a “ knock and talk , ” i.e. , knocking on the door and seeking to speak to an occupant for the purpose of gathering evidence . See i d . , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 16 ) ( “ When law enforcement officers who are not armed with a warrant knock on a door , they do no more than any private citizen might do ” ) . See also 1 LaFave § 2.3(e ) , at 592 ( “ It is not objectionable for an officer to come upon that part of the property which has been opened to public common use ” ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) . Even when the objective of a “ knock and talk ” is to obtain evidence that will lead to the homeowner ’s arrest and prosecution , the license to approach still applies . In other words , gathering evidence — even damning evidence — is a lawful activity that falls within the scope of the license to approach . And when officers walk up to the front door of a house , they are permitted to see , hear , and smell whatever can be detected from a lawful vantage point . California v. Ciraolo , 476 U. S. 207 , 213 ( 1986 ) ( “ The Fourth Amendment protection of the home has never been extended to require law enforcement officers to shield their eyes when passing by a home on public thoroughfares ” ) ; Cada , supra , at 232 , 923 P. 2d , at 477 ( “ [ P]olice officers restricting their activity to [ areas to which the public is impliedly invited ] are permitted the same intrusion and the same levelof observation as would be expected from a reasonably respectful citizen ” ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) ; 1 LaFave § § 2.2(a ) , 2.3(c ) , at 450–452 , 572–577 .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
Detective Bartelt did not exceed the scope of the license to approach respondent ’s front door . He adhered to the customary path ; he did not approach in the middle of the night ; and he remained at the front door for only a very short period ( less than a minute or two ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court concludes that Detective Bartelt went too far because he had the “ objectiv[e ] . . . purpose to conduct a search . ” Ante , at 8 ( emphasis added ) . What this means , I take it , is that anyone aware of what Detective Bartelt did would infer that his subjective purpose was to gather evidence . But if this is the Court ’s point , then a standard “ knock and talk ” and most other police visits would likewise constitute searches . With the exception of visits to serve warrants or civil process , police almost always approach homes with a purpose of discovering information . That is certainly the objective of a “ knock and talk . ” The Court offers no meaningful way of distinguishing the “ objective purpose ” of a “ knock and talk ” from the “ objective purpose ” of Detective Bartelt ’s conduct here .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court contends that a “ knock and talk ” is different because it involves talking , and “ all are invited ” to do that . Ante , at 7–8 , n. 4 ( emphasis deleted ) . But a police officer who approaches the front door of a house in accordance with the limitations already discussed may gather evidence by means other than talking . The officer may observe items in plain view and smell odors coming from the house . Ciraolo , supra , at 213 ; Cada , 129 Idaho , at 232 , 923 P. 2d , at 477 ; 1 LaFave § § 2.2(a ) , 2.3(c ) , at 450–452 , 572–577 . So the Court ’s “ objective purpose ” argument can not stand .	@@empty@@	unmatched
What the Court must fall back on , then , is the particular instrument that Detective Bartelt used to detect the odor of marijuana , namely , his dog . But in the entire body of common - law decisions , the Court has not found a single case holding that a visitor to the front door of a home commits a trespass if the visitor is accompanied by a dog on a leash . On the contrary , the common law allowed even unleashed dogs to wander on private property without committing a trespass . G. Williams , Liability for Animals 136–146 ( 1939 ) ; J. Ingham , A Treatise on Property in Animals Wild and Domestic and the Rights and Respon - sibilities Arising Therefrom 277–278 ( 1900 ) . Cf . B. Markesinis & S. Deakin , Tort Law 511 ( 4th ed . 1999 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Court responds that “ [ i]t is not the dog that is the problem , but the behavior that here involved use of the dog . ” Ante , at 7 , n. 3 . But where is the support in the law of trespass for this proposition ? Dogs’ keen sense of smell has been used in law enforcement for centuries . The antiquity of this practice is evidenced by a Scottish law from 1318 that made it a crime to “ disturb a tracking dog or the men coming with it for pursuing thieves or seizing malefactors . ” K. Brown et al . , The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707 , ( St Andrews , 2007–2013 ) , online at http://www.rps.ac.uk/mss/1318/9 . If bringing a tracking dog to the front door of a home constituted a trespass , one would expect at least one case to have arisen during the past 800 years . But the Court has found none .	@@empty@@	unmatched
For these reasons , the real law of trespass provides no support for the Court ’s holding today . While the Court claims that its reasoning has “ ancient and durableroots , ” ante , at 4 , its trespass rule is really a newly struck counterfeit .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The concurring opinion attempts to provide an alternative ground for today ’s decision , namely , that Detective Bartelt ’s conduct violated respondent ’s reasonable expectations of privacy . But we have already rejected a very similar , if not identical argument , see Illinois v. Caballes , 543 U. S. 405 , 409–410 ( 2005 ) , and in any event I see no basis for concluding that the occupants of a dwelling have a reasonable expectation of privacy in odors that emanate from the dwelling and reach spots where members of the public may lawfully stand .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is clear that the occupant of a house has no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to odors that can be smelled by human beings who are standing in such places . See United States v. Johns , 469 U. S. 478 , 482 ( 1985 ) ( “ After the officers came closer and detected the distinct odor of marihuana , they had probable cause to believethat the vehicles contained contraband ” ) ; United Statesv . Ventresca , 380 U. S. 102 , 111 ( 1965 ) ( scent of ferment - ing mash supported probable cause for warrant ) ; United States v. Johnston , 497 F. 2d 397 , 398 ( CA9 1974 ) ( thereis no “ reasonable expectation of privacy from drug agents with inquisitive nostrils ” ) . And I would not draw a line between odors that can be smelled by humans and those that are detectible only by dogs .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Consider the situation from the point of view of the occupant of a building in which marijuana is grown or methamphetamine is manufactured . Would such an oc - cupant reason as follows ? “ I know that odors may emanate from my building and that atmospheric conditions , such as the force and direction of the wind , may affect the strength of those odors when they reach a spot where members of the public may lawfully stand . I also know that some people have a much more acute sense of smell than others , 6 and I have no idea who might be standing in one of the spots in question when the odors from my house reach that location . In addition , I know that odors coming from my building , when they reach these locations , may be strong enough to be detected by a dog . But I am confident that they will be so faint that they can not be smelled by any human being . ” Such a finely tuned expectation would be entirely unrealistic , and I see no evidence that society is prepared to recognize it as reasonable .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In an attempt to show that respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the odor of marijuana wafting from his house , the concurrence argues that this case is just like Kyllo v. United States , 533 U. S. 27 ( 2001 ) , which held that police officers conducted a search when they used a thermal imaging device to detect heat emanating from a house . Ante , at 3–4 ( opinion of Kagan , J. ) . This Court , however , has already rejected the argument that the use of a drug - sniffing dog is the same as the use of a thermal imaging device . See Caballes , 543 U. S. , at 409–410 . The very argument now advanced by the concurrence appears in Justice Souter ’s Caballes dissent . See i d . , at 413 , and n. 3 . But the Court was not persuaded .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Contrary to the interpretation propounded by the concurrence , Kyllo is best understood as a decision about the use of new technology . The Kyllo Court focused on the fact that the thermal imaging device was a form of “ sense - enhancing technology ” that was “ not in general public use , ” and it expressed concern that citizens would be “ at the mercy of advancing technology ” if its use was not restricted . 533 U. S. , at 34–35 . A dog , however , is not a new form of “ technology or a “ device . ” And , as noted , the use of dogs’ acute sense of smell in law enforcement dates back many centuries .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The concurrence suggests that a Kyllo - based decision would be “ much like ” the actual decision of the Court , but that is simply not so . The holding of the Court is based on what the Court sees as a “ ‘ physical intrusion of a constitutionally protected area.’ ” Ante , at 3 ( quoting United States v. Knotts , 460 U. S. 276 , 286 ( 1983 ) ( Brennan , J. , concurring in judgment ) ) . As a result , it does not apply when a dog alerts while on a public sidewalk or street or in the corridor of a building to which the dog and handler have been lawfully admitted .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The concurrence ’s Kyllo - based approach would have a much wider reach . When the police used the thermal imaging device in Kyllo , they were on a public street , 533 U. S. , at 29 , and “ committed no trespass . ” Ante , at 3 . Therefore , if a dog ’s nose is just like a thermal imaging device for Fourth Amendment purposes , a search would occur if a dog alerted while on a public sidewalk or in the corridor of an apartment building . And the same would be true if the dog was trained to sniff , not for marijuana , but for more dangerous quarry , such as explosives or for a violent fugitive or kidnaped child . I see no ground for hampering legitimate law enforcement in this way .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
The conduct of the police officer in this case did not constitute a trespass and did not violate respondent ’s reasonable expectations of privacy . I would hold that this conduct was not a search , and I therefore respectfully dissent .	@@empty@@	unmatched

The Federal Arbitration Act ( FAA or Act ) requires courts to place arbitration agreements “ on equal footing with all other contracts . ” DIRECTV , Inc. v. Imburgia , 577 U.

In the decision below , the Kentucky Supreme Court declined to give effect to two arbitration agreements executed by individuals holding “ powers of attorney”—that is , authorizations to act on behalf of others . According to the court , a general grant of power ( even if seemingly comprehensive ) does not permit a legal representative to enter into an arbitration agreement for someone else ; to form such a contract , the representative must possess specific authority to “ waive his principal ’s fundamental constitutional rights to access the courts [ and ] to trial by jury . ” Extendicare Homes , Inc. v.

At all times relevant to this case , Beverly and Janis each held a power of attorney , designating her as an “ attorney - in - fact ” ( the one for Joe , the other for Olive ) and affording her broad authority to manage her family member ’s affairs . In the Wellner power of attorney , Joe gave Beverly the authority , “ in my name , place and stead , ” to ( among other things ) “ institute legal proceedings ” and make “ contracts of every nature in relation to both real and personal property . ” App . 10–11 . In the Clark power of attorney , Olive provided Janis with “ full power . . . to transact , handle , and dispose of all matters affecting me and/or my estate in any possible way , ” including the power to “ draw , make , and sign in my name any and all . . . contracts , deeds , or agreements . ” Id. , at 7 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Joe and Olive moved into the Winchester Centre in 2008 , with Beverly and Janis using their powers of attorney to complete all necessary paperwork . As part of that process , Beverly and Janis each signed an arbitration agreement with Kindred on behalf of her relative . The two contracts , worded identically , provided that “ [ a]ny and all claims or controversies arising out of or in any way relating to . . . the Resident ’s stay at the Facility ” would be resolved through “ binding arbitration ” rather than a lawsuit . Id. , at 14 , 21 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
When Joe and Olive died the next year , their estates ( represented again by Beverly and Janis ) brought separate suits against Kindred in Kentucky state court . The complaints alleged that Kindred had delivered substandard care to Joe and Olive , causing their deaths . Kindred moved to dismiss the cases , arguing that the arbitration agreements Beverly and Janis had signed prohibited bringing their disputes to court . But the trial court denied Kindred ’s motions , and the Kentucky Court of Appeals agreed that the estates’ suits could go forward . See App . to Pet . for Cert . 125a–126a , 137a–138a .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Kentucky Supreme Court , after consolidating the cases , affirmed those decisions by a divided vote . See 478 S. W. 3d , at 313 . The court began with the language of the two powers of attorney . The Wellner document , the court stated , did not permit Beverly to enter into an arbitration agreement on Joe ’s behalf . In the court ’s view , neither the provision authorizing her to bring legal proceedings nor the one enabling her to make property - related contracts reached quite that distance . See i d . , at 325–326 ; supra , at 2 . By contrast , the court thought , the Clark power of attorney extended that far and beyond . Under that document , after all , Janis had the capacity to “ dispose of all matters ” affecting Olive . See supra , at 2 . “ Given this extremely broad , universal delegation of authority , ” the court acknowledged , “ it would be impossible to say that entering into [ an ] arbitration agreement was not covered . ” 478 S. W. 3d , at 327 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
And yet , the court went on , both arbitration agreements — Janis ’s no less than Beverly’s — were invalid . That was because a power of attorney could not entitle a representative to enter into an arbitration agreement without specifically saying so . The Kentucky Constitution , the court explained , protects the rights of access to the courts and trial by jury ; indeed , the jury guarantee is the sole right the Constitution declares “ sacred ” and “ inviolate . ” Id. , at 328–329 . Accordingly , the court held , an agent could deprive her principal of an “ adjudication by judge or jury ” only if the power of attorney “ expressly so provide[d ] . ” Id. , at 329 . And that clear - statement rule — so said the court — complied with the FAA ’s demands . True enough that the Act precludes “ singl[ing ] out arbitration agreements . ” Ibid . ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . But that was no problem , the court asserted , because its rule would apply not just to those agreements , but also to some other contracts implicating “ fundamental constitutional rights . ” Id. , at 328 . In the future , for example , the court would bar the holder of a “ non - specific ” power of attorney from entering into a contract “ bind[ing ] the principal to personal servitude . ” Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Justice Abramson dissented , in an opinion joined by two of her colleagues . In their view , the Kentucky Supreme Court ’s new clear - statement rule was “ clearly not . . . applicable to ‘ any contract’ but [ instead ] single[d ] out arbitration agreements for disfavored treatment . ” Id. , at 344–345 .

The FAA makes arbitration agreements “ valid , irrevocable , and enforceable , save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract . ” 9 U. S. C. § 2 . That statutory provision establishes an equal - treatment principle : A court may invalidate an arbitration agreement based on “ generally applicable contract defenses ” like fraud or unconscionability , but not on legal rules that “ apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue . ” AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion , 563 U. S. 333 , 339 ( 2011 ) . The FAA thus preempts any state rule discriminating on its face against arbitration — for example , a “ law prohibit[ing ] outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim . ” Id. , at 341 . And not only that : The Act also displaces any rule that covertly accomplishes the same objective by disfavoring contracts that ( oh so coinciden - tally ) have the defining features of arbitration agreements . In Concepcion , for example , we described a hypothetical state law declaring unenforceable any contract that “ disallow[ed ] an ultimate disposition [ of a dispute ] by a jury . ” Id. , at 342 . Such a law might avoid referring to arbitration by name ; but still , we explained , it would “ rely on the uniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate as [ its ] basis”—and thereby violate the FAA . Id. , at 341 ( quoting Perry v. Thomas , 482 U. S. 483 , 493 , n. 9 ( 1987 ) ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Kentucky Supreme Court ’s clear - statement rule , in just that way , fails to put arbitration agreements on an equal plane with other contracts . By the court ’s own account , that rule ( like the one Concepcion posited ) serves to safeguard a person ’s “ right to access the courts and to trial by jury . ” 478 S. W. 3d , at 327 ; see supra , at 3–4 . In ringing terms , the court affirmed the jury right ’s unsurpassed standing in the State Constitution : The framers , the court explained , recognized “ that right and that right alone as a divine God - given right ” when they made it “ the only thing ” that must be “ ‘ held sacred’ ” and “ ‘ inviolate.’ ” 478 S. W. 3d , at 328–329 ( quoting Ky. Const . § 7 ) . So it was that the court required an explicit statement before an attorney - in - fact , even if possessing broad delegated powers , could relinquish that right on another ’s behalf . See 478 S. W. 3d , at 331 ( “ We say only that an agent ’s authority to waive his principal ’s constitutional right to access the courts and to trial by jury must be clearly expressed by the principal ” ) . And so it was that the court did exactly what Concepcion barred : adopt a legal rule hinging on the primary characteristic of an arbitration agreement — namely , a waiver of the right to go to court and receive a jury trial . See 563 U. S. , at 341–342 ; see also 478 S. W. 3d , at 353 ( Abramson , J. , dissenting ) ( noting that the jury - trial right at the core of “ the majority ’s new rule ” is “ the one right that just happens to be correlative to the right to arbitrate ” ( emphasis deleted ) ) . Such a rule is too tailor - made to arbitration agreements — subjecting them , by virtue of their defining trait , to uncommon barriers — to survive the FAA ’s edict against singling out those contracts for disfavored treatment . 1	@@empty@@	unmatched
And the state court ’s sometime - attempt to cast the rule in broader terms can not salvage its decision . The clear - statement requirement , the court suggested , could also apply when an agent endeavored to waive other “ fundamental constitutional rights ” held by a principal . 478 S. W. 3d , at 331 ; see supra , at 4 . But what other rights , really ? No Kentucky court , so far as we know , has ever before demanded that a power of attorney explicitly confer authority to enter into contracts implicating constitutional guarantees . Nor did the opinion below indicate that such a grant would be needed for the many routine contracts — executed day in and day out by legal representatives — meeting that description . For example , the Kentucky Constitution protects the “ inherent and inalienable ” rights to “ acquir[e ] and protect [ ] property ” and to “ freely communicat[e ] thoughts and opinions . ” Ky. Const . § 1 . But the state court nowhere cautioned that an attorney - in - fact would now need a specific authorization to , say , sell her principal ’s furniture or commit her principal to a non - disclosure agreement . ( And were we in the business of giving legal advice , we would tell the agent not to worry . ) Rather , the court hypothesized a slim set of both patently objectionable and utterly fanciful contracts that would be subject to its rule : No longer could a representative lacking explicit authorization waive her “ principal ’s right to worship freely ” or “ consent to an arranged marriage ” or “ bind [ her ] principal to personal servitude . ” 478 S. W. 3d , at 328 ; see supra , at 4 . Placing arbitration agreements within that class reveals the kind of “ hostility to arbitration ” that led Congress to enact the FAA . Concepcion , 563 U. S. , at 339 . And doing so only makes clear the arbitration - specific character of the rule , much as if it were made applicable to arbitration agreements and black swans . 2	@@empty@@	unmatched
The respondents , Janis and Beverly , primarily advance a different argument — based on the distinction between contract formation and contract enforcement — to support the decision below . Kentucky ’s clear - statement rule , they begin , affects only contract formation , because it bars agents without explicit authority from entering into arbitration agreements . And in their view , the FAA has “ no application ” to “ contract formation issues . ” Supp . Brief for Respondents 1 . The Act , to be sure , requires a State to enforce all arbitration agreements ( save on generally applicable grounds ) once they have come into being . But , the respondents claim , States have free rein to decide — irrespective of the FAA ’s equal - footing principle — whether such contracts are validly created in the first instance . See i d . , at 3 ( “ The FAA ’s statutory framework applies only after a court has determined that a valid arbitration agreement was formed ” ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Both the FAA ’s text and our case law interpreting it say otherwise . The Act ’s key provision , once again , states that an arbitration agreement must ordinarily be treated as “ valid , irrevocable , and enforceable . ” 9 U. S. C. § 2 ; see supra , at 4 . By its terms , then , the Act cares not only about the “ enforce[ment ] ” of arbitration agreements , but also about their initial “ valid[ity]”—that is , about what it takes to enter into them . Or said otherwise : A rule selectively finding arbitration contracts invalid because improperly formed fares no better under the Act than a rule selectively refusing to enforce those agreements once properly made . Precedent confirms that point . In Concepcion , we noted the impermissibility of applying a contract defense like duress “ in a fashion that disfavors arbitration . ” 563 U. S. , at 341 . But the doctrine of duress , as we have elsewhere explained , involves “ unfair dealing at the contract formation stage . ” Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. v. Public Util . Dist . No . 1 of Snohomish Cty . , 554 U. S. 527 , 547 ( 2008 ) . Our discussion of duress would have made no sense if the FAA , as the respondents contend , had nothing to say about contract formation .	@@empty@@	unmatched
And still more : Adopting the respondents’ view would make it trivially easy for States to undermine the Act — indeed , to wholly defeat it . As the respondents have acknowledged , their reasoning would allow States to pronounce any attorney - in - fact incapable of signing an arbitration agreement — even if a power of attorney specifically authorized her to do so . See Tr . of Oral Arg . 27 . ( After all , such a rule would speak to only the contract ’s formation . ) And why stop there ? If the respondents were right , States could just as easily declare everyone incompetent to sign arbitration agreements . ( That rule too would address only formation . ) The FAA would then mean nothing at all — its provisions rendered helpless to prevent even the most blatant discrimination against arbitration .	@@empty@@	unmatched

As noted earlier , the state court held that the Clark power of attorney was sufficiently broad to cover executing an arbitration agreement . See supra , at 3 . The court invalidated the agreement with Kindred only because the power of attorney did not specifically authorize Janis to enter into it on Olive ’s behalf . In other words , the decision below was based exclusively on the clear - statement rule that we have held violates the FAA . So the court must now enforce the Clark - Kindred arbitration agreement .	@@empty@@	unmatched
By contrast , our decision might not require such a result in the Wellner case . The Kentucky Supreme Court began its opinion by stating that the Wellner power of attorney was insufficiently broad to give Beverly the authority to execute an arbitration agreement for Joe . See supra , at 3 . If that interpretation of the document is wholly independent of the court ’s clear - statement rule , then nothing we have said disturbs it . But if that rule at all influenced the construction of the Wellner power of attorney , then the court must evaluate the document ’s meaning anew . The court ’s opinion leaves us uncertain as to whether such an impermissible taint occurred . We therefore vacate the judgment below and return the case to the state court for further consideration . See Marmet Health Care Center , Inc. v. Brown , 565 U. S. 530 , 534 ( 2012 ) ( per curiam ) ( vacating and remanding another arbitration decision because we could not tell “ to what degree [ an ] alternative holding was influenced by ” the state court ’s erroneous , arbitration - specific rule ) . On remand , the court should determine whether it adheres , in the absence of its clear - statement rule , to its prior reading of the Wellner power of attorney .	@@empty@@	unmatched

MR . JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The grave question presented by the petition for certiorari , granted in forma pauperis , [ n1 ] is whether proceedings in which confessions were utilized , and which culminated in sentences of death upon four young negro men in the State of Florida , failed to afford the safeguard of that due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment . [ n2 ] [ p228 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
First . The State of Florida challenges our jurisdiction to look behind the judgments below , claiming that the issues of fact upon which petitioners base their claim that due process was denied them have been finally determined because passed upon by a jury . However , use by a State of an improperly obtained confession may constitute a denial of due process of law as guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment . [ n3 ] Since petitioners have seasonably asserted the right under the federal Constitution to have their guilt or innocence of a capital crime determined without reliance upon confessions obtained by means [ p229 ] proscribed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment , we must determine independently whether petitioners ' confessions were so obtained , by review of the facts upon which that issue necessarily turns .

About nine o'clock on the night of Saturday , May 13 , 1933 , Robert Darsey , an elderly white man , was robbed and murdered in Pompano , Florida , a small town in Broward County about twelve miles from Fort Lauderdale , the Count seat . The opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida affirming petitioners ' conviction for this crime stated that " It was one of those crimes that induced an enraged community . . . . " [ n5 ] And , as the dissenting judge pointed out ,	@@empty@@	unmatched
Between 9:30 and 10 o'clock after the murder , petitioner Charlie Davis was arrested , and , within the next twenty - four hours , from twenty - five to forty negroes living in the community , including petitioners Williamson , Chambers , and Woodward , were arrested without warrants and confined in the Broward County jail , at Fort Lauderdale . On the night of the crime , attempts to trail the murderers by bloodhounds brought J. T. Williams , a convict guard , into the proceedings . From then until confessions were obtained and petitioners were sentenced , he took a prominent part . About 11 P.M. on the following Monday , May 15 , the sheriff and Williams took several of the imprisoned negroes , including Williamson and Chambers , to the Dade County jail at Miami . The [ p230 ] sheriff testified that they were taken there because he felt a possibility of mob violence , and " wanted to give protection to every prisoner . . . in jail . " Evidence of petitioners was that , on the way to Miami , a motorcycle patrolman drew up to the car in which the men were riding , and the sheriff " told the cop that he had some negroes that he -- [ was ] taking down to Miami to escape a mob . " This statement was not denied by the sheriff in his testimony , and Williams did not testify at all ; Williams apparently has now disappeared . Upon order of Williams , petitioner Williamson was kept in the death cell of the Dade County jail . The prisoners thus spirited to Miami were returned to the Fort Lauderdale jail the next day , Tuesday .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is clear from the evidence of both the State and petitioners that from Sunday , May 14 , to Saturday , May 20 , the thirty to forty negro suspects were subjected to questioning and cross - questioning ( with the exception that several of the suspects were in Dade County jail over one night ) . From the afternoon of Saturday , May 20 , until sunrise of the 21st , petitioners and possibly one or two others underwent persistent and repeated questioning . The Supreme Court of Florida said the questioning " was in progress several days and all night before the confessions were secured , " and referred to the last night as an " all - night vigil . " The sheriff who supervised the procedure of continued interrogation testified that he questioned the prisoners " in the day time all the week , " but did not question them during any night before the all - night vigil of Saturday , May 20 , because , after having " questioned them all day . . . , [ he ] was tired . " Other evidence of the State was " that the officers of Broward County were in that jail almost continually during the whole week questioning these boys , and other boys , in connection with this " case . [ p231 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
The process of repeated questioning took place in the jailer 's quarters on the fourth floor of the jail . During the week following their arrest and until their confessions were finally acceptable to the State 's Attorney in the early dawn of Sunday , May 21st , petitioners and their fellow prisoners were led one at a time from their cells to the questioning room , quizzed , and returned to their cells to await another turn . So far as appears , the prisoners at no time during the week were permitted to see or confer with counsel or a single friend or relative . When carried singly from his cell and subjected to questioning , each found himself , a single prisoner , surrounded in a fourth floor jail room by four to ten men , the county sheriff , his deputies , a convict guard , and other white officers and citizens of the community .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The testimony is in conflict as to whether all four petitioners were continually threatened and physically mistreated until they finally , in hopeless desperation and fear of their lives , agreed to confess on Sunday morning just after daylight . Be that as it may , it is certain that , by Saturday , May 20th , five days of continued questioning had elicited no confession . Admittedly , a concentration of effort -- directed against a small number of prisoners including petitioners -- on the part of the questioners , principally the sheriff and Williams , the convict guard , began about 3:30 that Saturday afternoon . From that hour on , with only short intervals for food and rest for the questioners -- " They all stayed up all night . " " They bring one of them at a time backwards and forwards . . . until they confessed . " And Williams was present and participating that night , during the whole of which the jail cook served coffee and sandwiches to the men who " grilled " the prisoners .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Sometime in the early hours of Sunday , the 21st , probably about 2:30 A.M. , Woodward apparently " broke"-- [ p232 ] as one of the state 's witnesses put it -- after a fifteen or twenty minute period of questioning by Williams , the sheriff and the constable " one right after the other . " The State 's Attorney was awakened at his home , and called to the jail . He came , but was dissatisfied with the confession of Woodward which he took down in writing at that time , and said something like " tear this paper up , that is n't what I want , when you get something worthwhile , call me . " [ n7 ] This same State 's Attorney conducted the state 's case in the circuit court below and also made himself a witness , but did not testify as to why Woodward 's [ p233 ] first alleged confession was unsatisfactory to him . The sheriff did , however :	@@empty@@	unmatched
After one week 's constant denial of all guilt , petitioners " broke . "	@@empty@@	unmatched
Just before sunrise , the state officials got something " worthwhile " from petitioners which the State 's Attorney would " want " ; again he was called ; he came ; in the presence of those who had carried on and witnessed the all - night questioning , he caused his questions and petitioners ' answers to be stenographically reported . These are the confessions utilized by the State to obtain the judgments upon which petitioners were sentenced to death . No formal charges had been brought before the confessions . Two days thereafter , petitioners were indicted , were arraigned and Williamson and Woodward pleaded guilty ; Chambers and Davis pleaded not guilty . Later the sheriff , accompanied by Williams , informed an attorney who presumably had been appointed to defend Davis that Davis wanted his plea of not guilty withdrawn . This was done , and Davis then pleaded guilty . When Chambers was tried , his conviction rested upon his confession and testimony of the other three confessors . The convict guard and the sheriff " were in the Court room sitting down in a seat . " And from arrest until sentenced to death , petitioners were never -- either in jail or in court -- wholly removed from the constant observation , influence , custody and control of those whose persistent pressure brought about the sunrise confessions .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Third . The scope and operation of the Fourteenth Amendment have been fruitful sources of controversy in our constitutional history . [ n8 ] However , in view of its historical [ p236 ] setting and the wrongs which called it into being , the due process provision of the Fourteenth Amendment -- just as that , in the Fifth -- has led few to doubt that it was intended to guarantee procedural standards adequate and appropriate , then and thereafter , [ n9 ] to protect , at all times , people charged with or suspected of crime by those holding positions of power and authority . Tyrannical governments had immemorially utilized dictatorial criminal procedure and punishment to make scapegoats of the weak , or of helpless political , religious , or racial minorities and those who differed , who would not conform and who resisted tyranny . The instruments of such governments were , in the main , two . Conduct , innocent when engaged in , was subsequently made by fiat criminally punishable without legislation . And a liberty - loving people won the principle that criminal punishments could not be inflicted save for that which proper legislative action had already , by " the law of the land , " forbidden when done . But even more was needed . From the popular hatred and abhorrence of illegal confinement , torture and extortion of confessions of violations of the " law of the land " evolved the fundamental idea that no man 's life , liberty or property be forfeited as criminal punishment for violation of that law until there had been a charge fairly made and fairly tried in a public [ p237 ] tribunal free of prejudice , passion , excitement , and tyrannical power . Thus , as assurance against ' ancient evils , our country , in order to preserve " the blessings of liberty , " wrote into its basic law the requirement , among others , that the forfeiture of the lives , liberties or property of people accused of crime can only follow if procedural safeguards of due process have been obeyed . [ n10 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
The determination to preserve an accused 's right to procedural due process sprang in large part from knowledge of the historical truth that the rights and liberties of people accused of crime could not be safely entrusted to secret inquisitorial processes . The testimony of centuries , in governments of varying kinds over populations of different races and beliefs , stood as proof that physical and mental torture and coercion had brought about the tragically unjust sacrifices of some who were the noblest and most useful of their generations . The rack , the thumbscrew , the wheel , solitary confinement , protracted questioning and cross questioning , and other ingenious forms of entrapment of the helpless or unpopular had left their wake of mutilated bodies and shattered minds along the way to the cross , the guillotine , the stake and [ p238 ] the hangman 's noose . And they who have suffered most from secret and dictatorial proceedings have almost always been the poor , the ignorant , the numerically weak , the friendless , and the powerless . [ n11 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
This requirement -- of conforming to fundamental standards of procedure in criminal trials -- was made operative against the States by the Fourteenth Amendment . Where one of several accused had limped into the trial court as a result of admitted physical mistreatment inflicted to obtain confessions upon which a jury had returned a verdict of guilty of murder , this Court recently declared , Brown v. Mississippi , that	@@empty@@	unmatched
Here , the record develops a sharp conflict upon the issue of physical violence and mistreatment , but shows , without conflict , the dragnet methods of arrest on suspicion without warrant , and the protracted questioning and cross - questioning of these ignorant young colored tenant farmers by state officers and other white citizens , in a fourth floor jail room , where , as prisoners , they were without friends , advisers or counselors , and under circumstances calculated to break the strongest nerves and [ p239 ] the stoutest resistance . Just as our decision in Brown v. Mississippi was based upon the fact that the confessions were the result of compulsion , so , in the present case , the admitted practices were such as to justify the statement that " The undisputed facts showed that compulsion was applied . " [ n13 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
For five days , petitioners were subjected to interrogations culminating in Saturday 's ( May 20th ) all - night examination . Over a period of five days , they steadily refused to confess , and disclaimed any guilt . The very circumstances surrounding their confinement and their questioning , without an formal charges having been brought , were such as to fill petitioners with terror and frightful misgivings . [ n14 ] Some were practical strangers in [ p240 ] the community ; three were arrested in a one - room farm tenant house which was their home ; the haunting fear of mob violence was around them in an atmosphere charged with excitement and public indignation . From virtually the moment of their arrest until their eventual confessions , they never knew just when any one would be called back to the fourth floor room , and there , surrounded by his accusers and others , interrogated by men who held their very lives -- so far as these ignorant petitioners could know -- in the balance . The rejection of petitioner Woodward 's first " confession , " given in the early hours of Sunday morning because it was found wanting , demonstrates the relentless tenacity which " broke " petitioners ' will and rendered them helpless to resist their accusers further . To permit human lives to be forfeited upon confessions thus obtained would make of the constitutional requirement of due process of law a meaningless symbol .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We are not impressed by the argument that law enforcement methods such as those under review are necessary to uphold our laws . [ n15 ] The Constitution proscribes [ p241 ] such lawless means irrespective of the end . And this argument flouts the basic principle that all people must stand on an equality before the bar of justice in every American court . Today , as in ages past , we are not without tragic proof that the exalted power of some governments to punish manufactured crime dictatorially is the handmaid of tyranny . Under our constitutional system , courts stand against any winds that blow as havens of refuge for those who might otherwise suffer because they are helpless , weak , outnumbered , or because they are nonconforming victims of prejudice and public excitement . Due process of law , preserved for all by our Constitution , commands that no such practice as that disclosed by this record shall send any accused to his death . No higher duty , no more solemn responsibility , rests upon this Court than that of translating into living law and maintaining this constitutional shield deliberately planned and inscribed for the benefit of every human being subject to our Constitution -- of whatever race , creed or persuasion .

Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The respondent , Torao Takahashi , born in Japan , came to this country and became a resident of California in 1907 . Federal laws , based on distinctions of ' color and race , ' Hidemitsu Toyota v. United States , 268 U.S. 402 , 411 , 412 , 45 S.Ct . 563 , 565 , 566 , 69 L.Ed . 1016 , have permitted Japanese and certain other nonwhite racial groups to enter and reside in the country , but have made them ineligible for United States citizenship . 1 The question presented is whether California can , consistently with the Federal Constitution and laws passed pursuant to it , use this federally created racial ineligibility for citizenship as a basis for barring Takahashi from earning his living as a commercial fisherman in the ocean waters off the coast of California .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Prior to 1943 California issued commercial fishing licenses to all qualified persons without regard to alienage or ineligibility to citizenship . From 1915 to 1942 Takahashi , under annual commercial fishing licenses issued by the State , fished in ocean waters off the California coast , apparently both within and without the three - mile coastal belt , and brought his fresh fish ashore for sale . In 1942 , while this country was at war with Japan , Takahashi and other California residents of Japanese ancestry were evacuated from the State under military orders . See Korematsu v. United States , 323 U.S. 214 , 65 S.Ct . 193 , 89 L.Ed . 194 . In 1943 , during the period of war and evacuation , an amendment to the California Fish and Game Code was adopted prohibiting issuance of a license to any ' alien Japanese . ' Cal . Stats . 1943 , ch . 1100 . In 1945 , the state code was again amended by striking the 1943 provision for fear that it might be ' declared unconstitutional ' because directed only ' against alien Japanese ' ; 2 the new amendment banned issuance of licenses to any ' person ineligible to citizenship , ' which classification included Japanese . Cal . Stats . 1945 , ch . 181 . 3 Because of this state provision barring issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons ineligible for citizenship underf ederal law , Takahashi , who met all other state requirements , was denied a license by the California Fish and Game Commission upon his return to California in 1945 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Takahashi brought this action for mandamus in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County , California , to compel the Commission to issue a license to him . That court granted the petition for mandamus . It held that lawful alien inhabitants of California , despite their ineligibility to citizenship , were entitled to engage in the vocation of commercial fishing on the high seas beyond the three - mile belt on the same terms as other lawful state inhabitants , and that the California code provision denying them this right violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . The State Supreme Court , three judges dissenting , reversed , holding that California had a proprietary interest in fish in the ocean waters within 3 miles of the shore , and that this interest justified the State in barring all aliens in general and aliens ineligible to citizenship in particular from catching fish within or without the threemile coastal belt and bringing them to California for commercial purposes . 30 Cal.2d 719 , 185 P.2d 805 , 808 . 4 To review this question of importance in the fields of federal - state relationships and of constitutionally protected individual equality and liberty , we granted certiorari .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We may well begin our consideration of the principles to be applied in this case by a summary of this Court 's holding in Truax v. Raich , 239 U.S. 33 , 36 S.Ct . 7 , 9 , 60 L.Ed . 131 , L.R.A. 1916D , 545 , Ann . Cas . 1917B , 283 , not deemed controlling by the majority of the California Supreme Court , but regarded by the dissenters as requiring the invalidation of the California law . That case involved an attack upon an Arizona law which required all Arizona employers of more than five workers to hire not less than eighty ( 80 ) per cent qualified electors or native - born citizens of the United States . Raich , an alien who worked as a cook in a restaurant which had more than five employees , was about to lose his job solely because of the state law 's coercive effect on the restaurant owner . This Court , in upholding Raich 's contention that the Arizona law was invalid , declared that Raich , having been lawfully admitted into the country under federal law , had a federal privilege to enter and abide in ' any state in the Union ' and thereafter under the Fourteenth Amendment to enjoy the equal protection of the laws of the state in which he abided ; that this privilege to enter in and abide in any state carried with it the ' right to work for a living in the common occupations of the community , ' a denial of which right would make of the Amendment ' a barren form of words . ' In answer to a contention that Arizona 's restriction upon the employment of aliens was ' reasonable ' and therefore permissible , this Court declared :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' It must also be said that reasonable classification implies action consistent with the legitimate interests of the state , and it will not be disputed that these can not be so broadly conceived as to bring them into hostility to exclusive Federal power . The authority to control immigrationto admit or exclude aliensis vested solely in the Federal government . Fong Yue Ting v. United States , 149 U.S. 698 , 713 , 13 S.Ct . 1016 , 1022 , 37 L.Ed . 905 , 913 . The assertion of an authority to deny to aliens the opportunity of earning a livelihood when lawfully admitted to the state would be tantamount to the assertion of the right to deny them entrance and abode , for in ordinary cases they can not live where they can not work . And , if such a policy were permissible , the practical result would be that those lawfully admitted to the country under the authority of the acts of Congress , instead of enjoying in a substantial sense and in their full scope the privileges conferred by the admission , would be seggregated in such of the states as chose to offer hospitality . ' Truax v. Raich , supra , 239 U.S. at page 42 , 36 S.Ct . at page 11 , 60 L.Ed . 131 , L.R.A. 1916D , 545 , Ann . Cas . 1917B , 283 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Had the Truax decision said nothing further than what is quoted above , its reasoning , if followed , would seem to require invalidation of this California code provision barring aliens from the occupation of fishing as inconsistent with federal law , which is constitutionally declared to be ' the supreme Law of the Land . ' Const . art . 6 , cl . 2 . However , the Court there went on to note that it had on occasion sustained state legislation that did not apply alike to citizens and non - citizens , the ground for the distinction being that such laws were necessary to protect special interests either of the state or of its citizens as such . The Truax opinion pointed out that the Arizona law , aimed as it was against employment of aliens in all vocations , failed to show a ' special public interest with respect to any particular business * * * that could possibly be deemed to support the enactment . ' The Court noted that it had previously upheld various state laws which resricted the privilege of planting oysters in the tidewater rivers of a state to cii zens of that state , and which denied to aliens within a state the privilege of possessing a rifle and of shooting game within that state ; it also referred to decisions recognizing a state 's broad powers , in the absence of overriding treaties , to restrict the devolution of real property to non - aliens . 5	@@empty@@	unmatched
California now urges , and the State Supreme Court held , that the California fishing provision here challenged falls within the rationale of the ' special public interest ' cases distinguished in the Truax opinion , and thus that the state 's ban upon commercial fishing by aliens ineligible to citizenship is valid . The contention is this : California owns the fish within three miles of its coast as a trustee for all California citizens as distinguished from its noncitizen inhabitants ; as such trustee - owner , it has complete power to bar any or all aliens from fishing in the three - mile belt as a means of conserving the supply of fish ; since migratory fish caught while swimming in the three - mile belt are indistinguishable from those caught while swimming in the adjacent high seas , the State , in order to enforce its three - mile control , can also regulate the catching and delivery to its coast of fish caught beyond the three mile belt under this Court 's decision in Bayside Fish Co. v. Gentry , 297 U.S. 422 , 56 S.Ct . 513 , 80 L.Ed . 772 . Its law denying fishing licenses to aliens ineligible for citizenship , so the state 's contention goes , tends to reduce the number of commercial fishermen and therefore is a proper fish conservation measure ; in the exercise of its power to decide what groups will be denied licenses , the State has a right if not a duty , to bar first of all aliens , who have no community interest in the fish owned by the State . Finally , the legislature 's denial of licenses to those aliens who are ' ineligible to citizenship ' is defended as a reasonable classification , on the ground that California has simply followed the Federal Government 's lead in adopting that classification from the naturalization laws .	@@empty@@	unmatched
First . The state 's contention that its law was passed solely as a fish conservation measure is vigorously denied . The petitioner argues that it was the outgrowth of racial antagonism directed solely against the Japanese , and that for this reason alone it can not stand . See Korematsu v. United States , supra , 323 U.S. at page 216 , 65 S.Ct . at page 194 , 89 L.Ed . 194 ; Kotch v. Board of River Pilot Com'rs , 330 U.S. 552 , 556 , 67 S.Ct . 910 , 912 , 91 L.Ed . 1093 ; Yick Wo v. Hopkins , 118 U.S. 356 , 6 S.Ct . 1064 , 30 L.Ed . 220 ; In re Ah Chong , C.C. , 2 F. 733 , 737 . We find it unnecessary to resolve this controversy concerning the motives that prompted enactment of the legislation . Accordingly , for purposes of our decision we may assume that the code provision was passed to conserve fish in the California coastal waters , or to protect California citizens engaged in commercial fishing from competition by Japanese aliens , or for both reasons .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Second . It does not follow , as California seems to argue that because the United States regulates immigration and naturalization in part on the basis of race and color classifications , a state can adopt one or more of the same classifications to prevent lawfully admitted aliens within its borders from earning a living in the same way that other state inhabitants earn their living . The Federal Government has broad constitutional powers in determining what aliens shall be admitted to the United States , the period they may remain , regulation of their conduct before naturalization , and the terms and conditions of their naturalization . See Hines v. Davidowitz , 312 U.S. 52 , 66 , 61 S.Ct . 399 , 403 , 85 L.Ed . 581 . Under the Constitution the states are grante no such powers ; they can neither add to nor take from the conditions lawfully imposed by Congress upon admission , naturalization and residence of aliens in the United States or the several states . State laws which impose discriminatory burdens upon the entrance or residence of aliens lawfully within the United States conflict with this constitutionally derived federal power to regulate immigration , and have accordingly been held invalid . 6 Moreover , Congress , in the enactment of a comprehensive legislative plan for the nation - wide control and regulation of immigration and naturalization , has broadly provided :	@@empty@@	unmatched
' All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts , to sue , be parties , give evidence , and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens , and shall be subject to like punishment , pains , penalties , taxes , licenses , and exactions of every kind , and to no other .

The protection of this section has been held to extend to aliens as well as to citizens . 7 Consequently the section and the Fourteenth Amendment on which it rests in part protect ' all persons ' against state legislation bearing unequally upon them either because of alienage or color . See Hurd v. Hodge , 334 U.S. 24 , 68 S.Ct . 847 . The Fourteenth Amendment and the laws adopted under its authority thus embody a general policy that all persons lawfully in this country shall abide ' in any state ' on an equality of legal privileges with all citizens under non - discriminatory laws .	@@empty@@	unmatched
All of the foregoing emphasizes the tenuousness of the state 's claim that it has power to single out and ban its lawful alien inhabitants , and particularly certain racial and color groups within this class of inhabitants , from following a vocation simply because Congress has put some such groups in special classifications in exercise of its broad and wholly distinguishable powers over immigration and naturalization . The state 's law here can not be supported in the employment of this legislative authority because of policies adopted by Congress in the exercise of its power to treat separately and differently with aliens from countries composed of peoples of many diverse cultures , races , and colors . For these reasons the power of a state to apply its laws exclusively to its alien inhabitants as a class is confined within narrow limits .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Third . We are unable to find that the ' special public interest ' on which California relies provides support for this state ban on Takahashi 's commercial fishing . As before pointed out , California 's claim of ' special public interest ' is that its citizens are the collective owners of fish swimming in the three - mile belt . It is true that this Court did long ago say that the citizens of a state collectively own ' the tide - waters * * * and the fish in them , so far as they are capable of ownership while running . ' McCready v. Virginia , 94 U.S. 391 , 394 , 24 L.Ed . 248 . Cf . United States v. California , 332 U.S. 19 , 38 , 67 S.Ct . 1658 ; Toomer v. Witsell , 334 U.S. 385 , 68 S.Ct . 1156 . The McCready case upheld a Virginia law which prohibited citizens of other states from planting oysters in a Virginia tidewater river . Though the McCready case has been often distinguished , its rationale has been relied on in other cases , including Geer v. Connecticut , 161 U.S. 519 , 16 S.Ct . 600 , 40 L.Ed . 793 . That decision , where only te commerce clause was involved , sustained a state law , that , in order to restrict the use of game to the people of the state , prohibited the out - of - state transportation of game killed within the state . On the other hand , where Louisiana laws declared that the state owned all shrimp within the waters of the state , but permitted ultimate sale and shipment of shrimp for consumption outside that state 's boundaries , Louisiana was denied power under the commerce clause to require the local processing of shrimp taken from Louisiana marshes as a prerequisite to out - of - state transportation . Foster - Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel , 278 U.S. 1 , 49 S.Ct . 1 , 73 L.Ed . 147 . In the absence of overriding federal treaties , this Court sustained a state law barring aliens from hunting wild game in the interest of conserving game for citizens of the state against due process and equal protection challenges . Patsone v. Pennsylvania , 232 U.S. 138 , 34 S.Ct . 281 , 58 L.Ed . 539 . Later , however , the Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 , 40 Stat . 755 , 16 U.S.C.A. § 703 , was sustained as within federal power despite the claim of Missouri of ownership of birds within its boundaries based on prior statements as to state ownership of game and fish in the Geer case . Missouri v. Holland , 252 U.S. 416 , 40 S.Ct . 382 , 64 L.Ed . 641 , 11 A.L.R. 984 . The Court was of opinion that ' To put the claim of the State upon title is to lean upon a slender reed . ' 252 U.S. at page 434 , 40 S.Ct . at page 384 , 64 L.Ed . 641 , 11 A.L.R. 984 . We think that same statement is equally applicable here . To whatever extent the fish in the three - mile belt off California may be ' capable of ownership ' by California , we think that ' ownership ' is inadequate to justify California in excluding any or all aliens who are lawful residents of the State from making a living by fishing in the ocean off its shores while permitting all others to do so .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This leaves for consideration the argument that this law should be upheld on authority of those cases which have sustained state laws barring aliens ineligible to citizenship from land ownership . 8 Assuming the continued validity of those cases , 9 we think they could not in any event be controlling here . They rested solely upon the power of states to control the devolution and ownership of land within their borders , a power long exercised and supported on reasons peculiar to real property . They can not be extended to cover this case .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Mr. Justice MURPHY , with whom Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE agrees , concurring .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The opinion of the Court , in which I join , adequately expresses my views as to all but one important aspect of this case . That aspect relates to the fact that § 990 of the California Fish and Game Code , barring those ineligible to citizenship from securing commercial fishing licenses , is the direct outgrowth of antagonism toward persons of Japanese ancestry . Even the most cursory examination of the background of the statute demonstrates that it was designed solely to discriminate against such persons in a manner inconsistent with the concept of equal protection of the laws . Legislation of that type is not entitled to wear the cloak of constitutionality .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The statute in question is but one more manifestation of the anti - Japanese fever which has been evident in California in varying degrees since the turn of the century . See concurring opinion in Oyama v. California , 332 U.S. 633 , 650 , 68 S.Ct . 269 , 277 and dissenting opinion in Korematsu v. United States , 323 U.S. 214 , 233 , 65 S.Ct . 193 , 201 , 89 L.Ed . 194 . That fever , of course , is trc eable to the refusal or the inability of certain groups to adjust themselves economically and socially relative to residents of Japanese ancestry . For some years prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , these protagonists of intolerance had been leveling unfounded accusations and innuendoes against Japanese fishing crews operating off the coast of California . These fishermen numbered about a thousand and most of them had long resided in that state . It was claimed that they were engaged not only in fishing but in espionage and other illicit activities on behalf of the Japanese Government . As war with Japan approached and finally became a reality , these charges were repeated with increasing vigor . Yet full investigations by appropriate authorities failed to reveal any competent supporting evidence ; not even one Japanese fisherman was arrested for alleged espionage . Such baseless accusations can only be viewed as an integral part of the long campaign to undermine the reputation of persons of Japanese background and to discourage their residence in California . See McWilliams , Prejudice ( 1944 ) , ch . VII .	@@empty@@	unmatched
More specifically , these accusations were used to secure the passage of discriminatory fishing legislation . But such legislation was not immediately forthcoming . The continued presence in California of the Japanese fishermen without the occurrence of any untoward incidents on their part served for a time as adequate and living refutation of the propaganda . Then came the evacuation of all persons of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast . See Korematsu v. United States , supra . Once evacuation was achieved , an intensive campaign was begun to prevent the return to California of the evacuees . All of the old charges , including the ones relating to the fishermen , were refurbished and augmented . This time the Japanese were absent and were unable to provide effective opposition . The winds of racial animosity blew unabated .	@@empty@@	unmatched
During the height of this racial storm in 1943 , numerous anti - Japanese bills were considered by the California legislators . Several amendments to the Alien Land Law were enacted . And § 990 of the Fish and Game Code was altered to provide that ' A commercial fishing license may be issued to any person other than an alien Japanese . ' No pretense was made that this alteration was in the interests of conservation . It was made at a time when all alien Japanese were excluded from California , with no immediate return indicated ; thus the banning of fishing licenses for them could have no early effect upon the conservation of fish . Moreover , the period during which this amendment was passed was one in which both federal and state authorities were doing their utmost to encourage greater food production for wartime purposes . The main desire at this time was to increase rather than to decrease the catch of fish . Certainly the contemporaneous bulletins and reports of the Bureau of Marine Fisheries of California did not indicate the existence of any conservation problem due to an excess number of fishermen . See Thirty - Eighth Biennial Report ( July 1 , 1944 ) , pp . 33 - 36 ; Fish Bulletin No . 58 , for the year 1940 ; Fish Bulletin No . 59 , for the years 1941 and 1942 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
These circumstances only confirm the obvious fact that the 1943 amendment to § 990 was intended to discourage the return to California of Japanese aliens . By taking away their commercial fishing rights , the lives of those aliens who plied the fisherman 's trade would be made more difficult and unremunerative . And the non - Japanese fishermen would thereby be free from the competition afforded by these aliens . The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment , however , does not permit a state to discriminate against resident aliens in such a fashion , whether the purpose be to give effect to racial animosity or to protect the competitive interests of other residents .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The 1945 amendment to § 900 which is now before us stands in no better position than the 1943 amendment . This later alteratio eliminated the reference to ' alien Japanese ' and substituted therefor ' a person ineligible to citizenship . ' Adoption of this change also occurred during a period when anti - Japanese agitation in California had reached one of its periodic peaks . The announcement of the end of the Japanese exclusion orders , plus this Court 's decision in Ex parte Endo , 323 U.S. 283 , 65 S.Ct . 208 , 89 L.Ed . 243 , made the return to California of many of the evacuees a reasonable certainty . The prejudices , the antagonisms and the hatreds were once again aroused , punctuated this time by numerous acts of violence against the returning Japanese Americans . Another wave of anti - Japanese proposals marked the 1945 legislative session . It was in this setting that the amendment to § 990 was proposed and enacted in 1945 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is of interest and significance that the amendment in question was proposed by a legislative committee devoted to Japanese resettlement problems , not by a committee concerned with the conservation of fish . The Senate Fact - Finding Committee on Japanese Resettlement issued a report on May 1 , 1945 . This report dealt with such matters as the Alien Land Law , the Japanese language schools , dual citizenship and the Tule Lake riot . And under the heading ' Japanese Fishing Boats ' ( pp . 5 - 6 ) appeared this explanation of the proposed amendment to § 900 : ' The committee gave little consideration to the problems of the use of fishing vessels on our coast owned and operated by Japanese , since this matter seems to have previously been covered by legislation . The committee , however , feels that there is danger of the present statute being declared unconstitutional , on the grounds of discrimination , since it is directed against alien Japanese . It is believed that this legal question can probably be eliminated by an amendment which has been proposed to the bill which would make it apply to any alien who is ineligible to citizenship . The committee has introduced Senate Bill 413 to make this change in the statute . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
Not a word was said in this reort regarding the need for the conservation of fish or the necessity of limiting the number of fishermen . The obvious thought behind the amendment was to attempt to legalize the discrimination against Japanese alien fishermen by dropping the specific reference to them .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The proposed revision was adopted . The trial court below correctly described the situation as follows : ' As it was commonly known to the legislators of 1945 that Japanese were the only aliens ineligible to citizenship who engaged in commercial fishing in ocean waters bordering on California , and as the Court must take judicial notice of the same fact , it becomes manifest that in enacting the present version of Section 990 , the Legislature intended thereby to eliminate alien Japanese from those entitled to a commercial fishing license by means of description rather than by name . To all intents and purposes and in effect the provision in the 1943 and 1945 amendments are the same , the thin veil used to conceal a purpose being too transparent . Under each and both , alien Japanese are denied a right to a license to catch fish on the high seas for profit , and to bring them to shore for the purpose of selling the same in a fresh state * * * this discrimination constitutes an unequal exaction and a greater burden upon the persons of the class named than that imposed upon others in the same calling and under the same conditions , and amounts to prohibition . This discrimination , patently hostile , is not based upon a reasonable ground of classification and , to that extent , the section is in violation of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States , * * * . '	@@empty@@	unmatched
We should not blink at the fact that § 990 , as now written , is a discriminatory piece of legislation having no relation whatever to any constitutionally cognizable interest of California . It was drawn against a background of racial and economic tension . It is directed in spirit and in effect soley against aliens of Japanese birth . It denies them commercial fishing rights not because they threaten the success of any conservation program , not because their fishing activities constitute a clear and present danger to the welfare of California or of the nation , but only because they are of Japanese stock , a stock which has had the misfortune to arouse antagonism among certain powerful interests . We need but unbutton he seemingly innocent words of § 990 to discover beneath them the very negation of all the ideals of the equal protection clause . No more is necessary to warrant a reversal of the judgment below .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Mr. Justice REED , dissenting .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The reasons which lead me to conclude that the judgment of the Supreme Court of California should be affirmed may be briefly stated . As fishing rights have been treated traditionally as a natural resource , in the absence of federal regulation , California as a sovereign state has power to regulate the taking and handling of fish in the waters bordering its shores . 1 It is , I think , one of the natural resources of the state that may be preserved from exploitation by aliens . 2 The ground for this power in the absence of any exercise of federal authority is California 's authority over its fisheries .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The right to fish is analogous to the right to own land , a privilege which a state may deny to aliens as to land within its borders . Terrace v. Thompson , 263 U.S. 197 , 44 S.Ct . 15 , 68 L.Ed . 255 . 3 It is closely akin to the right to hunt , a privilege from which a state may bar aliens , if reasonably deemed advantageous to its citizens . 4 A state 's power has even been held to extend to the exclusion of aliens from the operation of pool and billiard halls when a city deemed them not as well qualified as citizens for the conduct of a business thought to have harmful tendencies . Clarke v. Deckebach , 274 U.S. 392 , 47 S.Ct . 630 , 71 L.Ed . 1115 . 5	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Federal Government has not pursued a policy of equal treatment of aliens and citizens . Citizens have rights superior to those of aliens in the ownership of land and in exploiting natural resources . 6 Perhaps Congress as a matter of immigration policy may require that states open every door of opportunity in America to all resident aliens , but until Congress so determines as to fisheries , I do not feel that the judicial arm of the Government should require the states to admit all aliens to this privilege .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Certainly Truax v. Raich , 239 U.S. 33 , 36 S.Ct . 7 , 60 L.Ed . 131 , L.R.A. 1916D , 545 , Ann . Cas . 1917B , 283 , upon which the majority opinion appears to rely in holding that the California statute denies equal protection in attempting to classify aliens by putting restrictions on their right to land fish , is not an authority for such a decision . The power of a state to discriminate against aliens on public works and the exploitation of natural resources was recognized in that case . 7 And , at the very time that it was under consideration , this Court also had before it Heim v. McCall , 239 U.S. 175 , 36 S.Ct . 78 , 60 L.Ed . 206 , Ann . Cas . 1917B , 287 . 8 In that case , Heim attacked the constitutionality of a New York statute which provided that ' In the construction of public works by the state or a municipality , or by persons contracting with the state or such municipality , only citizens of the United States shall be employed ; and in all cases where laborers are employed on any such public works , preference shall be given citizens of the state of New York . ' 9 A unanimous court held that the statute , which was attacked on the ground that it denied aliens their rights under the privileges and immunities , due process , and equal protection clauses of the Constitution , was a constitutional exercise of state power as applied to the construction of New York City subways by private contractors . 10 The Constitution that permits the bar of aliens from public works surely must permit their bar from state fishing rights . A state has power to exclude from enjoyment of its natural resources those who are unwilling or unable to become citizens .	@@empty@@	unmatched
If aliens , as I think they can , may be excluded by a state from fishing privileges , I see no reason why the classification established by California excluding only aliens ineligible to citizenship is prohibited by the Constitution . Terrace v. Thompson , 263 U.S. 197 , 220 , 44 S.Ct . 15 , 19 , 68 L.Ed . 255 .

The Anti - Trust Act of 1890 was enacted in the light of the then existing practical conception of the law against restraint of trade , and the intent of Congress was not to restrain the right to make and enforce contracts , whether resulting from combinations or otherwise , which do not unduly restrain interstate or foreign commerce , but to protect that commerce from contracts or combinations by methods , whether old or new , which would constitute an interference with , or an undue restraint upon , it .	@@empty@@	unmatched

The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and 33 other corporations , John D. Rockefeller , William Rockefeller , and five other individual defendants prosecute this appeal to reverse a decree of the court below . Such decree was entered upon a bill filed by the United States under authority of § 4 of the act of July 2 , 1890 , c. 647 , p. 209 , known as the Anti - Trust Act , and had for its object the enforcement of the provisions of that act . The record is inordinately voluminous , consisting of twenty - three volumes of printed matter , aggregating about twelve thousand pages , containing a vast amount of confusing and conflicting testimony [ p31 ] relating to innumerable , complex and varied business transactions , extending over a period of nearly forty years . In an effort to pave the way to reach the subjects which we are called upon to consider , we propose at the outset , following the order of the bill , to give the merest possible outline of its contents , to summarize the answer , to indicate the course of the trial , and point out briefly the decision below rendered .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The bill and exhibits , covering one hundred and seventy pages of the printed record , was filed on November 15 , 1906 . Corporations known as Standard Oil Company of New Jersey , Standard Oil Company of California , Standard Oil Company of Indiana , Standard Oil Company of Iowa , Standard Oil Company of Kansas , Standard Oil Company of Kentucky , Standard Oil Company of Nebraska , Standard Oil Company of New York , Standard Oil Company of Ohio , and sixty - two other corporations and partnerships , as also seven individuals were named as defendants . The bill was divided into thirty numbered sections , and sought relief upon the theory that the various defendants were engaged in conspiring	@@empty@@	unmatched
The conspiracy was alleged to have been formed in or about the year 1870 by three of the individual defendants , viz : John D. Rockefeller , William Rockefeller , and Henry M. Flagler . The detailed averments concerning the alleged conspiracy were arranged with reference to three periods , the first from 1870 to 1882 , the second from 1882 to 1899 , and the third from 1899 to the time of the filing of the bill .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The general charge concerning the period from 1870 to 1882 was as follows : [ p32 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
To establish this charge , it was averred that John D. and William Rockefeller and several other named individuals , who , prior to 1870 , composed three separate partnerships engaged in the business of refining crude oil and shipping its products in interstate commerce , organized in the year 1870 a corporation known as the Standard Oil Company of Ohio and transferred to that company the business of the said partnerships , the members thereof becoming , in proportion to their prior ownership , stockholders in the corporation . It was averred that the other individual defendants soon afterwards became participants in the illegal combination and either transferred property to the corporation or to individuals to be held for the benefit of all parties in interest in proportion to their respective interests in the combination ; that is , in proportion to their stock ownership in the Standard Oil Company of Ohio . By the means thus stated , it was charged that , by the year 1872 , the combination had acquired substantially all but three or four of the thirty - five or forty oil refineries located in Cleveland , Ohio . By reason of the power thus obtained and in further execution of the intent and purpose to restrain trade and to monopolize the commerce , interstate as well as intrastate , in petroleum and its products , the bill alleged that the combination and its members [ p33 ] obtained large preferential rates and rebates in many and devious ways over their competitors from various railroad companies , and that , by means of the advantage thus obtained , many , if not virtually all , competitors were forced either to become members of the combination or were driven out of business , and thus , it was alleged , during the period in question , the following results were brought about : a. that the combination , in addition to the refineries in Cleveland which it had acquired as previously stated , and which it had either dismantled to limit production or continued to operate , also from time to time acquired a large number of refineries of crude petroleum , situated in New York , Pennsylvania , Ohio and elsewhere . The properties thus acquired , like those previously obtained , although belonging to and being held for the benefit of the combination , were ostensibly divergently controlled , some of them being put in the name of the Standard Oil Company of Ohio , some in the name of corporations or limited partnerships affiliated therewith , or some being left in the name of the original owners , who had become stockholders in the Standard Oil Company of Ohio , and thus members of the alleged illegal combination . b. That the combination had obtained control of the pipelines available for transporting oil from the oil fields to the refineries in Cleveland , Pittsburgh , Titusville , Philadelphia , New York and New Jersey . c. That the combination during the period named had obtained a complete mastery over the oil industry , controlling 90 percent of the business of producing , shipping , refining and selling petroleum and its products , and thus was able to fix the price of crude and refined petroleum and to restrain and monopolize all interstate commerce in those products .	@@empty@@	unmatched

By its terms , the stock of forty corporations , including the Standard Oil Company of Ohio , and a large quantity of various properties which had been previously acquired by the alleged combination and which was held in diverse forms , as we have previously indicated , for the benefit of the members of the combination , was vested in the trustees and their successors , " to be held for all parties in interest jointly . " In the body of the trust agreement was contained a list of the various individuals and corporations and limited partnerships whose stockholders and members , or a portion thereof , became parties to the agreement . This list is in the margin . [ n1 ] [ p35 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
The agreement made provision for the method of controlling and managing the property by the trustees , for the formation of additional manufacturing , etc . , corporations [ p36 ] in various States , and the trust , unless terminated by a mode specified , was to continue " during the lives of the survivors and survivor of the trustees named in the agreement and for twenty - one years thereafter . " The agreement provided for the issue of Standard Oil Trust certificates to represent the interest arising under the trust in the properties affected by the trust , which , of course , in view of the provisions of the agreement and the subject to which it related , caused the interest in the certificates to be coincident with and the exact representative of the interest in the combination , that is , in the Standard Oil Company of Ohio . Soon afterwards , it was alleged , the trustees organized the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and the Standard Oil Company of New York , the former having a capital stock of $ 3,000,000 and the latter a capital stock of $ 5,000,000 , subsequently increased to $ 10,000,000 and $ 15,000,000 , respectively .

The bill charged that , during the second period , quo warranto proceedings were commenced against the Standard Oil Company of Ohio , which resulted in the entry by the Supreme Court of Ohio , on March 2 , 1892 , of a decree [ p39 ] adjudging the trust agreement to be void , not only because the Standard Oil Company of Ohio was a party to the same , but also because the agreement , in and of itself , [ p40 ] was in restraint of trade and amounted to the creation of an unlawful monopoly . It was alleged that shortly after this decision , seemingly for the purpose of complying therewith , voluntary proceedings were had apparently to dissolve the trust , but that these proceedings were a subterfuge and a sham , because they simply amounted to a transfer of the stock held by the trust in 64 of the companies which it controlled to some of the remaining 20 companies , it having controlled before the decree 84 in all , thereby , while seemingly in part giving up its dominion , yet in reality preserving the same by means of the control of the companies as to which it had retained complete authority . It was charged that especially was this the case as the stock in the companies selected for transfer was virtually owned by the nine trustees or the members of their immediate families or associates . The bill further alleged that , in 1897 , the Attorney - General of Ohio instituted contempt proceedings in the quo warranto case based upon the claim that the trust had not been dissolved as required by the decree in that case . About the same time also , proceedings in quo warranto were commenced to forfeit the charter of a pipeline known as the Buckeye Pipe Line Company , an [ p41 ] Ohio corporation , whose stock , it was alleged , was owned by the members of the combination , on the ground of its connection with the trust which had been held to be illegal .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The result of these proceedings , the bill charged , caused a resort to the alleged wrongful acts asserted to have been committed during the third period , as follows :	@@empty@@	unmatched
It was alleged that , in or about the month of January , 1899 , the individual defendants caused the charter of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey to be amended	@@empty@@	unmatched
The capital stock of the company -- which , since March 19 , 1892 , had been $ 10,000,000 -- was increased to $ 110,000,000 , and the individual defendants , as theretofore , continued to be a majority of the board of directors .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Without going into detail , it suffices to say that it was alleged in the bill that , shortly after these proceedings , the trust came to an end , the stock of the various corporations which had been controlled by it being transferred by its holders to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey , which corporation issued therefor certificates of its common stock to the amount of $ 97,250,000 . The bill contained allegations referring to the development of new oil fields , for example , in California , southeastern Kansas , northern Indian Territory , and northern Oklahoma , and made reference to the building or otherwise acquiring by the combination of refineries and pipelines in the new fields for the purpose of restraining and monopolizing the interstate trade in petroleum and its products .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Reiterating in substance the averments that both the Standard Oil Trust from 1882 to 1899 and the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey since 1899 had monopolized and restrained interstate commerce in petroleum and its products , the bill at great length additionally set forth various means by which , during the second and third periods , in addition to the effect occasioned by the combination of alleged previously independent concerns , the monopoly and restraint complained of was continued . Without attempting to follow the elaborate averments on these subjects spread over fifty - seven pages of the printed record , it suffices to say that such averments may properly be grouped under the following heads : rebates , preferences and other discriminatory practises in favor of the combination by railroad companies ; restraint and monopolization by control of pipelines , and unfair practises against competing [ p43 ] pipelines ; contracts with competitors in restraint of trade ; unfair methods of competition , such as local price - cutting at the points where necessary to suppress competition ; espionage of the business of competitors , the operation of bogus independent companies , and payment of rebates on oil , with the like intent ; the division of the United States into districts and the limiting of the operations of the various subsidiary corporations as to such districts so that competition in the sale of petroleum products between such corporations had been entirely eliminated and destroyed , and , finally , reference was made to what was alleged to be the " enormous and unreasonable profits " earned by the Standard Oil Trust and the Standard Oil Company as a result of the alleged monopoly , which presumably was averred as a means of reflexly inferring the scope and power acquired by the alleged combination .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Coming to the prayer of the bill , it suffices to say that , in general terms , the substantial relief asked was , first , that the combination in restraint of interstate trade and commerce and which had monopolized the same , as alleged in the bill , be found to have existence , and that the parties thereto be perpetually enjoined from doing any further act to give effect to it ; second , that the transfer of the stocks of the various corporations to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey , as alleged in the bill , be held to be in violation of the first and second sections of the Antitrust Act , and that the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey be enjoined and restrained from in any manner continuing to exert control over the subsidiary corporations by means of ownership of said stock or otherwise ; third , that specific relief by injunction be awarded against further violation of the statute by any of the acts specifically complained of in the bill . There was also a prayer for general relief .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Of the numerous defendants named in the bill , the Waters - Pierce Oil Company was the only resident of the [ p44 ] district in which the suit was commenced and the only defendant served with process therein . Contemporaneous with the filing of the bill , the court made an order , under § 5 of the Anti - Trust Act , for the service of process upon all the other defendants , wherever they could be found . Thereafter , the various defendants unsuccessfully moved to vacate the order for service on nonresident defendants or filed pleas to the jurisdiction . Joint exceptions were likewise unsuccessfully filed , upon the ground of impertinence , to many of the averments of the bill of complaint , particularly those which related to acts alleged to have been done by the combination prior to the passage of the Anti - Trust Act and prior to the year 1899 .	@@empty@@	unmatched

By the decree which was entered , it was adjudged that the combining of the stocks of various companies in the hands of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in 1899 constituted a combination in restraint of trade and also an attempt to monopolize and a monopolization under § 2 of the Anti - Trust Act . The decree was against seven individual defendants , the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey , thirty - six domestic companies , and one foreign company which the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey controls by stock ownership ; these 38 corporate defendants being held to be parties to the combination found to exist .

The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was enjoined from voting the stocks or exerting any control over the said 37 subsidiary companies , and the subsidiary companies were enjoined from paying any dividends as to the Standard Oil Company or permitting it to exercise any control over them by virtue of the stock ownership or power acquired by means of the combination . The individuals and corporations were also enjoined from entering into or carrying into effect any like combination which would evade the decree . Further , the individual defendants , the Standard Oil Company , and the 37 subsidiary corporations were enjoined from engaging or continuing in interstate commerce in petroleum or its products during the continuance of the illegal combination .	@@empty@@	unmatched
At the outset a question of jurisdiction requires consideration , and we shall , also , as a preliminary , dispose of another question , to the end that our attention may be completely concentrated upon the merits of the controversy when we come to consider them .	@@empty@@	unmatched
First . We are of opinion that , in consequence of the presence within the district of the Waters - Pierce Oil Company , the court , under the authority of § 5 of the Anti - Trust Act , rightly took jurisdiction over the cause and properly ordered notice to be served upon the nonresident defendants .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Second . The overruling of the exceptions taken to so much of the bill as counted upon facts occurring prior to the passage of the Anti - Trust Act -- whatever may be the view as an original question of the duty to restrict the controversy to a much narrower area than that propounded by the bill -- we think by no possibility in the present stage of the case can the action of the court be treated as prejudicial error justifying reversal . We say this because the court , as we shall do , gave no weight to the testimony adduced under the averments complained of except insofar as it tended to throw light upon the acts done after the [ p47 ] passage of the Anti - Trust Act and the results of which it was charged were being participated in and enjoyed by the alleged combination at the time of the filing of the bill .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We are thus brought face to face with the merits of the controversy .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Both as to the law and as to the facts , the opposing contentions pressed in the argument are numerous , and , in all their aspects , are so irreconcilable that it is difficult to reduce them to some fundamental generalization which , by being disposed of , would decide them all . For instance , as to the law . While both sides agree that the determination of the controversy rests upon the correct construction and application of the first and second sections of the Anti - Trust Act , yet the views as to the meaning of the act are as wide apart as the poles , since there is no real point of agreement on any view of the act . And this also is the case as to the scope and effect of authorities relied upon , even although , in some instances , one and the same authority is asserted to be controlling .	@@empty@@	unmatched
So also is it as to the facts . Thus , on the one hand , with relentless pertinacity and minuteness of analysis , it is insisted that the facts establish that the assailed combination took its birth in a purpose to unlawfully acquire wealth by oppressing the public and destroying the just rights of others , and that its entire career exemplifies an inexorable carrying out of such wrongful intents , since , it is asserted , the pathway of the combination , from the beginning to the time of the filing of the bill , is marked with constant proofs of wrong inflicted upon the public , and is strewn with the wrecks resulting from crushing out , without regard to law , the individual rights of others . Indeed , so conclusive , it is urged , is the proof on these subjects that it is asserted that the existence of the principal corporate defendant -- the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey -- with the vast accumulation of property which it owns or controls , because of its infinite potency [ p48 ] for harm and the dangerous example which its continued existence affords , is an open and enduring menace to all freedom of trade , and is a byword and reproach to modern economic methods . On the other hand , in a powerful analysis of the facts , it is insisted that they demonstrate that the origin and development of the vast business which the defendants control was but the result of lawful competitive methods , guided by economic genius of the highest order , sustained by courage , by a keen insight into commercial situations , resulting in the acquisition of great wealth , but at the same time serving to stimulate and increase production , to widely extend the distribution of the products of petroleum at a cost largely below that which would have otherwise prevailed , thus proving to be , at one and the same time , a benefaction to the general public as well as of enormous advantage to individuals . It is not denied that , in the enormous volume of proof contained in the record in the period of almost a lifetime to which that proof is addressed , there may be found acts of wrongdoing , but the insistence is that they were rather the exception than the rule , and , in most cases , were either the result of too great individual zeal in the keen rivalries of business or of the methods and habits of dealing which , even if wrong , were commonly practised at the time . And , to discover and state the truth concerning these contentions , both arguments call for the analysis and weighing , as we have said at the outset , of a jungle of conflicting testimony covering a period of forty years , a duty difficult to rightly perform and , even if satisfactorily accomplished , almost impossible to state with any reasonable regard to brevity .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Duly appreciating the situation just stated , it is certain that only one point of concord between the parties is discernable , which is that the controversy in every aspect is controlled by a correct conception of the meaning of the first and second sections of the Anti - Trust Act . We shall [ p49 ] therefore -- departing from what otherwise would be the natural order of analysis -- make this one point of harmony the initial basis of our examination of the contentions , relying upon the conception that , by doing so , some harmonious resonance may result adequate to dominate and control the discord with which the case abounds . That is to say , we shall first come to consider the meaning of the first and second sections of the Anti - Trust Act by the text , and , after discerning what by that process appears to be its true meaning , we shall proceed to consider the respective contentions of the parties concerning the act , the strength or weakness of those contentions , as well as the accuracy of the meaning of the act as deduced from the text in the light of the prior decisions of this court concerning it . When we have done this , we shall then approach the facts . Following this course , we shall make our investigation under four separate headings : First . The text of the first and second sections of the act originally considered , and its meaning in the light of the common law and the law of this country at the time of its adoption . Second . The contentions of the parties concerning the act , and the scope and effect of the decisions of this court upon which they rely . Third . The application of the statute to facts , and , Fourth . The remedy , if any , to be afforded as the result of such application .	@@empty@@	unmatched

We quote the text of the first and second sections of the act , as follows :	@@empty@@	unmatched
The debates show that doubt as to whether there was a common law of the United States which governed the subject in the absence of legislation was among the influences leading to the passage of the act . They conclusively show , however , that the main cause which led to the legislation was the thought that it was required by the economic condition of the times , that is , the vast accumulation of wealth in the hands of corporations and individuals , the enormous development of corporate organization , the facility for combination which such organizations afforded , the fact that the facility was being used , and that combinations known as trusts were being multiplied , and the widespread impression that their power had been and would be exerted to oppress individuals and injure the public generally . Although debates may not be used as a means for interpreting a statute ( United States v. Trans - Missouri Freight Association , 166 U.S. 318 , and cases cited ) that rule , in the nature of things , is not violated by resorting to debates as a means of ascertaining the environment at the time of the enactment of a particular law , that is , the history of the period when it was adopted .	@@empty@@	unmatched
There can be no doubt that the sole subject with which the first section deals is restraint of trade as therein contemplated , and that the attempt to monopolize and monopolization is the subject with which the second section [ p51 ] is concerned . It is certain that those terms , at least in their rudimentary meaning , took their origin in the common law , and were also familiar in the law of this country prior to and at the time of the adoption of the act in question .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We shall endeavor then , first to seek their meaning not by indulging in an elaborate and learned analysis of the English law and of the law of this country , but by making a very brief reference to the elementary and indisputable conceptions of both the English and American law on the subject prior to the passage of the Anti - Trust Act .	@@empty@@	unmatched
a. It is certain that , at a very remote period , the words " contract in restraint of trade " in England came to refer to some voluntary restraint put by contract by an individual on his right to carry on his trade or calling . Originally all such contracts were considered to be illegal , because it was deemed they were injurious to the public , as well as to the individuals who made them . In the interest of the freedom of individuals to contract , this doctrine was modified so that it was only when a restraint by contract was so general as to be coterminous with the kingdom that it was treated as void . That is to say , if the restraint was partial in its operation and was otherwise reasonable , the contract was held to be valid .	@@empty@@	unmatched

The frequent granting of monopolies and the struggle which led to a denial of the power to create them , that is to say , to the establishment that they were incompatible with the English constitution , is known to all , and need not be reviewed . The evils which led to the public outcry against monopolies and to the final denial of the power to make them may be thus summarily stated : 1 . The power which the monopoly gave to the one who enjoyed it to fix the price and thereby injure the public ; 2 . The power which it engendered of enabling a limitation on production ; and , 3 . The danger of deterioration in quality of the monopolized article which it was deemed was the inevitable resultant of the monopolistic control over its production and sale . As monopoly as thus conceived embraced only a consequence arising from an exertion of sovereign power , no express restrictions or prohibitions obtained against the creation by an individual of a monopoly as such . But as it was considered , at least so far as the necessaries of life were concerned , that individuals , by the abuse of their right to contract , might be able to usurp the power arbitrarily to enhance prices , one of the wrongs arising from monopoly , it came to be that laws were passed relating to offenses such as forestalling , regrating and engrossing by which prohibitions were placed upon the power of individuals to deal under such circumstances and conditions as , according to the conception of the times , created a presumption that the dealings were not simply the honest exertion of one 's right to contract for his own benefit unaccompanied by a wrongful motive to injure others , but were the consequence of a contract or course of dealing of such a character as to give rise to the presumption of an intent to injure others through the means , for instance , of a monopolistic increase of prices . [ p53 ] This is illustrated by the definition of engrossing found in the statute , 5 and 6 Edw . VI , ch . 14 , as follows :	@@empty@@	unmatched
As , by the statutes providing against engrossing , the quantity engrossed was not required to be the whole or a proximate part of the whole of an article , it is clear that there was a wide difference between monopoly and engrossing , etc . But , as the principal wrong which it was deemed would result from monopoly , that is , an enhancement of the price , was the same wrong to which it was thought the prohibited engrossment would give rise , it came to pass that monopoly and engrossing were regarded as virtually one and the same thing . In other words , the prohibited act of engrossing , because of its inevitable accomplishment of one of the evils deemed to be engendered by monopoly , came to be referred to as being a monopoly or constituting an attempt to monopolize . Thus , Pollexfen , in his argument in East India Company v. Sandys , Skin . 165 , 169 , said :	@@empty@@	unmatched
And , by operation of the mental process which led to considering as a monopoly acts which , although they did not constitute a monopoly , were thought to produce some of its baneful effects , so also because of the impediment or burden to the due course of trade which they produced , such acts came to be referred to as in restraint of trade . This is shown by my Lord Coke 's definition of monopoly as being	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is illustrated also by the definition which Hawkins gives of monopoly wherein it is said that the effect of monopoly is to restrain the citizen " from the freedom of manufacturing or trading which he had before . " And see especially the opinion of Parker , C.J. , in Mitchel v. Reynolds ( 1711 ) , 1 P. Williams , 181 , where a classification is made of monopoly which brings it generically within the description of restraint of trade .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Generalizing these considerations , the situation is this : 1 . That , by the common law , monopolies were unlawful because of their restriction upon individual freedom of contract and their injury to the public . 2 . That as to necessaries of life , the freedom of the individual to deal was restricted where the nature and character of the dealing was such as to engender the presumption of intent to bring about at least one of the injuries which it was deemed would result from monopoly , that is , an undue enhancement of price . 3 . That , to protect the freedom of contract of the individual not only in his own interest , but principally in the interest of the common weal , a contract of an individual by which he put an unreasonable restraint upon himself as to carrying on his trade or business [ p55 ] was void . And that , at common law , the evils consequent upon engrossing , etc . , caused those things to be treated as coming within monopoly , and sometimes to be called monopoly , and the same considerations caused monopoly , because of its operation and effect , to be brought within and spoken of generally as impeding the due course of , or being in restraint of , trade .	@@empty@@	unmatched
From the development of more accurate economic conceptions and the changes in conditions of society , it came to be recognized that the acts prohibited by the engrossing , forestalling , etc . , statutes did not have the harmful tendency which they were presumed to have when the legislation concerning them was enacted , and therefore did not justify the presumption which had previously been deduced from them , but , on the contrary , such acts tended to fructify and develop trade . See the statutes of 12th George III , ch . 71 , enacted in 1772 , and statute of 7 and 8 Victoria , ch . 24 , enacted in 1844 , repealing the prohibitions against engrossing , forestalling , etc . , upon the express ground that the prohibited acts had come to be considered as favorable to the development of , and not in restraint of , trade . It is remarkable that nowhere at common law can there be found a prohibition against the creation of monopoly by an individual . This would seem to manifest , either consciously or intuitively , a profound conception as to the inevitable operation of economic forces and the equipoise or balance in favor of the protection of the rights of individuals which resulted . That is to say , as it was deemed that monopoly in the concrete could only arise from an act of sovereign power , and , such sovereign power being restrained , prohibitions as to individuals were directed not against the creation of monopoly , but were only applied to such acts in relation to particular subjects as to which it was deemed , if not restrained , some of the consequences of monopoly might result . After all , this was but an instinctive recognition [ p56 ] of the truisms that the course of trade could not be made free by obstructing it , and that an individual 's right to trade could not be protected by destroying such right .	@@empty@@	unmatched
From the review just made , it clearly results that , outside of the restrictions resulting from the want of power in an individual to voluntarily and unreasonably restrain his right to carry on his trade or business , and outside of the want of right to restrain the free course of trade by contracts or acts which implied a wrongful purpose , freedom to contract and to abstain from contracting , and to exercise every reasonable right incident thereto , became the rule in the English law . The scope and effect of this freedom to trade and contract is clearly shown by the decision in Mogul Steamship Co. v. McGregor ( 1892 ) , A.C. 25 . While it is true that the decision of the House of Lords in the case in question was announced shortly after the passage of the Anti - Trust Act , it serves reflexly to show the exact state of the law in England at the time the Antitrust statute was enacted .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In this country also , the acts from which it was deemed there resulted a part , if not all , of the injurious consequences ascribed to monopoly came to be referred to as a monopoly itself . In other words , here , as had been the case in England , practical common sense caused attention to be concentrated not upon the theoretically correct name to be given to the condition or acts which gave rise to a harmful result , but to the result itself , and to the remedying of the evils which it produced . The statement just made is illustrated by an early statute of the Province of Massachusetts , that is , chap . 31 of the laws of 1778 - 1779 , by which monopoly and forestalling were expressly treated as one and the same thing .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It is also true that , while the principles concerning contracts in restraint of trade , that is , voluntary restraint put by a person on his right to pursue his calling , hence only operating subjectively , came generally to be recognized [ p57 ] in accordance with the English rule , it came moreover to pass that contracts or acts which it was considered had a monopolistic tendency , especially those which were thought to unduly diminish competition , and hence to enhance prices -- in other words , to monopolize -- came also in a generic sense to be spoken of and treated , as they had been in England , as restricting the due course of trade , and therefore as being in restraint of trade . The dread of monopoly as an emanation of governmental power , while it passed at an early date out of mind in this country as a result of the structure of our Government , did not serve to assuage the fear as to the evil consequences which might arise from the acts of individuals producing or tending to produce the consequences of monopoly . It resulted that treating such acts as we have said as amounting to monopoly , sometimes constitutional restrictions , again legislative enactments or judicial decisions , served to enforce and illustrate the purpose to prevent the occurrence of the evils recognized in the mother country as consequent upon monopoly , by providing against contracts or acts of individuals or combinations of individuals or corporations deemed to be conducive to such results . To refer to the constitutional or legislative provisions on the subject or many judicial decisions which illustrate it would unnecessarily prolong this opinion . We append in the margin a note to treatises , & c. , wherein are contained references to constitutional and statutory provisions and to numerous decisions , etc . , relating to the subject . [ n5 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
It will be found that , as modern conditions arose , the trend of legislation and judicial decision came more and more to adapt the recognized restrictions to new manifestations of conduct or of dealing which it was thought [ p58 ] justified the inference of intent to do the wrongs which it had been the purpose to prevent from the beginning . The evolution is clearly pointed out in National Cotton Oil Co. v. Texas , 197 U.S. 115 , and Shawnee Compress Co. v. Anderson , 209 U.S. 423 ; and , indeed , will be found to be illustrated in various aspects by the decisions of this court which have been concerned with the enforcement of the act we are now considering .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Without going into detail , and but very briefly surveying the whole field , it may be with accuracy said that the dread of enhancement of prices and of other wrongs which it was thought would flow from the undue limitation on competitive conditions caused by contracts or other acts of individuals or corporations led , as a matter of public policy , to the prohibition or treating as illegal all contracts or acts which were unreasonably restrictive of competitive conditions , either from the nature or character of the contract or act or where the surrounding circumstances were such as to justify the conclusion that they had not been entered into or performed with the legitimate purpose of reasonably forwarding personal interest and developing trade , but , on the contrary , were of such a character as to give rise to the inference or presumption that they had been entered into or done with the intent to do wrong to the general public and to limit the right of individuals , thus restraining the free flow of commerce and tending to bring about the evils , such as enhancement of prices , which were considered to be against public policy . It is equally true to say that the survey of the legislation in this country on this subject from the beginning will show , depending as it did upon the economic conceptions which obtained at the time when the legislation was adopted or judicial decision was rendered , that contracts or acts were at one time deemed to be of such a character as to justify the inference of wrongful intent which were , at another period , thought not to be [ p59 ] of that character . But this again , as we have seen , simply followed the line of development of the law of England .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Let us consider the language of the first and second sections , guided by the principle that , where words are employed in a statute which had at the time a well known meaning at common law or in the law of this country , they are presumed to have been used in that sense unless the context compels to the contrary . [ n6 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
As to the first section , the words to be interpreted are :	@@empty@@	unmatched
As there is no room for dispute that the statute was intended to formulate a rule for the regulation of interstate and foreign commerce , the question is what was the rule which it adopted ?	@@empty@@	unmatched
In view of the common law and the law in this country as to restraint of trade , which we have reviewed , and the illuminating effect which that history must have under the rule to which we have referred , we think it results :	@@empty@@	unmatched
a. That the context manifests that the statute was drawn in the light of the existing practical conception of the law of restraint of trade , because it groups as within that class not only contracts which were in restraint of trade in the subjective sense , but all contracts or acts which theoretically were attempts to monopolize , yet which , in practice , had come to be considered as in restraint of trade in a broad sense .	@@empty@@	unmatched
b. That , in view of the many new forms of contracts and combinations which were being evolved from existing economic conditions , it was deemed essential by an all - embracing enumeration to make sure that no form of contract or combination by which an undue restraint of [ p60 ] interstate or foreign commerce was brought about could save such restraint from condemnation . The statute , under this view , evidenced the intent not to restrain the right to make and enforce contracts , whether resulting from combination or otherwise , which did not unduly restrain interstate or foreign commerce , but to protect that commerce from being restrained by methods , whether old or new , which would constitute an interference that is an undue restraint .	@@empty@@	unmatched
c. And as the contracts or acts embraced in the provision were not expressly defined , since the enumeration addressed itself simply to classes of acts , those classes being broad enough to embrace every conceivable contract or combination which could be made concerning trade or commerce or the subjects of such commerce , and thus caused any act done by any of the enumerated methods anywhere in the whole field of human activity to be illegal if in restraint of trade , it inevitably follows that the provision necessarily called for the exercise of judgment which required that some standard should be resorted to for the purpose of determining whether the prohibitions contained in the statute had or had not in any given ease been violated . Thus , not specifying but indubitably contemplating and requiring a standard , it follows that it was intended that the standard of reason which had been applied at the common law , and in this country , in dealing with subjects of the character embraced by the statute , was intended to be the measure used for the purpose of determining whether , in a given case , a particular act had or had not brought about the wrong against which the statute provided .	@@empty@@	unmatched
And a consideration of the text of the second section serves to establish that it was intended to supplement the first , and to make sure that , by no possible guise could the public policy embodied in the first section be frustrated or evaded . The prohibitions of the second embrace [ p61 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
The commerce referred to by the words " any part , " construed in the light of the manifest purpose of the statute , has both a geographical and a distributive significance , that is , it includes any portion of the United States and anyone of the classes of things forming a part of interstate or foreign commerce .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Undoubtedly , the words " to monopolize " and " monopolize , " as used in the section , reach every act bringing about the prohibited results . The ambiguity , if any , is involved in determining what is intended by monopolize . But this ambiguity is readily dispelled in the light of the previous history of the law of restraint of trade to which we have referred , and the indication which it gives of the practical evolution by which monopoly and the acts which produce the same result as monopoly , that is , an undue restraint of the course of trade , all came to be spoken of as , and to be indeed synonymous with , restraint of trade . In other words , having , by the first section , forbidden all means of monopolizing trade , that is , unduly restraining it by means of every contract , combination , etc . , the second section seeks , if possible , to make the prohibitions of the act all the more complete and perfect by embracing all attempts to reach the end prohibited by the first section , that is , restraints of trade , by any attempt to monopolize , or monopolization thereof , even although the acts by which such results are attempted to be brought about or are brought about be not embraced within the general enumeration of the first section . And , of course , when the second section is thus harmonized with and made as it [ p62 ] was intended to be the complement of the first , it becomes obvious that the criteria to be resorted to in any given case for the purpose of ascertaining whether violations of the section have been committed is the rule of reason , guided by the established law and by the plain duty to enforce the prohibitions of the act , and thus the public policy which its restrictions were obviously enacted to subserve . And it is worthy of observation , as we have previously remarked concerning the common law , that , although the statute , by the comprehensiveness of the enumerations embodied in both the first and second sections , makes it certain that its purpose was to prevent undue restraints of every kind or nature , nevertheless , by the omission of any direct prohibition against monopoly in the concrete , it indicates a consciousness that the freedom of the individual right to contract , when not unduly or improperly exercised , was the most efficient means for the prevention of monopoly , since the operation of the centrifugal and centripetal forces resulting from the right to freely contract was the means by which monopoly would be inevitably prevented if no extraneous or sovereign power imposed it and no right to make unlawful contracts having a monopolistic tendency were permitted . In other words , that freedom to contract was the essence of freedom from undue restraint on the right to contract .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Clear as it seems to us is the meaning of the provisions of the statute in the light of the review which we have made , nevertheless , before definitively applying that meaning , it behooves us to consider the contentions urged on one side or the other concerning the meaning of the statute , which , if maintained , would give to it , in some aspects a much wider , and , in every view , at least a somewhat different , significance . And to do this brings us to the second question , which , at the outset , we have stated it was our purpose to consider and dispose of . [ p63 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
Second . The contentions of the parties as to the meaning of the statute and the decisions of this court relied upon concerning those contentions .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In substance , the propositions urged by the Government are reducible to this : that the language of the statute embraces every contract , combination , etc . , in restraint of trade , and hence its text leaves no room for the exercise of judgment , but simply imposes the plain duty of applying its prohibitions to every case within its literal language . The error involved lies in assuming the matter to be decided . This is true because , as the acts which may come under the classes stated in the first section and the restraint of trade to which that section applies are not specifically enumerated or defined , it is obvious that judgment must , in every case , be called into play in order to determine whether a particular act is embraced within the statutory classes , and whether , if the act is within such classes , its nature or effect causes it to be a restraint of trade within the intendment of the act . To hold to the contrary would require the conclusion either that every contract , act or combination , of any kind or nature , whether it operated a restraint on trade or not , was within the statute , and thus the statute would be destructive of all right to contract or agree or combine in any respect whatever as to subjects embraced in interstate trade or commerce , or if this conclusion were not reached , then the contention would require it to be held that , as the statute did not define the things to which it related , and excluded resort to the only means by which the acts to which it relates could be ascertained -- the light of reason -- the enforcement of the statute was impossible because of its uncertainty . The merely generic enumeration which the statute makes of the acts to which it refers and the absence of any definition of restraint of trade as used in the statute leaves room for but one conclusion , which is that it was expressly designed not to unduly limit the application [ p64 ] of the act by precise definition , but , while clearly fixing a standard , that is , by defining the ulterior boundaries which could not be transgressed with impunity , to leave it to be determined by the light of reason , guided by the principles of law and the duty to apply and enforce the public policy embodied in the statute , in every given case whether any particular act or contract was within the contemplation of the statute .	@@empty@@	unmatched
But , it is said , persuasive as these views may be , they may not be here applied , because the previous decisions of this court have given to the statute a meaning which expressly excludes the construction which must result from the reasoning stated . The cases are United States v. Freight Association , 166 U.S. 290 , and United States v. Joint Traffic Association , 171 U.S. 505 . Both the cases involved the legality of combinations or associations of railroads engaged in interstate commerce for the purpose of controlling the conduct of the parties to the association or combination in many particulars . The association or combination was assailed in each case as being in violation of the statute . It was held that they were . It is undoubted that , in the opinion in each case , general language was made use of which , when separated from its context , would justify the conclusion that it was decided that reason could not be resorted to for the purpose of determining whether the acts complained of were within the statute . It is , however , also true that the nature and character of the contract or agreement in each case was fully referred to , and suggestions as to their unreasonableness pointed out , in order to indicate that they were within the prohibitions of the statute . As the cases can not by any possible conception be treated as authoritative without the certitude that reason was resorted to for the purpose of deciding them , it follows as a matter of course that it must have been held by the light of reason , since the conclusion could not have been otherwise reached , that the assailed [ p65 ] contracts or agreements were within the general enumeration of the statute , and that their operation and effect brought about the restraint of trade which the statute prohibited . This being inevitable , the deduction can in reason only be this : that , in the cases relied upon , it having been found that the acts complained of were within the statute and operated to produce the injuries which the statute forbade , that resort to reason was not permissible in order to allow that to be done which the statute prohibited . This being true , the rulings in the cases relied upon , when rightly appreciated , were therefore this , and nothing more : that , as considering the contracts or agreements , their necessary effect and the character of the parties by whom they were made , they were clearly restraints of trade within the purview of the statute , they could not be taken out of that category by indulging in general reasoning as to the expediency or nonexpediency of having made the contracts or the wisdom or want of wisdom of the statute which prohibited their being made . That is to say , the cases but decided that the nature and character of the contracts , creating as they did a conclusive presumption which brought them within the statute , such result was not to be disregarded by the substitution of a judicial appreciation of what the law ought to be for the plain judicial duty of enforcing the law as it was made .	@@empty@@	unmatched
But , aside from reasoning , it is true to say that the cases relied upon do not , when rightly construed , sustain the doctrine contended , for is established by all of the numerous decisions of this court which have applied and enforced the Anti - Trust Act , since they all , in the very nature of things , rest upon the premise that reason was the guide by which the provisions of the act were in every case interpreted . Indeed , intermediate the decision of the two cases , that is , after the decision in the Freight Association Case and before the decision in the Joint Traffic Case , the case of Hopkins v. United States , 171 U.S. 578 , was decided , [ p66 ] the opinion being delivered by Mr. Justice Peckham , who wrote both the opinions in the Freight Association and the Joint Traffic cases . And , referring in the Hopkins case to the broad claim made as to the rule of interpretation announced in the Freight Association case , it was said ( p. 592 ) :	@@empty@@	unmatched
And , in the Joint Traffic case , this statement was expressly reiterated and approved and illustrated by example ; like limitation on the general language used in Freight Association and Joint Traffic cases is also the clear result of Bement v. National Harrow Co. , 186 U.S. 70 , 92 , and especially of Cincinnati Packet Co. v. Bay , 200 U.S. 179 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
If the criterion by which it is to be determined in all cases whether every contract , combination , etc . , is a restraint of trade within the intendment of the law is the direct or indirect effect of the acts involved , then , of course , the rule of reason becomes the guide , and the construction which we have given the statute , instead of being refuted by the cases relied upon , is by those cases demonstrated to be correct . This is true because , as the construction which we have deduced from the history of the act and the analysis of its text is simply that , in every case where it is claimed that an act or acts are in violation of the statute , the rule of reason , in the light of the principles of law and the public policy which the act embodies , must be applied . From this it follows , since that rule and the result of the test as to direct or indirect , in their ultimate aspect , come to one and the same thing , that the difference between the two is therefore only that which obtains between things which do not differ at all . [ p67 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
If it be true that there is this identity of result between the rule intended to be applied in the Freight Association Case , that is , the rule of direct and indirect , and the rule of reason which , under the statute as we construe it , should be here applied , it may be asked how was it that , in the opinion in the Freight Association Case , much consideration was given to the subject of whether the agreement or combination which was involved in that case could be taken out of the prohibitions of the statute upon the theory of its reasonableness . The question is pertinent , and must be fully and frankly met , for if it be now deemed that the Freight Association Case was mistakenly decided or too broadly stated , the doctrine which it announced should be either expressly overruled or limited .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The confusion which gives rise to the question results from failing to distinguish between the want of power to take a case which , by its terms , or the circumstances which surrounded it , considering among such circumstances the character of the parties , is plainly within the statute , out of the operation of the statute by resort to reason in effect to establish that the contract ought not to be treated as within the statute , and the duty in every case where it becomes necessary , from the nature and character of the parties , to decide whether it was within the statute to pass upon that question by the light of reason . This distinction , we think , serves to point out what , in its ultimate conception , was the thought underlying the reference to the rule of reason made in the Freight Association Case , especially when such reference is interpreted by the context of the opinion and in the light of the subsequent opinion in the Hopkins Case and in Cincinnati Packet Company v. Bay , 200 U.S. 179 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
And in order not in the slightest degree to be wanting in frankness , we say that , insofar , however , as by separating the general language used in the opinions in the Freight Association and Joint Traffic cases from the context [ p68 ] and the subject and parties with which the cases were concerned , it may be conceived that the language referred to conflicts with the construction which we give the statute , they are necessarily now limited and qualified . We see no possible escape from this conclusion if we are to adhere to the many cases decided in this court in which the Anti - Trust Law has been applied and enforced and if the duty to apply and enforce that law in the future is to continue to exist . The first is true because the construction which we now give the statute does not in the slightest degree conflict with a single previous case decided concerning the Anti - Trust Law aside from the contention as to the Freight Association and Joint Traffic cases , and because every one of those cases applied the rule of reason for the purpose of determining whether the subject before the court was within the statute . The second is also true , since , as we have already pointed out , unaided by the light of reason , it is impossible to understand how the statute may in the future be enforced and the public policy which it establishes be made efficacious .	@@empty@@	unmatched
So far as the objections of the defendants are concerned , they are all embraced under two headings :	@@empty@@	unmatched
a. That the act , even if the averments of the bill be true , can not be constitutionally applied , because to do so would extend the power of Congress to subjects dehors the reach of its authority to regulate commerce , by enabling that body to deal with mere questions of production of commodities within the States . But all the structure upon which this argument proceeds is based upon the decision in United States v. E. C. Knight Co. , 156 U.S. 1 . The view , however , which the argument takes of that case and the arguments based upon that view have been so repeatedly pressed upon this court in connection with the interpretation and enforcement of the Anti - Trust Act , and have been so necessarily and expressly decided to be unsound as to cause the contentions to be plainly foreclosed and to require no express [ p69 ] notice . United States v. Northern Securities Co. , 193 U.S. 197 , 334 ; Loewe v . Lawlor , 208 U.S. 274 ; Swift & Co. v. United States , 196 U.S. 375 ; Montague v. Lowry , 193 U.S. 38 ; Shawnee Compress Co. v. Anderson , 209 U.S. 423 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
b. Many arguments are pressed in various forms of statement which , in substance , amount to contending that the statute can not be applied under the facts of this case without impairing rights of property and destroying the freedom of contract or trade , which is essentially necessary to the wellbeing of society and which it is insisted is protected by the constitutional guaranty of due process of law . But the ultimate foundation of all these arguments is the assumption that reason may not be resorted to in interpreting and applying the statute , and therefore that the statute unreasonably restricts the right to contract and unreasonably operates upon the right to acquire and hold property . As the premise is demonstrated to be unsound by the construction we have given the statute , of course , the propositions which rest upon that premise need not be further noticed .	@@empty@@	unmatched
So far as the arguments proceed upon the conception that , in view of the generality of the statute , it is not susceptible of being enforced by the courts because it can not be carried out without a judicial exertion of legislative power , they are clearly unsound . The statute certainly generically enumerates the character of acts which it prohibits and the wrong which it was intended to prevent . The propositions therefore but insist that , consistently with the fundamental principles of due process of law , it never can be left to the judiciary to decide whether , in a given case , particular acts come within a generic statutory provision . But to reduce the propositions , however , to this their final meaning makes it clear that , in substance , they deny the existence of essential legislative authority and challenge the right of the judiciary to perform duties which that department of the government has exerted from [ p70 ] the beginning . This is so clear as to require no elaboration . Yet let us demonstrate that which needs no demonstration by a few obvious examples . Take , for instance , the familiar cases where the judiciary is called upon to determine whether a particular act or acts are within a given prohibition , depending upon wrongful intent . Take questions of fraud . Consider the power which must be exercised in every case where the courts are called upon to determine whether particular acts are invalid which are , abstractly speaking , in and of themselves valid , but which are asserted to be invalid because of their direct effect upon interstate commerce .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We come then to the third proposition requiring consideration , viz :	@@empty@@	unmatched
Third . The facts and the application of the statute to them .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Beyond dispute , the proofs establish substantially as alleged in the bill the following facts :	@@empty@@	unmatched
1 . The creation of the Standard Oil Company of Ohio ;	@@empty@@	unmatched
2 . The organization of the Standard Oil Trust of 1882 , and also a previous one of 1879 , not referred to in the bill , and the proceedings in the Supreme Court of Ohio , culminating in a decree based upon the finding that the company was unlawfully a party to that trust ; the transfer by the trustees of stocks in certain of the companies ; the contempt proceedings ; and , finally , the increase of the capital of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and the acquisition by that company of the shares of the stock of the other corporations in exchange for its certificates .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The vast amount of property and the possibilities of far - reaching control which resulted from the facts last stated are shown by the statement which we have previously annexed concerning the parties to the trust agreement of 1882 , and the corporations whose stock was held by the trustees under the trust and which came therefore to be held by the New Jersey corporation . But these statements do not with accuracy convey an appreciation of the [ p71 ] situation as it existed at the time of the entry of the decree below , since , during the more than ten years which elapsed between the acquiring by the New Jersey corporation of the stock and other property which was formerly held by the trustees under the trust agreement , the situation , of course , had somewhat changed , a change which , when analyzed in the light of the proof , we think establishes that the result of enlarging the capital stock of the New Jersey company and giving it the vast power to which we have referred produced its normal consequence , that is , it gave to the corporation , despite enormous dividends and despite the dropping out of certain corporations enumerated in the decree of the court below , an enlarged and more perfect sway and control over the trade and commerce in petroleum and its products . The ultimate situation referred to will be made manifest by an examination of § § 2 and 4 of the decree below , which are excerpted in the margin . [ n7 ] [ p72 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
Giving to the facts just stated , the weight which it was deemed they were entitled to , in the light afforded by the [ p73 ] proof of other cognate facts and circumstances , the court below held that the acts and dealings established by the [ p74 ] proof operated to destroy the " potentiality of competition " which otherwise would have existed to such an extent as to cause the transfers of stock which were made to the New Jersey corporation and the control which resulted over the many and various subsidiary corporations to be a combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of the first section of the act , but also to be an attempt to monopolize and a monopolization bringing about a perennial violation of the second section .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We see no cause to doubt the correctness of these conclusions , considering the subject from every aspect , that is , both in view of the facts established by the record and the necessary operation and effect of the law as we have [ p75 ] construed it upon the inferences deducible from the facts , for the following reasons :	@@empty@@	unmatched
a. Because the unification of power and control over petroleum and its products which was the inevitable result of the combining in the New Jersey corporation by the increase of its stock and the transfer to it of the stocks of so many other corporations , aggregating so vast a capital , gives rise , in and of itself , in the absence of countervailing circumstances , to say the least , to the prima facie presumption of intent and purpose to maintain the dominancy over the oil industry , not as a result of normal methods of industrial development , but by new means of combination which were resorted to in order that greater power might be added than would otherwise have arisen had normal methods been followed , the whole with the purpose of excluding others from the trade , and thus centralizing in the combination a perpetual control of the movements of petroleum and its products in the channels of interstate commerce .	@@empty@@	unmatched
b. Because the prima facie presumption of intent to restrain trade , to monopolize , and to bring about monopolization resulting from the act of expanding the stock of the New Jersey corporation and vesting it with such vast control of the oil industry , is made conclusive by considering , 1 , the conduct of the persons or corporations who were mainly instrumental in bringing about the extension of power in the New Jersey corporation before the consummation of that result and prior to the formation of the trust agreements of 1879 and 1882 2 , by considering the proof as to what was done under those agreements and the acts which immediately preceded the vesting of power in the New Jersey corporation , as well as by weighing the modes in which the power vested in that corporation has been exerted and the results which have arisen from it .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Recurring to the acts done by the individuals or corporations who were mainly instrumental in bringing about the [ p76 ] expansion of the New Jersey corporation during the period prior to the formation of the trust agreements of 1879 and 1882 , including those agreements , not for the purpose of weighing the substantial merit of the numerous charges of wrongdoing made during such period , but solely as an aid for discovering intent and purpose , we think no disinterested mind can survey the period in question without being irresistibly driven to the conclusion that the very genius for commercial development and organization which it would seem was manifested from the beginning soon begot an intent and purpose to exclude others which was frequently manifested by acts and dealings wholly inconsistent with the theory that they were made with the single conception of advancing the development of business power by usual methods , but which , on the contrary , necessarily involved the intent to drive others from the field , and to exclude them from their right to trade , and thus accomplish the mastery which was the end in view . And , considering the period from the date of the trust agreements of 1879 and 1882 up to the time of the expansion of the New Jersey corporation , the gradual extension of the power over the commerce in oil which ensued , the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio , the tardiness or reluctance in conforming to the commands of that decision , the method first adopted and that which finally culminated in the plan of the New Jersey corporation , all additionally serve to make manifest the continued existence of the intent which we have previously indicated and which , among other things , impelled the expansion of the New Jersey corporation . The exercise of the power which resulted from that organization fortifies the foregoing conclusions , since the development which came , the acquisition here and there which ensued of every efficient means by which competition could have been asserted , the slow but resistless methods which followed by which means of transportation were absorbed and brought under control , [ p77 ] the system of marketing which was adopted by which the country was divided into districts and the trade in each district in oil was turned over to a designated corporation within the combination and all others were excluded , all lead the mind up to a conviction of a purpose and intent which we think is so certain as practically to cause the subject not to be within the domain of reasonable contention .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The inference that no attempt to monopolize could have been intended , and that no monopolization resulted from the acts complained of , since it is established that a very small percentage of the crude oil produced was controlled by the combination , is unwarranted . As substantial power over the crude product was the inevitable result of the absolute control which existed over the refined product , the monopolization of the one carried with it the power to control the other , and if the inferences which this situation suggests were developed , which we deem it unnecessary to do , they might well serve to add additional cogency to the presumption of intent to monopolize which we have found arises from the unquestioned proof on other subjects .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We are thus brought to the last subject which we are called upon to consider , viz :	@@empty@@	unmatched
Fourth . The remedy to be administered .	@@empty@@	unmatched
It may be conceded that , ordinarily , where it was found that acts had been done in violation of the statute , adequate measure of relief would result from restraining the doing of such acts in the future . Swift v. United States , 196 U.S. 375 . But in a case like this , where the condition which has been brought about in violation of the statute , in and of itself , is not only a continued attempt to monopolize , but also a monopolization , the duty to enforce the statute requires the application of broader and more controlling remedies . As penalties which are not authorized by law may not be inflicted by judicial authority , it follows that , to meet the situation with which we are confronted , [ p78 ] the application of remedies two - fold in character becomes essential : 1st . To forbid the doing in the future of acts like those which we have found to have been done in the past which would be violative of the statute . 2d . The exertion of such measure of relief as will effectually dissolve the combination found to exist in violation of the statute , and thus neutralize the extension and continually operating force which the possession of the power unlawfully obtained has brought and will continue to bring about .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In applying remedies for this purpose , however , the fact must not be overlooked that injury to the public by the prevention of an undue restraint on , or the monopolization of , trade or commerce is the foundation upon which the prohibitions of the statute rest , and , moreover , that one of the fundamental purposes of the statute is to protect , not to destroy , rights of property .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Let us then , as a means of accurately determining what relief we are to afford , first come to consider what relief was afforded by the court below , in order to fix how far it is necessary to take from or add to that relief , to the end that the prohibitions of the statute may have complete and operative force .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The court below , by virtue of § § 1 , 2 , and 4 of its decree , which we have in part previously excerpted in the margin , adjudged that the New Jersey corporation , insofar as it held the stock of the various corporations recited in § § 2 and 4 of the decree or controlled the same was a combination in violation of the first section of the act , and an attempt to monopolize or a monopolization contrary to the second section of the act . It commanded the dissolution of the combination , and therefore , in effect , directed the transfer by the New Jersey corporation back to the stockholders of the various subsidiary corporations entitled to the same of the stock which had been turned over to the New Jersey company in exchange for its stock . To [ p79 ] make this command effective , § 5 of the decree forbade the New Jersey corporation from in any form or manner exercising any ownership or exerting any power directly or indirectly in virtue of its apparent title to the stocks of the subsidiary corporations , and prohibited those subsidiary corporations from paying any dividends to the New Jersey corporation or doing any act which would recognize further power in that company , except to the extent that it was necessary to enable that company to transfer the stock . So far as the owners of the stock of the subsidiary corporations and the corporations themselves were concerned , after the stock had been transferred , § 6 of the decree enjoined them from in any way conspiring or combining to violate the act or to monopolize or attempt to monopolize in virtue of their ownership of the stock transferred to them , and prohibited all agreements between the subsidiary corporations or other stockholders in the future , tending to produce or bring about further violations of the act .	@@empty@@	unmatched
By § 7 , pending the accomplishment of the dissolution of the combination by the transfer of stock and until it was consummated , the defendants named in § 2 , constituting all the corporations to which we have referred , were enjoined from engaging in or carrying on interstate commerce . And , by § 9 , among other things , a delay of thirty days was granted for the carrying into effect of the directions of the decree .	@@empty@@	unmatched
So far as the decree held that the ownership of the stock of the New Jersey corporation constituted a combination in violation of the first section and an attempt to create a monopoly or to monopolize under the second section and commanded the dissolution of the combination , the decree was clearly appropriate . And this also is true of § 5 of the decree , which restrained both the New Jersey corporation and the subsidiary corporations from doing anything which would recognize or give effect to further ownership [ p80 ] in the New Jersey corporation of the stocks which were ordered to be retransferred .	@@empty@@	unmatched
But the contention is that , insofar as the relief by way of injunction which was awarded by § 6 against the stockholders of the subsidiary corporations or the subsidiary corporations themselves after the transfer of stock by the New Jersey corporation was completed in conformity to the decree , the relief awarded was too broad : a. Because it was not sufficiently specific and tended to cause those who were within the embrace of the order to cease to be under the protection of the law of the land and required them to thereafter conduct their business under the jeopardy of punishments for contempt for violating a general injunction . New Haven R.R. v. Interstate Commerce Commission , 200 U.S. 404 . Besides , it is said that the restraint imposed by § 6 -- even putting out of view the consideration just stated -- was moreover calculated to do injury to the public , and , it may be , in and of itself , to produce the very restraint on the due course of trade which it was intended to prevent . We say this since it does not necessarily follow , because an illegal restraint of trade or an attempt to monopolize or a monopolization resulted from the combination and the transfer of the stocks of the subsidiary corporations to the New Jersey corporation , that a like restraint or attempt to monopolize or monopolization would necessarily arise from agreements between one or more of the subsidiary corporations after the transfer of the stock by the New Jersey corporation . For illustration , take the pipelines . By the effect of the transfer of the stock , the pipelines would come under the control of various corporations , instead of being subjected to a uniform control . If various corporations owning the lines determined in the public interests to so combine as to make a continuous line , such agreement or combination would not be repugnant to the act , and yet it might be restrained by the decree . As another example , take the [ p81 ] Union Tank Line Company , one of the subsidiary corporations , the owner practically of all the tank cars in use by the combination . If no possibility existed of agreements for the distribution of these cars among the subsidiary corporations , the most serious detriment to the public interest might result . Conceding the merit , abstractly considered , of these contentions , they are irrelevant . We so think , since we construe the sixth paragraph of the decree not as depriving the stockholders or the corporations , after the dissolution of the combination , of the power to make normal and lawful contracts or agreements , but as restraining them from , by any device whatever , recreating directly or indirectly the illegal combination which the decree dissolved . In other words , we construe the sixth paragraph of the decree not as depriving the stockholders or corporations of the right to live under the law of the land , but as compelling obedience to that law . As therefore the sixth paragraph , as thus construed , is not amenable to the criticism directed against it , and can not produce the harmful results which the arguments suggest it was obviously right . We think that , in view of the magnitude of the interests involved and their complexity , that the delay of thirty days allowed for executing the decree was too short , and should be extended so as to embrace a period of at least six months . So also , in view of the possible serious injury to result to the public from an absolute cessation of interstate commerce in petroleum and its products by such vast agencies as are embraced in the combination , a result which might arise from that portion of the decree which enjoined carrying on of interstate commerce not only by the New Jersey corporation , but by all the subsidiary companies until the dissolution of the combination by the transfer of the stocks in accordance with the decree , the injunction provided for in § 7 thereof should not have been awarded .	@@empty@@	unmatched
After Rodney Gant was arrested for driving with a suspended license , handcuffed , and locked in the back of a patrol car , police officers searched his car and discovered cocaine in the pocket of a jacket on the backseat . Because Gant could not have accessed his car to retrieve weapons or evidence at the time of the search , the Arizona Supreme Court held that the search - incident - to - arrest exception to the Fourth Amendments warrant requirement , as defined in Chimel v. California , 395 U. S. 752 ( 1969 ) , and applied to vehicle searches in New York v. Belton , 453 U. S. 454 ( 1981 ) , did not justify the search in this case . We agree with that conclusion .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
Under Chimel , police may search incident to arrest only the space within an arrestees  immediate control,  meaning the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence. 395 U. S. , at 763 . The safety and evidentiary justifications underlying Chimels reaching - distance rule determine Beltons scope . Accordingly , we hold that Belton does not authorize a vehicle search incident to a recent occupants arrest after the arrestee has been secured and can not access the interior of the vehicle . Consistent with the holding in Thornton v. United States , 541 U. S. 615 ( 2004 ) , and following the suggestion in Justice Scalias opinion concurring in the judgment in that case , i d . , at 632 , we also conclude that circumstances unique to the automobile context justify a search incident to arrest when it is reasonable to believe that evidence of the offense of arrest might be found in the vehicle .	@@empty@@	unmatched
On August 25 , 1999 , acting on an anonymous tip that the residence at 2524 North Walnut Avenue was being used to sell drugs , Tucson police officers Griffith and Reed knocked on the front door and asked to speak to the owner . Gant answered the door and , after identifying himself , stated that he expected the owner to return later . The officers left the residence and conducted a records check , which revealed that Gants drivers license had been suspended and there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest for driving with a suspended license .	@@empty@@	unmatched
When the officers returned to the house that evening , they found a man near the back of the house and a woman in a car parked in front of it . After a third officer arrived , they arrested the man for providing a false name and the woman for possessing drug paraphernalia . Both arrestees were handcuffed and secured in separate patrol cars when Gant arrived . The officers recognized his car as it entered the driveway , and Officer Griffith confirmed that Gant was the driver by shining a flashlight into the car as it drove by him . Gant parked at the end of the driveway , got out of his car , and shut the door . Griffith , who was about 30 feet away , called to Gant , and they approached each other , meeting 10-to-12 feet from Gants car . Griffith immediately arrested Gant and handcuffed him .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Because the other arrestees were secured in the only patrol cars at the scene , Griffith called for backup . When two more officers arrived , they locked Gant in the backseat of their vehicle . After Gant had been handcuffed and placed in the back of a patrol car , two officers searched his car : One of them found a gun , and the other discovered a bag of cocaine in the pocket of a jacket on the backseat .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Gant was charged with two offensespossession of a narcotic drug for sale and possession of drug paraphernalia ( i.e. , the plastic bag in which the cocaine was found ) . He moved to suppress the evidence seized from his car on the ground that the warrantless search violated the Fourth Amendment . Among other things , Gant argued that Belton did not authorize the search of his vehicle because he posed no threat to the officers after he was handcuffed in the patrol car and because he was arrested for a traffic offense for which no evidence could be found in his vehicle . When asked at the suppression hearing why the search was conducted , Officer Griffith responded : Because the law says we can do it. App . 75 .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
The trial court rejected the States contention that the officers had probable cause to search Gants car for contraband when the search began , i d . , at 18 , 30 , but it denied the motion to suppress . Relying on the fact that the police saw Gant commit the crime of driving without a license and apprehended him only shortly after he exited his car , the court held that the search was permissible as a search incident to arrest . Id. , at 37 . A jury found Gant guilty on both drug counts , and he was sentenced to a 3-year term of imprisonment .	@@empty@@	unmatched
After protracted state - court proceedings , the Arizona Supreme Court concluded that the search of Gants car was unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment . The courts opinion discussed at length our decision in Belton , which held that police may search the passenger compartment of a vehicle and any containers therein as a contemporaneous incident of an arrest of the vehicles recent occupant . 216 Ariz. 1 , 34 , 162 P. 3d 640 , 642643 ( 2007 ) ( citing 453 U. S. , at 460 ) . The court distinguished Belton as a case concerning the permissible scope of a vehicle search incident to arrest and concluded that it did not answer the threshold question whether the police may conduct a search incident to arrest at all once the scene is secure. 216 Ariz. , at 4 , 162 P. 3d , at 643 . Relying on our earlier decision in Chimel , the court observed that the search - incident - to - arrest exception to the warrant requirement is justified by interests in officer safety and evidence preservation . 216 Ariz. , at 4 , 162 P. 3d , at 643 . When the justifications underlying Chimel no longer exist because the scene is secure and the arrestee is handcuffed , secured in the back of a patrol car , and under the supervision of an officer, the court concluded , a warrantless search of the arrestees car can not be justified as necessary to protect the officers at the scene or prevent the destruction of evidence. Id. , at 5 , 162 P. 3d , at 644 . Accordingly , the court held that the search of Gants car was unreasonable .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
The dissenting justices would have upheld the search of Gants car based on their view that the validity of a Belton search … clearly does not depend on the presence of the Chimel rationales in a particular case. Id. , at 8 , 162 P. 3d , at 647 . Although they disagreed with the majoritys view of Belton , the dissenting justicesacknowledged that [t]he bright - line rule embraced in Belton has long been criticized and probably merits reconsideration. 216 Ariz. , at 10 , 162 P. 3d , at 649 . They thus add[ed their ] voice[s ] to the others that have urged the Supreme Court to revisit Belton. Id. , at 11 , 163 P. 3d , at 650 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The chorus that has called for us to revisit Belton includes courts , scholars , and Members of this Court who have questioned that decisions clarity and its fidelity to Fourth Amendment principles . We therefore granted the States petition for certiorari . 552 U. S. _ _ _ ( 2008 ) .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
Consistent with our precedent , our analysis begins , as it should in every case addressing the reasonableness of a warrantless search , with the basic rule that searches conducted outside the judicial process , without prior approval by judge or magistrate , are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendmentsubject only to a few specifically established and well - delineated exceptions. Katz v. United States , 389 U. S. 347 , 357 ( 1967 ) ( footnote omitted ) . Among the exceptions to the warrant requirement is a search incident to a lawful arrest . See Weeks v. United States , 232 U. S. 383 , 392 ( 1914 ) . The exception derives from interests in officer safety and evidence preservation that are typically implicated in arrest situations . See United States v. Robinson , 414 U. S. 218 , 230234 ( 1973 ) ; Chimel , 395 U. S. , at 763 .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
In Chimel , we held that a search incident to arrest may only include the arrestees person and the area within his immediate controlconstruing that phrase to mean the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence. Ibid . That limitation , which continues to define the boundaries of the exception , ensures that the scope of a search incident to arrest is commensurate with its purposes of protecting arresting officers and safeguarding any evidence of the offense of arrest that an arrestee might conceal or destroy . See ibid . ( noting that searches incident to arrest are reasonable in order to remove any weapons [ the arrestee ] might seek to use and in order to prevent [ the ] concealment or destruction of evidence ( emphasis added ) ) . If there is no possibility that an arrestee could reach into the area that law enforcement officers seek to search , both justifications for the search - incident - to - arrest exception are absent and the rule does not apply . E.g. , Preston v. United States , 376 U. S. 364 , 367368 ( 1964 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In Belton , we considered Chimelsapplication to the automobile context . A lone police officer in that case stopped a speeding car in which Belton was one of four occupants . While asking for the drivers license and registration , the officer smelled burnt marijuana and observed an envelope on the car floor marked Supergolda name he associated with marijuana . Thus having probable cause to believe the occupants had committed a drug offense , the officer ordered them out of the vehicle , placed them under arrest , and patted them down . Without handcuffing the arrestees , 1 the officer  split them up into four separate areas of the Thruway … so they would not be in physical touching area of each other  and searched the vehicle , including the pocket of a jacket on the backseat , in which he found cocaine . 453 U. S. , at 456 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The New York Court of Appeals found the search unconstitutional , concluding that after the occupants were arrested the vehicle and its contents were safely within the exclusive custody and control of the police. State v. Belton , 50 N. Y. 2d 447 , 452 , 407 N. E. 2d 420 , 423 ( 1980 ) . The State asked this Court to consider whether the exception recognized in Chimel permits an officer to search a jacket found inside an automobile while the automobiles four occupants , all under arrest , are standing unsecured around the vehicle. Brief in No . 80328 , p. i. We granted certiorari because courts ha[d ] found no workable definition of the area within the immediate control of the arrestee when that area arguably includes the interior of an automobile. 453 U. S. , at 460 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In its brief , the State argued that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the jacket was under the officers exclusive control . Focusing on the number of arrestees and their proximity to the vehicle , the State asserted that it was reasonable for the officer to believe the arrestees could have accessed the vehicle and its contents , making the search permissible under Chimel . Brief in No . 80328 , at 78 . The United States , as amicus curiae in support of the State , argued for a more permissive standard , but it maintained that any search incident to arrest must be  substantially contemporaneous  with the arresta requirement it deemed satisfied if the search occurs during the period in which the arrest is being consummated and before the situation has so stabilized that it could be said that the arrest was completed. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in New York v. Belton , O. T. 1980 , No . 80328 , p. 14 . There was no suggestion by the parties or amici that Chimel authorizes a vehicle search incident to arrest when there is no realistic possibility that an arrestee could access his vehicle .	@@empty@@	unmatched
After considering these arguments , we held that when an officer lawfully arrests the occupant of an automobile , he may , as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest , search the passenger compartment of the automobile and any containers therein . Belton,453 U. S. , at 460 ( footnote omitted ) . That holding was based in large part on our assumption that articles inside the relatively narrow compass of the passenger compartment of an automobile are in fact generally , even if not inevitably , within the area into which an arrestee might reach.  Ibid .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Arizona Supreme Court read our decision in Belton as merely delineatingthe proper scope of a search of the interior of an automobile incident to an arrest , i d . , at 459.That is , when the passenger compartment is within an arrestees reaching distance , Belton supplies the generalization that the entire compartment and any containers therein may be reached . On that view of Belton , the state court concluded that the search of Gants car was unreasonable because Gant clearly could not have accessed his car at the time of the search . It also found that no other exception to the warrant requirement applied in this case .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Gant now urges us to adopt the reading of Belton followed by the Arizona Supreme Court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Despite the textual and evidentiary support for the Arizona Supreme Courts reading of Belton , our opinion has been widely understood to allow a vehicle search incident to the arrest of a recent occupant even if there is no possibility the arrestee could gain access to the vehicle at the time of the search . This reading may be attributable to Justice Brennans dissent in Belton , in which he characterized the Courts holding as resting on the fiction … that the interior of a car is always within the immediate control of an arrestee who has recently been in the car. 453 U. S. , at 466 . Under the majoritys approach , he argued , the result would presumably be the same even if [ the officer ] had handcuffed Belton and his companions in the patrol car before conducting the search . Id. , at 468 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Since we decided Belton , Courts of Appeals have given different answers to the question whether a vehicle must be within an arrestees reach to justify a vehicle search incident to arrest , 2 but Justice Brennans reading of the Courts opinion has predominated . As Justice OConnor observed , lower court decisions seem now to treat the ability to search a vehicle incident to the arrest of a recent occupant as a police entitlement rather than as an exception justified by the twin rationales of Chimel. Thornton , 541 U. S. , at 624 ( opinion concurring in part ) . Justice Scalia has similarly noted that , although it is improbable that an arrestee could gain access to weapons stored in his vehicle after he has been handcuffed and secured in the backseat of a patrol car , cases allowing a search in this precise factual scenario … are legion. Id. , at 628 ( opinion concurring in judgment ) ( collecting cases ) . 3 Indeed , some courts have upheld searches under Belton even when … the handcuffed arrestee has already left the scene. 541 U. S. , at 628 ( same ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Under this broad reading of Belton , a vehicle search would be authorized incident to every arrest of a recent occupant notwithstanding that in most cases the vehicles passenger compartment will not be within the arrestees reach at the time of the search . To read Belton as authorizing a vehicle search incident to every recent occupants arrest would thus untether the rule from the justifications underlying the Chimel exceptiona result clearly incompatible with our statement in Belton that it in no way alters the fundamental principles established in the Chimel case regarding the basic scope of searches incident to lawful custodial arrests. 453 U. S. , at 460 , n. 3 . Accordingly , we reject this reading of Belton and hold that the Chimel rationale authorizes police to search a vehicle incident to a recent occupants arrest only when the arrestee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search . 4	@@empty@@	unmatched
Although it does not follow from Chimel , we also conclude that circumstances unique to the vehicle context justify a search incident to a lawful arrest when it is reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle. Thornton,541 U. S. , at 632 ( Scalia , J. , concurring in judgment ) . In many cases , as when a recent occupant is arrested for a traffic violation , there will be no reasonable basis to believe the vehicle contains relevant evidence . See , e.g. , Atwater v. Lago Vista , 532 U. S. 318 , 324 ( 2001 ) ; Knowles v. Iowa , 525 U. S. 113 , 118 ( 1998 ) . But in others , including Belton and Thornton , the offense of arrest will supply a basis for searching the passenger compartment of an arrestees vehicle and any containers therein .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Neither the possibility of access nor the likelihood of discovering offense - related evidence authorized the search in this case . Unlike in Belton , which involved a single officer confronted with four unsecured arrestees , the five officers in this case outnumbered the three arrestees , all of whom had been handcuffed and secured in separate patrol cars before the officers searched Gants car . Under those circumstances , Gant clearly was not within reaching distance of his car at the time of the search . An evidentiary basis for the search was also lacking in this case . Whereas Belton and Thornton were arrested for drug offenses , Gant was arrested for driving with a suspended licensean offense for which police could not expect to find evidence in the passenger compartment of Gants car . Cf . Knowles , 525 U. S. , at 118 . Because police could not reasonably have believed either that Gant could have accessed his car at the time of the search or that evidence of the offense for which he was arrested might have been found therein , the search in this case was unreasonable .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The State does not seriously disagree with the Arizona Supreme Courts conclusion that Gant could not have accessed his vehicle at the time of the search , but it nevertheless asks us to uphold the search of his vehicle under the broad reading of Belton discussed above . The State argues that Belton searches are reasonable regardless of the possibility of access in a given case because that expansive rule correctly balances law enforcement interests , including the interest in a bright - line rule , with an arrestees limited privacy interest in his vehicle .	@@empty@@	unmatched
For several reasons , we reject the States argument . First , the State seriously undervalues the privacy interests at stake . Although we have recognized that a motorists privacy interest in his vehicle is less substantial than in his home , see New York v. Class , 475 U. S. 106 , 112113 ( 1986 ) , the former interest is nevertheless important and deserving of constitutional protection , see Knowles , 525 U. S. , at 117 . It is particularly significant that Belton searches authorize police officers to search not just the passenger compartment but every purse , briefcase , or other container within that space . A rule that gives police the power to conduct such a search whenever an individual is caught committing a traffic offense , when there is no basis for believing evidence of the offense might be found in the vehicle , creates a serious and recurring threat to the privacy of countless individuals . Indeed , the character of that threat implicates the central concern underlying the Fourth Amendmentthe concern about giving police officers unbridled discretion to rummage at will among a persons private effects . 5	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
At the same time as it undervalues these privacy concerns , the State exaggerates the clarity that its reading of Belton provides . Courts that have read Belton expansively are at odds regarding how close in time to the arrest and how proximate to the arrestees vehicle an officers first contact with the arrestee must be to bring the encounter within Beltons purview 6 and whether a search is reasonable when it commences or continues after the arrestee has been removed from the scene . 7 The rule has thus generated a great deal of uncertainty , particularly for a rule touted as providing a bright line. See 3 LaFave , § 7.1(c ) , at 514524 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Contrary to the States suggestion , a broad reading of Belton is also unnecessary to protect law enforcement safety and evidentiary interests . Under our view , Belton and Thornton permit an officer to conduct a vehicle search when an arrestee is within reaching distance of the vehicle or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest . Other established exceptions to the warrant requirement authorize a vehicle search under additional circumstances when safety or evidentiary concerns demand . For instance , Michigan v. Long , 463 U. S. 1032 ( 1983 ) , permits an officer to search a vehicles passenger compartment when he has reasonable suspicion that an individual , whether or not the arrestee , is dangerous and might access the vehicle to gain immediate control of weapons. Id. , at 1049 ( citing Terry v. Ohio , 392 U. S. 1 , 21 ( 1968 ) ) . If there is probable cause to believe a vehicle contains evidence of criminal activity , United States v. Ross , 456 U. S. 798 , 820821 ( 1982 ) , authorizes a search of any area of the vehicle in which the evidence might be found . Unlike the searches permitted by Justice Scalias opinion concurring in the judgment in Thornton , which we conclude today are reasonable for purposes of the Fourth Amendment , Ross allows searches for evidence relevant to offenses other than the offense of arrest , and the scope of the search authorized is broader . Finally , there may be still other circumstances in which safety or evidentiary interests would justify a search . Cf . Maryland v. Buie , 494 U. S. 325 , 334 ( 1990 ) ( holding that , incident to arrest , an officer may conduct a limited protective sweep of those areas of a house in which he reasonably suspects a dangerous person may be hiding ) .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
These exceptions together ensure that officers may search a vehicle when genuine safety or evidentiary concerns encountered during the arrest of a vehicles recent occupant justify a search . Construing Belton broadly to allow vehicle searches incident to any arrest would serve no purpose except to provide a police entitlement , and it is anathema to the Fourth Amendment to permit a warrantless search on that basis . For these reasons , we are unpersuaded by the States arguments that a broad reading of Belton would meaningfully further law enforcement interests and justify a substantial intrusion on individuals privacy . 8	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
Our dissenting colleagues argue that the doctrine of stare decisis requires adherence to a broad reading of Belton even though the justifications for searching a vehicle incident to arrest are in most cases absent . 9 The doctrine of stare decisis is of course essential to the respect accorded to the judgments of the Court and to the stability of the law, but it does not compel us to follow a past decision when its rationale no longer withstands careful analysis. Lawrence v. Texas , 539 U. S. 558 , 577 ( 2003 ) .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We have never relied on stare decisis to justify the continuance of an unconstitutional police practice . And we would be particularly loath to uphold an unconstitutional result in a case that is so easily distinguished from the decisions that arguably compel it . The safety and evidentiary interests that supported the search in Belton simply are not present in this case . Indeed , it is hard to imagine two cases that are factually more distinct , as Belton involved one officer confronted by four unsecured arrestees suspected of committing a drug offense and this case involves several officers confronted with a securely detained arrestee apprehended for driving with a suspended license . This case is also distinguishable from Thornton , in which the petitioner was arrested for a drug offense . It is thus unsurprising that Members of this Court who concurred in the judgments in Belton and Thornton also concur in the decision in this case . 10	@@empty@@	unmatched
We do not agree with the contention in Justice Alitos dissent ( hereinafter dissent ) that consideration of police reliance interests requires a different result . Although it appears that the States reading of Belton has been widely taught in police academies and that law enforcement officers have relied on the rule in conducting vehicle searches during the past 28 years , 11 many of these searches were not justified by the reasons underlying the Chimel exception . Countless individuals guilty of nothing more serious than a traffic violation have had their constitutional right to the security of their private effects violated as a result . The fact that the law enforcement community may view the States version of the Belton rule as an entitlement does not establish the sort of reliance interest that could outweigh the countervailing interest that all individuals share in having their constitutional rights fully protected . If it is clear that a practice is unlawful , individuals interest in its discontinuance clearly outweighs any law enforcement entitlement to its persistence . Cf . Mincey v. Arizona , 437 U. S. 385 , 393 ( 1978 ) ( [T]he mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the Fourth Amendment ) . The dissents reference in this regard to the reliance interests cited in Dickerson v. United States , 530 U. S. 428 ( 2000 ) , is misplaced . See post , at 5 . In observing that Miranda has become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture, 530 U. S. , at 443 , the Court was referring not to policereliance on a rule requiring them to provide warnings but to the broader societal reliance on that individual right .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
The dissent also ignores the checkered history of the search - incident - to - arrest exception . Police authority to search the place in which a lawful arrest is made was broadly asserted in Marron v. United States , 275 U. S. 192 ( 1927 ) , and limited a few years later in Go - Bart Importing Co. v. United States , 282 U. S. 344 ( 1931 ) , and United States v. Lefkowitz , 285 U. S. 452 ( 1932 ) . The limiting views expressed in Go - Bart and Lefokwitz were in turn abandoned in Harris v. United States , 331 U. S. 145 ( 1947 ) , which upheld a search of a four - room apartment incident to the occupants arrest . Only a year later the Court in Trupiano v. United States , 334 U. S. 699 , 708 ( 1948 ) , retreated from that holding , noting that the search - incident - to - arrest exception is a strictly limited one that must be justified by something more in the way of necessity than merely a lawful arrest. And just two years after that , in United States v. Rabinowitz , 339 U. S. 56 ( 1950 ) , the Court again reversed course and upheld the search of an entire apartment . Finally , our opinion in Chimel overruled Rabinowitz and what remained of Harris and established the present boundaries of the search - incident - to - arrest exception . Notably , none of the dissenters in Chimel or the cases that preceded it argued that law enforcement reliance interests outweighed the interest in protecting individual constitutional rights so as to warrant fidelity to an unjustifiable rule .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The experience of the 28 years since we decided Belton has shown that the generalization underpinning the broad reading of that decision is unfounded . We now know that articles inside the passenger compartment are rarely within the area into which an arrestee might reach,  453 U. S. , at 460 , and blind adherence to Beltons faulty assumption would authorize myriad unconstitutional searches . The doctrine of stare decisis does not require us to approve routine constitutional violations .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Police may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupants arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest . When these justifications are absent , a search of an arrestees vehicle will be unreasonable unless police obtain a warrant or show that another exception to the warrant requirement applies . The Arizona Supreme Court correctly held that this case involved an unreasonable search . Accordingly , the judgment of the State Supreme Court is affirmed .	@@empty@@	unmatched
I agree with Justice Alito that New York v. Belton , 453 U. S. 454 ( 1981 ) , is best read as setting forth a bright - line rule that permits a warrantless search of the passenger compartment of an automobile incident to the lawful arrest of an occupantregardless of the danger the arrested individual in fact poses . I also agree with Justice Stevens , however , that the rule can produce results divorced from its underlying Fourth Amendment rationale . Compare Belton , supra , with Chimel v. California , 395 U. S. 752 , 764 ( 1969 ) ( explaining that the rule allowing contemporaneous searches is justified by the need to prevent harm to a police officer or destruction of evidence of the crime ) . For that reason I would look for a better rulewere the question before us one of first impression .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	23
The matter , however , is not one of first impression , and that fact makes a substantial difference . The Belton rule has been followed not only by this Court in Thornton v. United States , 541 U. S. 615 ( 2004 ) , but also by numerous other courts . Principles of stare decisis must apply , and those who wish this Court to change a well - established legal precedentwhere , as here , there has been considerable reliance on the legal rule in questionbear a heavy burden . Cf . Leegin Creative Leather Products , Inc. v. PSKS , Inc. , 551 U. S. 877 , _ _ _ ( 2007 ) ( slip op . , at 1719 ) ( Breyer , J. , dissenting ) . I have not found that burden met . Nor do I believe that the other considerations ordinarily relevant when determining whether to overrule a case are satisfied . I consequently join Justice Alitos dissenting opinion with the exception of Part II - E.	@@empty@@	unmatched

MR . JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A grave responsibility confronts this Court whenever , in course of litigation , it must reconcile the conflicting claims of liberty and authority . But when the liberty invoked is liberty of conscience , and the authority is authority to safeguard the nation 's fellowship , judicial conscience is put to its severest test . Of such a nature is the present controversy .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Lillian Gobitis , aged twelve , and her brother William , aged ten , were expelled from the public schools of Minersville , Pennsylvania , for refusing to salute the national flag as part of a daily school exercise . The local Board of Education required both teachers and pupils to participate in this ceremony . The ceremony is a familiar one . The right hand is placed on the breast and the following pledge recited in unison : " I pledge allegiance to my flag , and to the Republic for which it stands ; one nation indivisible , with liberty and justice for all . " While the words are spoken , teachers and pupils extend their right hands in salute to the flag . The Gobitis family are affiliated with " Jehovah 's Witnesses , " for whom the Bible as the Word of God is the supreme authority . The children [ p592 ] had been brought up conscientiously to believe that such a gesture of respect for the flag was forbidden by command of Scripture . [ n1 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Gobitis children were of an age for which Pennsylvania makes school attendance compulsory . Thus , they were denied a free education , and their parents had to put them into private schools . To be relieved of the financial burden thereby entailed , their father , on behalf of the children and in his own behalf , brought this suit . He sough to enjoin the authorities from continuing to exact participation in the flag salute ceremony as a condition of his children 's attendance at the Minersville school . After trial of the issues , Judge Maris gave relief in the District Court , 24 F.Supp . 271 , on the basis of a thoughtful opinion at a preliminary stage of the litigation , 21 F.Supp . 581 ; his decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals , 108 F.2d 683 . Since this decision ran counter to several per curiam dispositions of this Court , [ n2 ] we granted certiorari to give the matter full reconsideration . 309 U.S. 645 . By their able submissions , he Committee on the Bill of Rights of the American Bar Association and the American Civil Liberties Union , as friends of the Court , have helped us to our conclusion .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We must decide whether the requirement of participation in such a ceremony , exacted from a child who refuses [ p593 ] upon sincere religious grounds , infringes without due process of law the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Centuries of strife over the erection of particular dogmas as exclusive or all - comprehending faiths led to the inclusion of a guarantee for religious freedom in the Bill of Rights . The First Amendment , and the Fourteenth through its absorption of the First , sought to guard against repetition of those bitter religious struggles by prohibiting the establishment of a state religion and by securing to every sect the free exercise of its faith . So pervasive is the acceptance of this precious right that its scope is brought into question , as here , only when the conscience of individuals collides with the felt necessities of society .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Certainly the affirmative pursuit of one 's convictions about the ultimate mystery of the universe and man 's relation to it is placed beyond the reach of law . Government may not interfere with organized or individual expression of belief or disbelief . Propagation of belief -- or even of disbelief -- in the supernatural is protected , whether in church or chapel , mosque or synagogue , tabernacle or meetinghouse . Likewise , the Constitution assures generous immunity to the individual from imposition of penalties for offending , in the course of his own religious activities , the religious views of others , be they a minority or those who are dominant in government . Cantwell v. Connecticut , ante , p. 296 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
But the manifold character of man 's relations may bring his conception of religious duty into conflict with the secular interests of his fellow men . When does the constitutional guarantee compel exemption from doing what society thinks necessary for the promotion of some great common end , or from a penalty for conduct which appears dangerous to the general good ? To state the [ p594 ] problem is to recall the truth that no single principle can answer all of life 's complexities . The right to freedom of religious belief , however dissident and however obnoxious to the cherished beliefs of others -- even of a majority -- is itself the denial of an absolute . But to affirm that the freedom to follow conscience has itself no limits in the life of a society would deny that very plurality of principles which , as a matter of history , underlies protection of religious toleration . Compare Mr. Justice Holmes in Hudson Water Co. v. McCarter , 209 U.S. 349 , 355 . Our present task , then , as so often the case with courts , is to reconcile two rights in order to prevent either from destroying the other . But , because , in safeguarding conscience , we are dealing with interests so subtle and so dear , every possible leeway should be given to the claims of religious faith .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In the judicial enforcement of religious freedom , we are concerned with a historic concept . See Mr. Justice Cardozo in Hamilton v. Regents , 293 U.S. at 265 . The religious liberty which the Constitution protects has never excluded legislation of general scope not directed against doctrinal loyalties of particular sects . Judicial nullification of legislation can not be justified by attributing to the framers of the Bill of Rights views for which there is no historic warrant . Conscientious scruples have not , in the course of the long struggle for religious toleration , relieved the individual from obedience to a general law not aimed at the promotion or restriction of religious beliefs . [ n3 ] The mere possession of religious convictions [ p595 ] which contradict the relevant concerns of a political society does not relieve the citizen from the discharge of political responsibilities . The necessity for this adjustment has again and again been recognized . In a number of situations , the exertion of political authority has been sustained , while basic considerations of religious freedom have been left inviolate . Reynolds v. United States , 98 U.S. 145 ; Davis v. Beason , 133 U.S. 333 ; Selective Draft Law Cases , 245 U.S. 366 ; Hamilton v. Regents , 293 U.S. 245 . In all these cases , the general laws in question , upheld in their application to those who refused obedience from religious conviction , were manifestations of specific powers of government deemed by the legislature essential to secure and maintain that orderly , tranquil , and free society without which religious toleration itself is unattainable . Nor does the freedom of speech assured by Due Process move in a more absolute circle of immunity than that enjoyed by religious freedom . Even if it were assumed that freedom of speech goes beyond the historic concept of full opportunity to utter and to disseminate views , however heretical or offensive to dominant opinion , and includes freedom from conveying what may be deemed an implied but rejected affirmation , the question remains whether school children , like the Gobitis children , must be excused from conduct required of all the other children in the promotion of national cohesion . We are dealing with an interest inferior to none in the hierarchy of legal values . National unity is the basis of national security . To deny the legislature the right to select appropriate means for its attainment presents a totally different order of problem from that of the propriety of subordinating the possible ugliness of littered streets to the free expression of opinion through distribution of handbills . Compare Schneider v. State , 308 U.S. 147 . [ p596 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
Situations like the present are phases of the profoundest problem confronting a democracy -- the problem which Lincoln cast in memorable dilemma : " Must a government of necessity be too strong for the liberties of its people , or too weak to maintain its own existence ? " No mere textual reading or logical talisman can solve the dilemma . And when the issue demands judicial determination , it is not the personal notion of judges of what wise adjustment requires which must prevail .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Unlike the instances we have cited , the case before us is not concerned with an exertion of legislative power for the promotion of some specific need or interest of secular society -- the protection of the family , the promotion of health , the common defense , the raising of public revenues to defray the cost of government . But all these specific activities of government presuppose the existence of an organized political society . The ultimate foundation of a free society is the binding tie of cohesive sentiment . Such a sentiment is fostered by all those agencies of the mind and spirit which may serve to gather up the traditions of a people , transmit them from generation to generation , and thereby create that continuity of a treasured common life which constitutes a civilization . " We live by symbols . " The flag is the symbol of our national unity , transcending all internal differences , however large , within the framework of the Constitution .

The case before us must be viewed as though the legislature of Pennsylvania had itself formally directed the flag salute for the children of Minersville ; had made no exemption for children whose parents were possessed of conscientious scruples like those of the Gobitis family , and had indicated its belief in the desirable ends to be secured by having its public school children share a common experience at those periods of development when their minds are supposedly receptive to its assimilation , by an exercise appropriate in time and place and setting , and one designed to evoke in them appreciation of the nation 's hopes and dreams , its sufferings and sacrifices . The precise issue , then , for us to decide is whether the legislatures of the various states and the authorities in a thousand counties and school districts of this country are barred from determining the appropriateness of various means to evoke that unifying sentiment without which there can ultimately be no liberties , civil or religious . [ n5 ] To stigmatize legislative judgment in providing for this universal gesture of respect for the symbol of our national life in the setting of the common school as a lawless inroad on that freedom of conscience which the Constitution protects , would amount to no less than the pronouncement of pedagogical and psychological dogma in a field where courts possess no marked and certainly no [ p598 ] controlling competence . The influences which help toward a common feeling for the common country are manifold . Some may seem harsh , and others no doubt are foolish . Surely , however , the end is legitimate . And the effective means for its attainment are still so uncertain and so unauthenticated by science as to preclude us from putting the widely prevalent belief in flag saluting beyond the pale of legislative power . It mocks reason and denies our whole history to find in the allowance of a requirement to salute our flag on fitting occasions the seeds of sanction for obeisance to a leader .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The wisdom of training children in patriotic impulses by those compulsions which necessarily pervade so much of the educational process is not for our independent judgment . Even were we convinced of the folly of such a measure , such belief would be no proof of its unconstitutionality . For ourselves , we might be tempted to say that the deepest patriotism is best engendered by giving unfettered scope to the most crochety beliefs . Perhaps it is best , even from the standpoint of those interests which ordinances like the one under review seek to promote , to give to the least popular sect leave from conformities like those here in issue . But the courtroom is not the arena for debating issues of educational policy . It is not our province to choose among competing considerations in the subtle process of securing effective loyalty to the traditional ideals of democracy , while respecting at the same time individual idiosyncracies among a people so diversified in racial origins and religious allegiances . So to hold would , in effect , make us the school board for the country . That authority has not been given to this Court , nor should we assume it .	@@empty@@	unmatched
We are dealing here with the formative period in the development of citizenship . Great diversity of psychological and ethical opinion exists among us concerning the best way to train children for their place in society . Because [ p599 ] of these differences and because of reluctance to permit a single , iron - cast system of education to be imposed upon a nation compounded of so many strains , we have held that , even though public education is one of our most cherished democratic institutions , the Bill of Rights bars a state from compelling all children to attend the public schools . Pierce v. Society of Sisters , 268 U.S. 510 . But it is a very different thing for this Court to exercise censorship over the conviction of legislatures that a particular program or exercise will best promote in the minds of children who attend the common schools an attachment to the institutions of their country .	@@empty@@	unmatched
What the school authorities are really asserting is the right to awaken in the child 's mind considerations as to the significance of the flag contrary to those implanted by the parent . In such an attempt , the state is normally at a disadvantage in competing with the parent 's authority , so long -- and this is the vital aspect of religious toleration -- as parents are unmolested in their right to counteract by their own persuasiveness the wisdom and rightness of those loyalties which the state 's educational system is seeking to promote . Except where the transgression of constitutional liberty is too plain for argument , personal freedom is best maintained -- so long as the remedial channels of the democratic process remain open and unobstructed [ n6 ] -- when it is ingrained in a people 's habits , and not enforced against popular policy by the coercion of adjudicated law . That the flag salute is an allowable portion of a school program for those who do not invoke conscientious scruples is surely not debatable . But for us to insist that , though the ceremony may be required , exceptional immunity must be [ p600 ] given to dissidents , is to maintain that there is no basis for a legislative judgment that such an exemption might introduce elements of difficulty into the school discipline , might cast doubts in the minds of the other children which would themselves weaken the effect of the exercise .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The preciousness of the family relation , the authority and independence which give dignity to parenthood , indeed the enjoyment of all freedom , presuppose the kind of ordered society which is summarized by our flag . A society which is dedicated to the preservation of these ultimate values of civilization may , in self - protection , utilize the educational process for inculcating those almost unconscious feelings which bind men together in a comprehending loyalty , whatever may be their lesser differences and difficulties . That is to say , the process may be utilized so long as men 's right to believe as they please , to win others to their way of belief , and their right to assemble in their chosen places of worship for the devotional ceremonies of their faith , are all fully respected .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Judicial review , itself a limitation on popular government , is a fundamental part of our constitutional scheme . But to the legislature no less than to courts is committed the guardianship of deeply cherished liberties . See Missouri , K. & T. Ry . Co. v. May , 194 U.S. 267 , 270 . Where all the effective means of inducing political changes are left free from interference , education in the abandonment of foolish legislation is itself a training in liberty . To fight out the wise use of legislative authority in the forum of public opinion and before legislative assemblies , rather than to transfer such a contest to the judicial arena , serves to vindicate the self - confidence of a free people .

MR . JUSTICE STONE , dissenting :	@@empty@@	unmatched
I think the judgment below should be affirmed .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Two youths , now fifteen and sixteen years of age , are by the judgment of this Court held liable to expulsion from the public schools and to denial of all publicly supported educational privileges because of their refusal to yield to the compulsion of a law which commands their participation in a school ceremony contrary to their religious convictions . They and their father are citizens , and have not exhibited by any action or statement of opinion , any disloyalty to the Government of the United States . They are ready and willing to obey all its laws which do not conflict with what they sincerely believe to be the higher commandments of God . It is not doubted that these convictions are religious , that they are genuine , or that the refusal to yield to the compulsion of the law is in good faith , and with all sincerity . It would be a denial of their faith , as well as the teachings of most religions , to say that children of their age could not have religious convictions .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The law which is thus sustained is unique in the history of Anglo - American legislation . It does more than suppress freedom of speech , and more than prohibit the free exercise of religion , which concededly are forbidden by the First Amendment and are violations of the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth . For , by this law , the state seeks to coerce these children to express a sentiment which , as they interpret it , they do not entertain , and which violates their deepest religious convictions . It is not denied that such compulsion is a prohibited infringement of personal liberty , freedom of speech and religion , guaranteed by the Bill of Rights , except insofar as it may be justified and supported as a proper exercise of the state 's power over public education . Since the state , [ p602 ] in competition with parents , may , through teaching in the public schools , indoctrinate the minds of the young , it is said that , in aid of its undertaking to inspire loyalty and devotion to constituted authority and the flag which symbolizes it , it may coerce the pupil to make affirmation contrary to his belief and in violation of his religious faith . And , finally , it is said that , since the Minersville School Board and others are of the opinion that the country will be better served by conformity than by the observance of religious liberty which the Constitution prescribes , the courts are not free to pass judgment on the Board 's choice .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Concededly the constitutional guaranties of personal liberty are not always absolutes . Government has a right to survive and powers conferred upon it are not necessarily set at naught by the express prohibitions of the Bill of Rights . It may make war and raise armies . To that end , it may compel citizens to give military service , Selective Draft Law Cases , 245 U.S. 366 , and subject them to military training despite their religious objections . Hamilton v. Regents , 293 U.S. 245 . It may suppress religious practices dangerous to morals , and presumably those also which are inimical to public safety , health and good order . Davis v. Beason , 133 U.S. 333 . But it is a long step , and one which I am unable to take , to the position that government may , as a supposed educational measure and as a means of disciplining the young , compel public affirmations which violate their religious conscience .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The very fact that we have constitutional guaranties of civil liberties and the specificity of their command where freedom of speech and of religion are concerned require some accommodation of the powers which government normally exercises , when no question of civil liberty is involved , to the constitutional demand that those liberties be protected against the action of government [ p603 ] itself . The state concededly has power to require and control the education of its citizens , but it can not , by a general law compelling attendance at public schools , preclude attendance at a private school adequate in its instruction where the parent seeks to secure for the child the benefits of religious instruction not provided by the public school . Pierce v. Society of Sisters , 268 U.S. 510 . And only recently we have held that the state 's authority to control its public streets by generally applicable regulations is not an absolute to which free speech must yield , and can not be made the medium of its suppression , Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization , 307 U.S. 496 , 514 , et seq . , any more than can its authority to penalize littering of the streets by a general law be used to suppress the distribution of handbills as a means of communicating ideas to their recipients . Schneider v. State , 308 U.S. 147 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In these cases , it was pointed out that , where there are competing demands of the interests of government and of liberty under the Constitution , and where the performance of governmental functions is brought into conflict with specific constitutional restrictions , there must , when that is possible , be reasonable accommodation between them so as to preserve the essentials of both , and that it is the function of courts to determine whether such accommodation is reasonably possible . In the cases just mentioned , the Court was of opinion that there were ways enough to secure the legitimate state end without infringing the asserted immunity , or that the inconvenience caused by the inability to secure that end satisfactorily through other means , did not outweigh freedom of speech or religion . So here , even if we believe that such compulsions will contribute to national unity , there are other ways to teach loyalty and patriotism , which are the sources of national unity , than by compelling the pupil to affirm that which he does not believe , and by [ p604 ] commanding a form of affirmance which violates his religious convictions . Without recourse to such compulsion , the state is free to compel attendance at school and require teaching by instruction and study of all in our history and in the structure and organization of our government , including the guaranties of civil liberty which tend to inspire patriotism and love of country . I can not say that government here is deprived of any interest or function which it is entitled to maintain at the expense of the protection of civil liberties by requiring it to resort to the alternatives which do not coerce an affirmation of belief .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The guaranties of civil liberty are but guaranties of freedom of the human mind and spirit and of reasonable freedom and opportunity to express them . They presuppose the right of the individual to hold such opinions as he will and to give them reasonably free expression , and his freedom , and that of the state as well , to teach and persuade others by the communication of ideas . The very essence of the liberty which they guaranty is the freedom of the individual from compulsion as to what he shall think and what he shall say , at least where the compulsion is to bear false witness to his religion . If these guaranties are to have any meaning , they must , I think , be deemed to withhold from the state any authority to compel belief or the expression of it where that expression violates religious convictions , whatever may be the legislative view of the desirability of such compulsion .	@@empty@@	unmatched
History teaches us that there have been but few infringements of personal liberty by the state which have not been justified , as they are here , in the name of righteousness and the public good , and few which have not been directed , as they are now , at politically helpless minorities . The framers were not unaware that , under the system which they created , most governmental curtailments [ p605 ] of personal liberty would have the support of a legislative judgment that the public interest would be better served by its curtailment than by its constitutional protection . I can not conceive that , in prescribing , as limitations upon the powers of government , the freedom of the mind and spirit secured by the explicit guaranties of freedom of speech and religion , they intended or rightly could have left any latitude for a legislative judgment that the compulsory expression of belief which violates religious convictions would better serve the public interest than their protection . The Constitution may well elicit expressions of loyalty to it and to the government which it created , but it does not command such expressions or otherwise give any indication that compulsory expressions of loyalty play any such part in our scheme of government as to override the constitutional protection of freedom of speech and religion . And while such expressions of loyalty , when voluntarily given , may promote national unity , it is quite another matter to say that their compulsory expression by children in violation of their own and their parents ' religious convictions can be regarded as playing so important a part in our national unity as to leave school boards free to exact it despite the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion . The very terms of the Bill of Rights preclude , it seems to me , any reconciliation of such compulsions with the constitutional guaranties by a legislative declaration that they are more important to the public welfare than the Bill of Rights .	@@empty@@	unmatched
But even if this view be rejected and it is considered that there is some scope for the determination by legislatures whether the citizen shall be compelled to give public expression of such sentiments contrary to his religion , I am not persuaded that we should refrain from passing upon the legislative judgment " as long as the remedial [ p606 ] channels of the democratic process remain open and unobstructed . " This seems to me no less than the surrender of the constitutional protection of the liberty of small minorities to the popular will . We have previously pointed to the importance of a searching judicial inquiry into the legislative judgment in situations where prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may tend to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied on to protect minorities . See United States v. Carolene Products Co. , 304 U.S. 144 , 152 , note 4 . And , until now , we have not hesitated similarly to scrutinize legislation restricting the civil liberty of racial and religious minorities although no political process was affected . Meyer v. Nebraska , 262 U.S. 390 ; Pierce v. Society of Sisters , supra ; Farrington v. Tokushige , 273 U.S. 284 . Here we have such a small minority entertaining in good faith a religious belief , which is such a departure from the usual course of human conduct , that most persons are disposed to regard it with little toleration or concern . In such circumstances , careful scrutiny of legislative efforts to secure conformity of belief and opinion by a compulsory affirmation of the desired belief , is especially needful if civil rights are to receive any protection . Tested by this standard , I am not prepared to say that the right of this small and helpless minority , including children having a strong religious conviction , whether they understand its nature or not , to refrain from an expression obnoxious to their religion , is to be overborne by the interest of the state in maintaining discipline in the schools .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The Constitution expresses more than the conviction of the people that democratic processes must be preserved at all costs . It is also an expression of faith and a command that freedom of mind and spirit must be preserved , which government must obey if it is to adhere to that justice and moderation without which no free government can exist . [ p607 ] For this reason , it would seem that legislation which operates to repress the religious freedom of small minorities , which is admittedly within the scope of the protection of the Bill of Rights , must at least be subject to the same judicial scrutiny as legislation which we have recently held to infringe the constitutional liberty of religious and racial minorities .	@@empty@@	unmatched
With such scrutiny I can not say that the inconveniences which may attend some sensible adjustment of school discipline in order that the religious convictions of these children may be spared presents a problem so momentous or pressing as to outweigh the freedom from compulsory violation of religious faith which has been thought worthy of constitutional protection .	@@empty@@	unmatched

We think that appellants have standing to raise the constitutional rights of the married people with whom they had a professional relationship . Tileston v.

In that situation , we thought that the requirements of standing should be strict , lest the standards of " case or controversy " in Article III of the Constitution become blurred . Here , those doubts are removed by reason of a criminal conviction for serving married couples in violation of an aiding - and - abetting statute . Certainly the accessory should have standing to assert that the offense which he is charged with assisting is not , or can not constitutionally be , a crime .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This case is more akin to Truax v. Raich , 239 U.S. 33 , where an employee was permitted to assert the rights of his employer ; to Pierce v.

The association of people is not mentioned in the Constitution nor in the Bill of Rights .

By Pierce v. Society of Sisters , supra , the right to educate one 's children as one chooses is made applicable to the States by the force of the First and Fourteenth Amendments . By Meyer v. Nebraska , supra , the same dignity is given the right to study the German language in a private school . In other words , the State may not , consistently with the spirit of the First Amendment , contract the spectrum of available knowledge . The right of freedom of speech and press includes not only the right to utter or to print , but the right to distribute , the right to receive , the right to read ( Martin v. Struthers , 319 U.S. 141 , 143 ) and freedom of inquiry , freedom of thought , and freedom to teach ( see Wiemann v. Updegraff , 344 U.S. 183 , 195 ) -- indeed , the freedom of the entire university community . Sweezy v. New Hampshire , 354 U.S. 234 , 249 - 250 , 261 - 263 ; Barenblatt v.

Those cases involved more than the " right of assembly " -- a right that extends to all , irrespective of their race or ideology . De Jonge v. Oregon , 299 U.S. 353 . The right of " association , " like the right of belief ( Board of Education v. Barnette , 319 U.S. 624 ) , is more than the right to attend a meeting ; it includes the right to express one 's attitudes or philosophies by membership in a group or by affiliation with it or by other lawful means . Association in that context is a form of expression of opinion , and , while it is not expressly included in the First Amendment , its existence is necessary in making the express guarantees fully meaningful .

The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one , as we have seen . The Third Amendment , in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers " in any house " in time of peace without the consent of the owner , is another facet of that privacy . The Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the " right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures . " The Fifth Amendment , in its Self - Incrimination Clause , enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which government may not force him to surrender to his detriment .

The Ninth Amendment reads , " The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people .

To hold that a right so basic and fundamental and so deep - rooted in our society as the right of privacy in marriage may be infringed because that right is not guaranteed in so many words by the first eight amendments to the Constitution is to ignore the Ninth Amendment , and to give it no effect whatsoever . Moreover , a judicial construction that this fundamental right is not protected by the Constitution because it is not mentioned in explicit terms by one of the first eight amendments or elsewhere in the Constitution would violate the Ninth Amendment , which specifically states that [ p492 ] " [ t]he enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people .

A dissenting opinion suggests that my interpretation of the Ninth Amendment somehow " broaden[s ] the powers of this Court . " Post at 520 . With all due respect , I believe that it misses the import of what I am saying . I do not take the position of my Brother BLACK in his dissent in Adamson v. California , 332 U.S. 46 , 68 , that the entire Bill of Rights is incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment , and I do not mean to imply that the Ninth Amendment is applied against the States by the Fourteenth . Nor do I mean to state that the Ninth Amendment constitutes an independent source of rights protected from infringement by either the States or the Federal Government . Rather , the Ninth Amendment shows a belief of the Constitution 's authors that fundamental rights exist that are not expressly enumerated in the first eight amendments , and an intent that the list of rights included there not be deemed exhaustive . As any student of this Court 's opinions knows , this Court has held , often unanimously , that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect certain fundamental personal liberties from abridgment by the Federal Government or the States . See , e.g. , Bolling v. Sharpe , 347 U.S. 497 ; Aptheker v. Secretary of State , 378 U.S. 500 ; Kent v. Dulles , 357 U.S. 116 , Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310 U.S. 296 ; NAACP v. Alabama , 357 U.S. 449 ; Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U.S. 335 ; New York Times Co. v. Sullivan , 376 U.S. 254 . The Ninth Amendment simply shows the intent of the Constitution 's authors that other fundamental personal rights should not be denied such protection or disparaged in any other way simply because they are not specifically listed in the first eight constitutional amendments . I do not see how this broadens the authority [ p493 ] of the Court ; rather it serves to support what this Court has been doing in protecting fundamental rights .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Nor am I turning somersaults with history in arguing that the Ninth Amendment is relevant in a case dealing with a State 's infringement of a fundamental right . While the Ninth Amendment -- and indeed the entire Bill of Rights -- originally concerned restrictions upon federal power , the subsequently enacted Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the States as well from abridging fundamental personal liberties . And the Ninth Amendment , in indicating that not all such liberties are specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments , is surely relevant in showing the existence of other fundamental personal rights , now protected from state , as well as federal , infringement . In sum , the Ninth Amendment simply lends strong support to the view that the " liberty " protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments from infringement by the Federal Government or the States is not restricted to rights specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments .

The logic of the dissents would sanction federal or state legislation that seems to me even more plainly unconstitutional than the statute before us . Surely the Government , absent a showing of a compelling subordinating state interest , could not decree that all husbands and wives must be sterilized after two children have been born [ p497 ] to them . Yet , by their reasoning , such an invasion of marital privacy would not be subject to constitutional challenge , because , while it might be " silly , " no provision of the Constitution specifically prevents the Government from curtailing the marital right to bear children and raise a family . While it may shock some of my Brethren that the Court today holds that the Constitution protects the right of marital privacy , in my view , it is far more shocking to believe that the personal liberty guaranteed by the Constitution does not include protection against such totalitarian limitation of family size , which is at complete variance with our constitutional concepts . Yet if , upon a showing of a slender basis of rationality , a law outlawing voluntary birth control by married persons is valid , then , by the same reasoning , a law requiring compulsory birth control also would seem to be valid . In my view , however , both types of law would unjustifiably intrude upon rights of marital privacy which are constitutionally protected .	@@empty@@	unmatched

Although the Connecticut birth control law obviously encroaches upon a fundamental personal liberty , the State does not show that the law serves any " subordinating [ state ] interest which is compelling , " or that it is " necessary [ p498 ] . . . to the accomplishment of a permissible state policy . " The State , at most , argues that there is some rational relation between this statute and what is admittedly a legitimate subject of state concern -- the discouraging of extramarital relations . It says that preventing the use of birth control devices by married persons helps prevent the indulgence by some in such extramarital relations . The rationality of this justification is dubious , particularly in light of the admitted widespread availability to all persons in the State of Connecticut . unmarried as well as married , of birth control devices for the prevention of disease , as distinguished from the prevention of conception , see Tileston v. Ullman , 129 Conn. 84 , 26 A.2d 582 . But , in any event , it is clear that the state interest in safeguarding marital fidelity can be served by a more discriminately tailored statute which does not , like the present one , sweep unnecessarily broadly , reaching far beyond the evil sought to be dealt with and intruding upon the privacy of all married couples . See Aptheker v. Secretary of State , 378 U.S. 500 , 514 ; NAACP v. Alabama , 377 U.S. 288 , 307 - 308 ; McLaughlin v. Florida , supra , at 196 . Here , as elsewhere , " [ p]recision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms . " NAACP v. Button , 371 U.S. 415 , 438 . The State of Connecticut does have statutes , the constitutionality of which is beyond doubt , which prohibit adultery and fornication . See Conn . Gen . Stat . § § 53 - 218 , 53 - 219 et seq .

Post at 530 . He would require a more explicit guarantee than the one which the Court derives from several constitutional amendments . This Court , however , has never held that the Bill of Rights or the Fourteenth Amendment protects only those rights that the Constitution specifically mentions by name . See , e.g. , Bolling v.

I fully agree with the judgment of reversal , but find myself unable to join the Court 's opinion . The reason is that it seems to me to evince an approach to this case very much like that taken by my Brothers BLACK and STEWART in dissent , namely : the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not touch this Connecticut statute unless the enactment is found to violate some right assured by the letter or penumbra of the Bill of Rights . [ p500 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
In other words , what I find implicit in the Court 's opinion is that the " incorporation " doctrine may be used to restrict the reach of Fourteenth Amendment Due Process . For me , this is just as unacceptable constitutional doctrine as is the use of the " incorporation " approach to impose upon the States all the requirements of the Bill of Rights as found in the provisions of the first eight amendments and in the decisions of this Court interpreting them . See , e.g. , my concurring opinions in Pointer v. Texas , 380 U.S. 400 , 408 , and Griffin v. California , 380 U.S. 609 , 615 , and my dissenting opinion in Poe v.

In my view , the proper constitutional inquiry in this case is whether this Connecticut statute infringes the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the enactment violates basic values " implicit in the concept of ordered liberty , " Palko v. Connecticut , 302 U.S. 319 , 325 . For reasons stated at length in my dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman , supra , I believe that it does . While the relevant inquiry may be aided by resort to one or more of the provisions of the Bill of Rights , it is not dependent on them or any of their radiations . The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment stands , in my opinion , on its own bottom .	@@empty@@	unmatched
A further observation seems in order respecting the justification of my Brothers BLACK and STEWART for their " incorporation " approach to this case . Their approach does not rest on historical reasons , which are , of course , wholly lacking ( see Fairman , Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of Rights ? The Original Understanding , 2 Stan . L.Rev . 5 ( 1949 ) ) , but on the thesis that , by limiting the content of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the protection of rights which can be found elsewhere in the Constitution , in this instance , in the Bill of Rights , judges will thus be confined to " interpretation " of specific constitutional [ p501 ] provisions , and will thereby be restrained from introducing their own notions of constitutional right and wrong into the " vague contours of the Due Process Clause . " Rochin v. California , 342 U.S. 165 , 170 . While I could not more heartily agree that judicial " self - restraint " is an indispensable ingredient of sound constitutional adjudication , I do submit that the formula suggested for achieving it is more hollow than real . " Specific " provisions of the Constitution , no less than " due process , " lend themselves as readily to " personal " interpretations by judges whose constitutional outlook is simply to keep the Constitution in supposed " tune with the times " ( post , p. 522 ) . Need one go further than to recall last Term 's reapportionment cases , Wesberry v. Sanders , 376 U.S. 1 , and Reynolds v. Sims , 377 U.S. 533 , where a majority of the Court " interpreted " " by the People " ( Art . I , § 2 ) and " equal protection " ( Amdt . 14 ) to command " one person , one vote , " an interpretation that was made in the face of irrefutable and still unanswered history to the contrary ? See my dissenting opinions in those cases , 376 U.S. at 20 ; 377 U.S. at 589 .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Judicial self - restraint will not , I suggest , be brought about in the " due process " area by the historically unfounded incorporation formula long advanced by my Brother BLACK , and now in part espoused by my Brother STEWART . It will be achieved in this area , as in other constitutional areas , only by continual insistence upon respect for the teachings of history , solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society , and wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms . See Adamson v. California , 332 U.S. 46 , 59 ( Mr. Justice Frankfurter , concurring ) . Adherence to these principles will not , of course , obviate all constitutional differences of opinion among judges , nor should it . Their continued recognition [ p502 ] will , however , go farther toward keeping most judges from roaming at large in the constitutional field than will the interpolation into the Constitution of an artificial and largely illusory restriction on the content of the Due Process Clause .

The Connecticut anti - contraceptive statute deals rather substantially with this relationship .

Tileston v. Ullman , 129 Conn. 84 , 26 A.2d 582 . And the clear effect of these statutes , as enforced , is to deny disadvantaged citizens of Connecticut , those without either adequate knowledge or resources to obtain private counseling , access to medical assistance and up - to - date information in respect to proper methods of birth control . State v. Nelson , 126 Conn. 412 , 11 A.2d 856 ; State v. Griswold , 151 Conn. 544 , 200 A.2d 479 .

There is no serious contention that Connecticut thinks the use of artificial or external methods of contraception immoral or unwise in itself , or that the anti - use statute is founded upon any policy of promoting population expansion . Rather , the statute is said to serve the State 's policy against all forms of promiscuous or illicit sexual relationships , be they premarital or extramarital , concededly a permissible and legitimate legislative goal .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Without taking issue with the premise that the fear of conception operates as a deterrent to such relationships in addition to the criminal proscriptions Connecticut has against such conduct , I wholly fail to see how the ban on the use of contraceptives by married couples in any way reinforces the State 's ban on illicit sexual relationships . See Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners , 353 U.S. 232 , 239 . Connecticut does not bar the importation or possession of contraceptive devices ; they are not considered contraband material under state law , State v. Certain Contraceptive Materials , 126 Conn. 428 , 11 A.2d 863 , and their availability in that State is not seriously disputed . The only way Connecticut seeks to limit or control the availability of such devices is through its general aiding and abetting statute , whose operation in this context has [ p506 ] been quite obviously ineffective , and whose most serious use has been against birth control clinics rendering advice to married , rather than unmarried , persons . Cf . Yick Wo v. Hopkins , 118 U.S. 356 . Indeed , after over 80 years of the State 's proscription of use , the legality of the sale of such devices to prevent disease has never been expressly passed upon , although it appears that sales have long occurred and have only infrequently been challenged . This " undeviating policy . . . throughout all the long years . . . bespeaks more than prosecutorial paralysis . " Poe v. Ullman , 367 U.S. 497 , 502 . Moreover , it would appear that the sale of contraceptives to prevent disease is plainly legal under Connecticut law .	@@empty@@	unmatched
In these circumstances , one is rather hard pressed to explain how the ban on use by married persons in any way prevents use of such devices by persons engaging in illicit sexual relations , and thereby contributes to the State 's policy against such relationships . Neither the state courts nor the State before the bar of this Court has tendered such an explanation . It is purely fanciful to believe that the broad proscription on use facilitates discovery of use by persons engaging in a prohibited relationship , or for some other reason makes such use more unlikely , and thus can be supported by any sort of administrative consideration . Perhaps the theory is that the flat ban on use prevents married people from possessing contraceptives and , without the ready availability of such devices for use in the marital relationship , there will be no or less temptation to use them in extramarital ones . This reasoning rests on the premise that married people will comply with the ban in regard to their marital relationship , notwithstanding total nonenforcement in this context and apparent nonenforcibility , but will not comply with criminal statutes prohibiting extramarital affairs and the anti - use statute in respect to illicit sexual relationships , a premise whose validity has not been [ p507 ] demonstrated and whose intrinsic validity is not very evident . At most , the broad ban is of marginal utility to the declared objective . A statute limiting its prohibition on use to persons engaging in the prohibited relationship would serve the end posited by Connecticut in the same way , and with the same effectiveness or ineffectiveness , as the broad anti - use statute under attack in this case . I find nothing in this record justifying the sweeping scope of this statute , with its telling effect on the freedoms of married persons , and therefore conclude that it deprives such persons of liberty without due process of law .	@@empty@@	unmatched

I agree with my Brother STEWART 's dissenting opinion . And , like him , I do not to any extent whatever base my view that this Connecticut law is constitutional on a belief that the law is wise , or that its policy is a good one . In order that there may be no room at all to doubt why I vote as I do , I feel constrained to add that the law is every bit as offensive to me as it is to my Brethren of the majority and my Brothers HARLAN , WHITE and GOLDBERG , who , reciting reasons why it is offensive to them , hold it unconstitutional . There is no single one of the graphic and eloquent strictures and criticisms fired at the policy of this Connecticut law either by the Court 's opinion or by those of my concurring Brethren to which I can not subscribe -- except their conclusion that the evil qualities they see in the law make it unconstitutional .	@@empty@@	unmatched
Had the doctor defendant here , or even the nondoctor defendant , been convicted for doing nothing more than expressing opinions to persons coming to the clinic that certain contraceptive devices , medicines or practices would do them good and would be desirable , or for telling people how devices could be used , I can think of no reasons at this time why their expressions of views would not be [ p508 ] protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments , which guarantee freedom of speech . Cf . Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel . Virginia State Bar , 377 U.S. 1 ; NAACP v. Button , 371 U.S. 415 . But speech is one thing ; conduct and physical activities are quite another . See , e.g. , Cox v. Louisiana , 379 U.S. 536 , 554 - 555 ; Cox v. Louisiana , 379 U.S. 559 , 563 - 564 ; i d . 575 - 584 ( concurring opinion ) ; Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co. , 336 U.S. 490 ; cf . Reynolds v. United States , 98 U.S. 145 , 163 - 164 . The two defendants here were active participants in an organization which gave physical examinations to women , advised them what kind of contraceptive devices or medicines would most likely be satisfactory for them , and then supplied the devices themselves , all for a graduated scale of fees , based on the family income . Thus , these defendants admittedly engaged with others in a planned course of conduct to help people violate the Connecticut law . Merely because some speech was used in carrying on that conduct -- just as , in ordinary life , some speech accompanies most kinds of conduct -- we are not , in my view , justified in holding that the First Amendment forbids the State to punish their conduct . Strongly as I desire to protect all First Amendment freedoms , I am unable to stretch the Amendment so as to afford protection to the conduct of these defendants in violating the Connecticut law . What would be the constitutional fate of the law if hereafter applied to punish nothing but speech is , as I have said , quite another matter . The Court talks about a constitutional " right of privacy " as though there is some constitutional provision or provisions forbidding any law ever to be passed which might abridge the " privacy " of individuals . But there is not . There are , of course , guarantees in certain specific constitutional provisions which are designed in part to protect privacy at certain times and places with respect to certain activities . Such , for example , is the Fourth [ p509 ] Amendment 's guarantee against " unreasonable searches and seizures . " But I think it belittles that Amendment to talk about it as though it protects nothing but " privacy . " To treat it that way is to give it a niggardly interpretation , not the kind of liberal reading I think any Bill of Rights provision should be given . The average man would very likely not have his feelings soothed any more by having his property seized openly than by having it seized privately and by stealth . He simply wants his property left alone . And a person can be just as much , if not more , irritated , annoyed and injured by an unceremonious public arrest by a policeman as he is by a seizure in the privacy of his office or home .	@@empty@@	unmatched
One of the most effective ways of diluting or expanding a constitutionally guaranteed right is to substitute for the crucial word or words of a constitutional guarantee another word or words , more or less flexible and more or less restricted in meaning . This fact is well illustrated by the use of the term " right of privacy " as a comprehensive substitute for the Fourth Amendment 's guarantee against " unreasonable searches and seizures . " " Privacy " is a broad , abstract and ambiguous concept which can easily be shrunken in meaning but which can also , on the other hand , easily be interpreted as a constitutional ban against many things other than searches and seizures . I have expressed the view many times that First Amendment freedoms , for example , have suffered from a failure of the courts to stick to the simple language of the First Amendment in construing it , instead of invoking multitudes of words substituted for those the Framers used . See , e.g. , New York Times Co. v. Sullivan , 376 U.S. 254 , 293 ( concurring opinion ) ; cases collected in City of El Paso v. Simmons , 379 U.S. 497 , 517 , n. 1 ( dissenting opinion ) ; Black , The Bill of Rights , 35 N.Y.U.L.Rev . 865 . For these reasons , I get nowhere in this case by talk about a constitutional " right of privacy " as an emanation from [ p510 ] one or more constitutional provisions . [ n1 ] I like my privacy as well as the next one , but I am nevertheless compelled to admit that government has a right to . invade it unless prohibited by some specific constitutional provision . For these reasons , I can not agree with the Court 's judgment and the reasons it gives for holding this Connecticut law unconstitutional .	@@empty@@	unmatched
This brings me to the arguments made by my Brothers HARLAN , WHITE and GOLDBERG for invalidating the Connecticut law . Brothers HARLAN [ n2 ] and WHITE would invalidate it by reliance on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment , but Brother GOLDBERG , while agreeing with Brother HARLAN , relies also on the Ninth Amendment . I have no doubt that the Connecticut law could be applied in such a way as to abridge freedom of [ p511 ] speech and press , and therefore violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments . My disagreement with the Court 's opinion holding that there is such a violation here is a narrow one , relating to the application of the First Amendment to the facts and circumstances of this particular case . But my disagreement with Brothers HARLAN , WHITE and GOLDBERG is more basic . I think that , if properly construed , neither the Due Process Clause nor the Ninth Amendment , nor both together , could under any circumstances be a proper basis for invalidating the Connecticut law . I discuss the due process and Ninth Amendment arguments together because , on analysis , they turn out to be the same thing -- merely using different words to claim for this Court and the federal judiciary power to invalidate any legislative act which the judges find irrational , unreasonable or offensive .	@@empty@@	unmatched
The due process argument which my Brothers HARLAN and WHITE adopt here is based , as their opinions indicate , on the premise that this Court is vested with power to invalidate all state laws that it considers to be arbitrary , capricious , unreasonable , or oppressive , or on this Court 's belief that a particular state law under scrutiny has no " rational or justifying " purpose , or is offensive to a " sense of fairness and justice . " [ n3 ] If these formulas based on " natural justice , " or others which mean the same thing , [ n4 ] are to prevail , they require judges to determine [ p512 ] what is or is not constitutional on the basis of their own appraisal of what laws are unwise or unnecessary . The power to make such decisions is , of course , that of a legislative body . Surely it has to be admitted that no provision of the Constitution specifically gives such blanket power to courts to exercise such a supervisory veto over the wisdom and value of legislative policies and to hold unconstitutional those laws which they believe unwise or dangerous . I readily admit that no legislative body , state or national , should pass laws that can justly be given any [ p513 ] of the invidious labels invoked as constitutional excuses to strike down state laws . But perhaps it is not too much to say that no legislative body ever does pass laws without believing that they will accomplish a sane , rational , wise and justifiable purpose . While I completely subscribe to the holding of Marbury v. Madison , 1 Cranch 137 , and subsequent cases , that our Court has constitutional power to strike down statutes , state or federal , that violate commands of the Federal Constitution , I do not believe that we are granted power by the Due Process Clause or any other constitutional provision or provisions to measure constitutionality by our belief that legislation is arbitrary , capricious or unreasonable , or accomplishes no justifiable purpose , or is offensive to our own notions of " civilized standards of conduct . " [ n5 ] Such an appraisal of the wisdom of legislation is an attribute of the power to make laws , not of the power to interpret them . The use by federal courts of such a formula or doctrine or whatnot to veto federal or state laws simply takes away from Congress and States the power to make laws based on their own judgment of fairness and wisdom , and transfers that power to this Court for ultimate determination -- a power which was specifically denied to federal courts by the convention that framed the Constitution . [ n6 ] [ p514 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
Of the cases on which my Brothers WHITE and GOLDBERG rely so heavily , undoubtedly the reasoning of two of them supports their result here -- as would that of a number of others which they do not bother to name , e.g. , [ p515 ] Lochner v. New York , 198 U.S. 45 , Coppage v. Kansas , 236 U.S. 1 , Jay Burns Baking Co. v. Bryan , 264 U.S. 504 , and Adkins v. Children 's Hospital , 261 U.S. 525 . The two they do cite and quote from , Meyer v. Nebraska , 262 U.S. 390 , and Pierce v. Society of Sisters , 268 U.S. 510 , were both decided in opinions by Mr. Justice McReynolds which elaborated the same natural law due process philosophy found in Lochner v. New York , supra , one of the cases on which he relied in Meyer , along with such other long - discrSyllabus & Opinions Onlys as , e.g. , Adams v. Tanner , 244 U.S. 590 , and Adkins v. Children 's Hospital , supra . Meyer held unconstitutional , as an " arbitrary " and unreasonable interference with the right of a teacher to carry on his occupation and of parents to hire him , a [ p516 ] state law forbidding the teaching of modern foreign languages to young children in the schools . [ n7 ] And in Pierce , relying principally on Meyer , Mr. Justice McReynolds said that a state law requiring that all children attend public schools interfered unconstitutionally with the property rights of private school corporations because it was an " arbitrary , unreasonable and unlawful interference " which threatened " destruction of their business and property . " 268 U.S. at 536 . Without expressing an opinion as to whether either of those cases reached a correct result in light of our later decisions applying the First Amendment to the States through the Fourteenth , [ n8 ] I merely point out that the reasoning stated in Meyer and Pierce was the same natural law due process philosophy which many later opinions repudiated , and which I can not accept . Brothers WHITE and GOLDBERG also cite other cases , such as NAACP v. Button , 371 U.S. 415 , Shelton v. Tucker , 364 U.S. 479 , and Schneider v. State , 308 U.S. 147 , which held that States in regulating conduct could not , consistently with the First Amendment as applied to them by the Fourteenth , pass unnecessarily broad laws which might indirectly infringe on First Amendment freedoms . [ n9 ] See Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel . [ p517 ] Virginia State Bar , 377 U.S. 1 , 7 - 8 . [ n10 ] Brothers WHITE and GOLDBERG now apparently would start from this requirement that laws be narrowly drafted so as not to curtail free speech and assembly , and extend it limitlessly to require States to justify any law restricting " liberty " as my Brethren define " liberty . " This would mean at the [ p518 ] very least , I suppose , that every state criminal statute -- since it must inevitably curtail " liberty " to some extent -- would be suspect , and would have to be Justified to this Court . [ n11 ]	@@empty@@	unmatched
My Brother GOLDBERG has adopted the recent discovery [ n12 ] that the Ninth Amendment as well as the Due Process Clause can be used by this Court as authority to strike down all state legislation which this Court thinks [ p519 ] violates " fundamental principles of liberty and justice , " or is contrary to the " traditions and [ collective ] conscience of our people . " He also states , without proof satisfactory to me , that , in making decisions on this basis , judges will not consider " their personal and private notions . " One may ask how they can avoid considering them . Our Court certainly has no machinery with which to take a Gallup Poll . [ n13 ] And the scientific miracles of this age have not yet produced a gadget which the Court can use to determine what traditions are rooted in the " [ collective ] conscience of our people . " Moreover , one would certainly have to look far beyond the language of the Ninth Amendment [ n14 ] to find that the Framers vested in this Court any such awesome veto powers over lawmaking , either by the States or by the Congress . Nor does anything in the history of the Amendment offer any support for such a shocking doctrine . The whole history of the adoption of the Constitution and Bill of Rights points the other way , and the very material quoted by my Brother GOLDBERG shows that the Ninth Amendment was intended to protect against the idea that , " by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power " to the Federal Government , " those rights which were not singled out were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government [ the United States ] , and were consequently [ p520 ] insecure . " [ n15 ] That Amendment was passed not to broaden the powers of this Court or any other department of " the General Government , " but , as every student of history knows , to assure the people that the Constitution in all its provisions was intended to limit the Federal Government to the powers granted expressly or by necessary implication . If any broad , unlimited power to hold laws unconstitutional because they offend what this Court conceives to be the " [ collective ] conscience of our people " is vested in this Court by the Ninth Amendment , the Fourteenth Amendment , or any other provision of the Constitution , it was not given by the Framers , but rather has been bestowed on the Court by the Court . This fact is perhaps responsible for the peculiar phenomenon that , for a period of a century and a half , no serious suggestion was ever made that the Ninth Amendment , enacted to protect state powers against federal invasion , could be used as a weapon of federal power to prevent state legislatures from passing laws they consider appropriate to govern local affairs . Use of any such broad , unbounded judicial authority would make of this Court 's members a day - to - day constitutional convention .	@@empty@@	unmatched
I repeat , so as not to be misunderstood , that this Court does have power , which it should exercise , to hold laws unconstitutional where they are forbidden by the Federal Constitution . My point is that there is no provision [ p521 ] of the Constitution which either expressly or impliedly vests power in this Court to sit as a supervisory agency over acts of duly constituted legislative bodies and set aside their laws because of the Court 's belief that the legislative policies adopted are unreasonable , unwise , arbitrary , capricious or irrational . The adoption of such a loose flexible . uncontrolled standard for holding laws unconstitutional , if ever it is finally achieved , will amount to a great unconstitutional shift of power to the courts which I believe and am constrained to say will be bad for the courts , and worse for the country . Subjecting federal and state laws to such an unrestrained and unrestrainable judicial control as to the wisdom of legislative enactments would , I fear , jeopardize the separation of governmental powers that the Framers set up , and , at the same time , threaten to take away much of the power of States to govern themselves which the Constitution plainly intended them to have .

I realize that many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written , sometimes in rhapsodical strains , about the duty of this Court to keep the Constitution in tune with the times . The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time , and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes . For myself , I must , with all deference , reject that philosophy . The Constitution makers knew the need for change , and provided for it . Amendments suggested by the people 's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification . That method of change was good for our Fathers , and , being somewhat old - fashioned , I must add it is good enough for me . And so I can not rely on the Due Process Clause or the Ninth Amendment or any mysterious and uncertain natural law concept as a reason for striking down this state law . The Due Process Clause , with an " arbitrary and capricious " or " shocking to the conscience " formula , was liberally used by this Court to strike down economic legislation in the early decades of this century , threatening , many people thought , the tranquility and stability of the Nation . See , e.g. , Lochner v. New York , 198 U.S. 45 . That formula , based on subjective considerations of " natural justice , " is no less dangerous when used to enforce this Court 's views about personal rights than those about economic rights . I had thought that we had laid that formula , as a means for striking down state legislation , to rest once and for all in cases like West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish , 300 U.S. 379 ; Olsen v. Nebraska ex rel . Western Reference & Bond Assn . , 313 U.S. 236 , and many other [ p523 ] opinions . [ n17 ] See also Lochner v.

Apparently my Brethren have less quarrel with state economic regulations than former Justices of their persuasion had .

Since 1879 , Connecticut has had on its books a law which forbids the use of contraceptives by anyone . I think this is an uncommonly silly law . As a practical matter , the law is obviously unenforceable , except in the oblique context of the present case . As a philosophical matter , I believe the use of contraceptives in the relationship of marriage should be left to personal and private choice , based upon each individual 's moral , ethical , and religious beliefs . As a matter of social policy , I think professional counsel about methods of birth control should be available to all , so that each individual 's choice can be meaningfully made . But we are not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise , or even asinine . We are asked to hold that it violates the United States Constitution .
