The California Reproductive Freedom , Accountability , Comprehensive Care , and Transparency Act ( FACT Act ) was enacted to regulate crisis pregnancy centers — pro - life centers that offer pregnancy - related services . The FACT Act requires clinics that primarily serve pregnant women to provide certain notices . Clinics that are licensed must notify women that California provides free or low - cost services , including abortions , and give them a phone number to call . Its stated purpose is to make sure that state residents know their rights and what health care services are available to them . Unlicensed clinics must notify women that California has not licensed the clinics to provide medical services . Its stated purpose is to ensure that pregnant women know when they are receiving health care from licensed professionals . Petitioners — two crisis pregnancy centers , one licensed and one unlicensed , and an organization of crisis pregnancy centers — filed suit . They alleged that both the licensed and the unlicensed notices abridge the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment . The District Court denied their motion for a preliminary injunction , and the Ninth Circuit affirmed . Holding that petitioners could not show a likelihood of success on the merits , the court concluded that the licensed notice survived a lower level of scrutiny applicable to regulations of “ professional speech , ” and that the unlicensed notice satisfied any level of scrutiny .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	1

Content - based regulations “ target speech based on its communicative content . ” Reed v. Town of Gilbert , 576 U. S. _ _ _ , _ _ _ ( 2015 ) ( slip op . , at 6 ) . As a general matter , such laws “ are presumptively unconstitutional and may be justified only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests . ” Ibid . This stringent standard reflects the fundamental principle that governments have “ ‘ no power to restrict expression because of its message , its ideas , its subject matter , or its content.’ ” Ibid . ( quoting Police Dept . of Chicago v. Mosley , 408 U. S. 92 , 95 ( 1972 ) ) .	The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0
In addition to disclosure requirements under Zauderer , this Court has upheld regulations of professional conduct that incidentally burden speech . “ [ T]he First Amendment does not prevent restrictions directed at commerce or conduct from imposing incidental burdens on speech , ” Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc. , 564 U. S. 552 , 567 ( 2011 ) , and professionals are no exception to this rule , see Ohralik , supra , at 456 . Longstanding torts for professional malpractice , for example , “ fall within the traditional purview of state regulation of professional conduct . ” NAACP v. Button , 371 U. S. 415 , 438 ( 1963 ) ; but cf . i d . , at 439 ( “ [ A ] State may not , under the guise of prohibiting professional misconduct , ignore constitutional rights ” ) . While drawing the line between speech and conduct can be difficult , this Court ’s precedents have long drawn it , see , e.g. , Sorrell , supra , at 567 ; Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co. , 336 U. S. 490 , 502 ( 1949 ) , and the line is “ ‘ long familiar to the bar,’ ” United States v. Stevens , 559 U. S. 460 , 468 ( 2010 ) ( quoting Simon & Schuster , Inc. v. Members of N. Y State Crime Victims Bd . , 502 U. S. 105 , 127 ( 1991 ) ( Kennedy , J. , concurring in judgment ) ) .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	1

In all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , and those in which a state shall be party , the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction . In all the other cases before mentioned , the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction , both as to law and fact , with such exceptions , and under such regulations as the Congress shall make . The trial of all crimes , except in cases of impeachment , shall be by jury ; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed ; but when not committed within any state , the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed .	0

Outside of the two contexts discussed above — disclosures under Zauderer and professional conduct — this Court ’s precedents have long protected the First Amendment rights of professionals .

Further , California could inform low - income women about its services “ without burdening a speaker with unwanted speech . ” Riley , 487 U. S. , at 800 . Most obvi - ously , it could inform the women itself with a public - information campaign . See ibid . ( concluding that a compelled disclosure was unconstitutional because the government could “ itself publish . . . the disclosure ” ) . Califor - nia could even post the information on public property near crisis pregnancy centers . California argues that it has already tried an advertising campaign , and that many women who are eligible for publicly - funded healthcare have not enrolled . But California has identified no evidence to that effect . And regardless , a “ tepid response ” does not prove that an advertising campaign is not a sufficient alternative . United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group , Inc. , 529 U. S. 803 , 816 ( 2000 ) . Here , for example , individuals might not have enrolled in California ’s services because they do not want them , or because California spent insufficient resources on the advertising campaign . Either way , California can not co - opt the licensed facilities to deliver its message for it . “ [ T]he First Amendment does not permit the State to sacrifice speech for efficiency . ” Riley , supra , at 795 ; accord , Arizona Free Enterprise Club ’s Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett , 564 U. S. 721 , 747 ( 2011 ) .

The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session .	0

The majority , at the end of Part II of its opinion , perhaps recognizing this problem , adds a general disclaimer . It says that it does not “ question the legality of health and safety warnings long considered permissible , or purely factual and uncontroversial disclosures about commercial products . ” Ante , at 16–17 . But this generally phrased disclaimer would seem more likely to invite litigation than to provide needed limitation and clarification . The major - ity , for example , does not explain why the Act here , which is justified in part by health and safety considerations , does not fall within its “ health ” category . Ante , at 14 ; see also Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey , 505 U. S. 833 , 882–884 ( 1992 ) ( joint opinion of O’Connor , Kennedy , and Souter , JJ . ) ( reasoning that disclosures related to fetal development and childbirth are related to the health of a woman seeking an abortion ) . Nor does the majority opinion offer any reasoned basis that might help apply its disclaimer for distinguishing lawful from unlawful disclosures . In the absence of a reasoned explanation of the disclaimer ’s meaning and rationale , the disclaimer is unlikely to withdraw the invitation to litigation that the majority ’s general broad “ content - based ” test issues . That test invites courts around the Nation to apply an unpredictable First Amendment to ordinary social and economic regulation , striking down disclosure laws that judges may disfavor , while upholding others , all without grounding their decisions in reasoned principle .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	1

Even during the Lochner era , when this Court struck down numerous economic regulations concerning industry , this Court was careful to defer to state legislative judgments concerning the medical profession . The Court took the view that a State may condition the practice of medicine on any number of requirements , and physicians , in exchange for following those reasonable requirements , could receive a license to practice medicine from the State . Medical professionals do not , generally speaking , have a right to use the Constitution as a weapon allowing them rigorously to control the content of those reasonable conditions .

Of course , one might take the majority ’s decision to mean that speech about abortion is special , that it involves in this case not only professional medical matters , but also views based on deeply held religious and moral beliefs about the nature of the practice . To that extent , arguably , the speech here is different from that at issue in Zauderer . But assuming that is so , the law ’s insistence upon treating like cases alike should lead us to reject the petitioners’ arguments that I have discussed . This insistence , the need for evenhandedness , should prove particularly weighty in a case involving abortion rights . That is because Americans hold strong , and differing , views about the matter . Some Americans believe that abortion involves the death of a live and innocent human being . Others believe that the ability to choose an abortion is “ central to personal dignity and autonomy , ” Casey , 505 U. S. , at 851 , and note that the failure to allow women to choose an abortion involves the deaths of innocent women . We have previously noted that we can not try to adjudicate who is right and who is wrong in this moral debate . But we can do our best to interpret American constitutional law so that it applies fairly within a Nation whose citizens strongly hold these different points of view . That is one reason why it is particularly important to interpret the First Amendment so that it applies evenhandedly as between those who disagree so strongly . For this reason too a Constitution that allows States to insist that medical providers tell women about the possibility of adoption should also allow States similarly to insist that medical providers tell women about the possibility of abortion .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	1

The majority does not question that the State ’s interest ( ensuring that “ pregnant women in California know when they are getting medical care from licensed professionals ” ) is the type of informational interest that Zauderer encompasses . Ante , at 5 , 17 . Nor could it . In Riley , 487 U.

Justice Stevens also appeals to the undoubted fact that some in the founding generation thought that the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment should have a narrower meaning , protecting only the Christian religion or perhaps only Protestantism . See Van Orden , ante , at 2022 . I am at a loss to see how this helps his case , except by providing a cloud of obfuscating smoke . ( Since most thought the Clause permitted government invocation of monotheism , and some others thought it permitted government invocation of Christianity , he proposes that it be construed not to permit any government invocation of religion at all . ) At any rate , those narrower views of the Establishment Clause were as clearly rejected as the more expansive ones . Washingtons First Thanksgiving Proclamation is merely an example .

Justice Stevens says that if one is serious about following the original understanding of the Establishment Clause , he must repudiate its incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment , and hold that it does not apply against the States .

Finally , I must respond to Justice Stevens  assertion that I would marginaliz[e ] the belief systems of more than 7 million Americans who adhere to religions that are not monotheistic . Van Orden , ante , at 1314 , n. 18 ( dissenting opinion ) . Surely that is a gross exaggeration . The beliefs of those citizens are entirely protected by the Free Exercise Clause , and by those aspects of the Establishment Clause that do not relate to government acknowledgment of the Creator . Invocation of God despite their beliefs is permitted not because nonmonotheistic religions cease to be religions recognized by the religion clauses of the First Amendment , but because governmental invocation of God is not an establishment . Justice Stevens fails to recognize that in the context of public acknowledgments of God there are legitimate competing interests : On the one hand , the interest of that minority in not feeling excluded ; but on the other , the interest of the overwhelming majority of religious believers in being able to give God thanks and supplication as a people , and with respect to our national endeavors . Our national tradition has resolved that conflict in favor of the majority . 8 It is not for this Court to change a disposition that accounts , many Americans think , for the phenomenon remarked upon in a quotation attributed to various authors , including Bismarck , but which I prefer to associate with Charles de Gaulle : God watches over little children , drunkards , and the United States of America.	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	1

If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law . But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays , and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively .

With all of this reality ( and much more ) staring it in the face , how can the Court possibly assert that  the First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between … religion and nonreligion,  ante , at 11 , and that [m]anifesting a purpose to favor . . . adherence to religion generally, ante , at 12 , is unconstitutional ? Who says so ? Surely not the words of the Constitution . Surely not the history and traditions that reflect our societys constant understanding of those words . Surely not even the current sense of our society , recently reflected in an Act of Congress adopted unanimously by the Senate and with only 5 nays in the House of Representatives , see 148 Cong . Rec . S6226 ( 2002 ) ; i d . , at H7186 , criticizing a Court of Appeals opinion that had held under God in the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional . See Act of Nov. 13 , 2002 , § § 1(9 ) , 2(a ) , 3(a ) , 116Stat . 2057 , 2058 , 20602061 ( reaffirming the Pledge of Allegiance and the National Motto ( In God We Trust ) and stating that the Pledge of Allegiance is clearly consistent with the text and intent of the Constitution ) . Nothing stands behind the Courts assertion that governmental affirmation of the societys belief in God is unconstitutional except the Courts own say - so , citing as support only the unsubstantiated say - so of earlier Courts going back no farther than the mid-20th century . See ante , at 11 , citing Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints v. Amos , 483 U. S. 327 , 335 ( 1987 ) , in turn citing Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.

S. 1 , 15 ( 1947 ) . 2 And it is , moreover , a thoroughly discredited say - so .

Justice Stevens also appeals to the undoubted fact that some in the founding generation thought that the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment should have a narrower meaning , protecting only the Christian religion or perhaps only Protestantism .

Justice Stevens says that if one is serious about following the original understanding of the Establishment Clause , he must repudiate its incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment , and hold that it does not apply against the States .

He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments .

Justice Stevens says that if one is serious about following the original understanding of the Establishment Clause , he must repudiate its incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment , and hold that it does not apply against the States . See Van Orden , ante , at 2426 ( dissenting opinion ) . This is more smoke . Justice Stevens did not feel that way last Term , when he joined an opinion insisting upon the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause , but nonetheless applying it against the State of Washington . See Crawford v. Washington , 541 U. S. 36 ( 2004 ) . The notion that incorporation empties the incorporated provisions of their original meaning has no support in either reason or precedent .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	0
Finally , I must respond to Justice Stevens  assertion that I would marginaliz[e ] the belief systems of more than 7 million Americans who adhere to religions that are not monotheistic . Van Orden , ante , at 1314 , n. 18 ( dissenting opinion ) . Surely that is a gross exaggeration . The beliefs of those citizens are entirely protected by the Free Exercise Clause , and by those aspects of the Establishment Clause that do not relate to government acknowledgment of the Creator . Invocation of God despite their beliefs is permitted not because nonmonotheistic religions cease to be religions recognized by the religion clauses of the First Amendment , but because governmental invocation of God is not an establishment . Justice Stevens fails to recognize that in the context of public acknowledgments of God there are legitimate competing interests : On the one hand , the interest of that minority in not feeling excluded ; but on the other , the interest of the overwhelming majority of religious believers in being able to give God thanks and supplication as a people , and with respect to our national endeavors . Our national tradition has resolved that conflict in favor of the majority . 8 It is not for this Court to change a disposition that accounts , many Americans think , for the phenomenon remarked upon in a quotation attributed to various authors , including Bismarck , but which I prefer to associate with Charles de Gaulle : God watches over little children , drunkards , and the United States of America.	The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state , or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state .	0

Justice Stevens also appeals to the undoubted fact that some in the founding generation thought that the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment should have a narrower meaning , protecting only the Christian religion or perhaps only Protestantism . See Van Orden , ante , at 2022 . I am at a loss to see how this helps his case , except by providing a cloud of obfuscating smoke . ( Since most thought the Clause permitted government invocation of monotheism , and some others thought it permitted government invocation of Christianity , he proposes that it be construed not to permit any government invocation of religion at all . ) At any rate , those narrower views of the Establishment Clause were as clearly rejected as the more expansive ones . Washingtons First Thanksgiving Proclamation is merely an example .

This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of the several states , as provided in the Constitution , within seven years from the date of the submission hereof to the states by the Congress .	0
Justice Stevens also appeals to the undoubted fact that some in the founding generation thought that the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment should have a narrower meaning , protecting only the Christian religion or perhaps only Protestantism . See Van Orden , ante , at 2022 . I am at a loss to see how this helps his case , except by providing a cloud of obfuscating smoke . ( Since most thought the Clause permitted government invocation of monotheism , and some others thought it permitted government invocation of Christianity , he proposes that it be construed not to permit any government invocation of religion at all . ) At any rate , those narrower views of the Establishment Clause were as clearly rejected as the more expansive ones . Washingtons First Thanksgiving Proclamation is merely an example . All of the actions of Washington and the First Congress upon which I have relied , virtually all Thanksgiving Proclamations throughout our history , 5 and all the other examples of our Governments favoring religion that I have cited , have invoked God , but not Jesus Christ . 6 Rather than relying upon Justice Stevens  assurance that [t]he original understanding of the type of religion that qualified for constitutional protection under the First amendment certainly did not include . . . followers of Judaism and Islam, Van Orden , ante , at 22 ; see also ante , at 3233 , I would prefer to take the word of George Washington , who , in his famous Letter to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport , Rhode Island , wrote that ,	The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes , from whatever source derived , without apportionment among the several states , and without regard to any census or enumeration .	0
Justice Stevens says that if one is serious about following the original understanding of the Establishment Clause , he must repudiate its incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment , and hold that it does not apply against the States . See Van Orden , ante , at 2426 ( dissenting opinion ) . This is more smoke . Justice Stevens did not feel that way last Term , when he joined an opinion insisting upon the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause , but nonetheless applying it against the State of Washington . See Crawford v. Washington , 541 U. S. 36 ( 2004 ) . The notion that incorporation empties the incorporated provisions of their original meaning has no support in either reason or precedent .

Finally , I must respond to Justice Stevens  assertion that I would marginaliz[e ] the belief systems of more than 7 million Americans who adhere to religions that are not monotheistic . Van Orden , ante , at 1314 , n. 18 ( dissenting opinion ) . Surely that is a gross exaggeration . The beliefs of those citizens are entirely protected by the Free Exercise Clause , and by those aspects of the Establishment Clause that do not relate to government acknowledgment of the Creator . Invocation of God despite their beliefs is permitted not because nonmonotheistic religions cease to be religions recognized by the religion clauses of the First Amendment , but because governmental invocation of God is not an establishment . Justice Stevens fails to recognize that in the context of public acknowledgments of God there are legitimate competing interests : On the one hand , the interest of that minority in not feeling excluded ; but on the other , the interest of the overwhelming majority of religious believers in being able to give God thanks and supplication as a people , and with respect to our national endeavors . Our national tradition has resolved that conflict in favor of the majority . 8 It is not for this Court to change a disposition that accounts , many Americans think , for the phenomenon remarked upon in a quotation attributed to various authors , including Bismarck , but which I prefer to associate with Charles de Gaulle : God watches over little children , drunkards , and the United States of America.	Each House shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members , and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business ; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day , and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members , in such manner , and under such penalties as each House may provide . Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings , punish its members for disorderly behavior , and , with the concurrence of two thirds , expel a member . Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings , and from time to time publish the same , excepting such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy ; and the yeas and nays of the members of either House on any question shall , at the desire of one fifth of those present , be entered on the journal . Neither House , during the session of Congress , shall , without the consent of the other , adjourn for more than three days , nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting .	0

With all of this reality ( and much more ) staring it in the face , how can the Court possibly assert that  the First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between … religion and nonreligion,  ante , at 11 , and that [m]anifesting a purpose to favor . . . adherence to religion generally, ante , at 12 , is unconstitutional ? Who says so ? Surely not the words of the Constitution . Surely not the history and traditions that reflect our societys constant understanding of those words . Surely not even the current sense of our society , recently reflected in an Act of Congress adopted unanimously by the Senate and with only 5 nays in the House of Representatives , see 148 Cong . Rec . S6226 ( 2002 ) ; i d . , at H7186 , criticizing a Court of Appeals opinion that had held under God in the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional .

Nothing stands behind the Courts assertion that governmental affirmation of the societys belief in God is unconstitutional except the Courts own say - so , citing as support only the unsubstantiated say - so of earlier Courts going back no farther than the mid-20th century .

With all of this reality ( and much more ) staring it in the face , how can the Court possibly assert that  the First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between … religion and nonreligion,  ante , at 11 , and that [m]anifesting a purpose to favor . . . adherence to religion generally, ante , at 12 , is unconstitutional ? Who says so ? Surely not the words of the Constitution . Surely not the history and traditions that reflect our societys constant understanding of those words . Surely not even the current sense of our society , recently reflected in an Act of Congress adopted unanimously by the Senate and with only 5 nays in the House of Representatives , see 148 Cong . Rec . S6226 ( 2002 ) ; i d . , at H7186 , criticizing a Court of Appeals opinion that had held under God in the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional . See Act of Nov. 13 , 2002 , § § 1(9 ) , 2(a ) , 3(a ) , 116Stat . 2057 , 2058 , 20602061 ( reaffirming the Pledge of Allegiance and the National Motto ( In God We Trust ) and stating that the Pledge of Allegiance is clearly consistent with the text and intent of the Constitution ) . Nothing stands behind the Courts assertion that governmental affirmation of the societys belief in God is unconstitutional except the Courts own say - so , citing as support only the unsubstantiated say - so of earlier Courts going back no farther than the mid-20th century . See ante , at 11 , citing Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints v. Amos , 483 U. S. 327 , 335 ( 1987 ) , in turn citing Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.

And it is discredited because the Court has not had the courage ( or the foolhardiness ) to apply the neutrality principle consistently .	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

Justice Stevens also appeals to the undoubted fact that some in the founding generation thought that the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment should have a narrower meaning , protecting only the Christian religion or perhaps only Protestantism . See Van Orden , ante , at 2022 . I am at a loss to see how this helps his case , except by providing a cloud of obfuscating smoke . ( Since most thought the Clause permitted government invocation of monotheism , and some others thought it permitted government invocation of Christianity , he proposes that it be construed not to permit any government invocation of religion at all . ) At any rate , those narrower views of the Establishment Clause were as clearly rejected as the more expansive ones . Washingtons First Thanksgiving Proclamation is merely an example . All of the actions of Washington and the First Congress upon which I have relied , virtually all Thanksgiving Proclamations throughout our history , 5 and all the other examples of our Governments favoring religion that I have cited , have invoked God , but not Jesus Christ . 6 Rather than relying upon Justice Stevens  assurance that [t]he original understanding of the type of religion that qualified for constitutional protection under the First amendment certainly did not include . . . followers of Judaism and Islam, Van Orden , ante , at 22 ; see also ante , at 3233 , I would prefer to take the word of George Washington , who , in his famous Letter to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport , Rhode Island , wrote that ,	Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other state . And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts , records , and proceedings shall be proved , and the effect thereof .	0

Justice Stevens says that if one is serious about following the original understanding of the Establishment Clause , he must repudiate its incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment , and hold that it does not apply against the States .

Finally , I must respond to Justice Stevens  assertion that I would marginaliz[e ] the belief systems of more than 7 million Americans who adhere to religions that are not monotheistic . Van Orden , ante , at 1314 , n. 18 ( dissenting opinion ) . Surely that is a gross exaggeration . The beliefs of those citizens are entirely protected by the Free Exercise Clause , and by those aspects of the Establishment Clause that do not relate to government acknowledgment of the Creator . Invocation of God despite their beliefs is permitted not because nonmonotheistic religions cease to be religions recognized by the religion clauses of the First Amendment , but because governmental invocation of God is not an establishment . Justice Stevens fails to recognize that in the context of public acknowledgments of God there are legitimate competing interests : On the one hand , the interest of that minority in not feeling excluded ; but on the other , the interest of the overwhelming majority of religious believers in being able to give God thanks and supplication as a people , and with respect to our national endeavors . Our national tradition has resolved that conflict in favor of the majority . 8 It is not for this Court to change a disposition that accounts , many Americans think , for the phenomenon remarked upon in a quotation attributed to various authors , including Bismarck , but which I prefer to associate with Charles de Gaulle : God watches over little children , drunkards , and the United States of America.	The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises , to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States ; but all duties , imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States ; To borrow money on the credit of the United States ; To regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several states , and with the Indian tribes ; To establish a uniform rule of naturalization , and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States ; To coin money , regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin , and fix the standard of weights and measures ; To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States ; To establish post offices and post roads ; To promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries ; To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court ; To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas , and offenses against the law of nations ; To declare war , grant letters of marque and reprisal , and make rules concerning captures on land and water ; To raise and support armies , but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years ; To provide and maintain a navy ; To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces ; To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union , suppress insurrections and repel invasions ; To provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining , the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , reserving to the states respectively , the appointment of the officers , and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress ; To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten miles square ) as may , by cession of particular states , and the acceptance of Congress , become the seat of the government of the United States , and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be , for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , dockyards , and other needful buildings ;-- And To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof .	0

And it is discredited because the Court has not had the courage ( or the foolhardiness ) to apply the neutrality principle consistently .	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0

Justice Stevens also appeals to the undoubted fact that some in the founding generation thought that the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment should have a narrower meaning , protecting only the Christian religion or perhaps only Protestantism . See Van Orden , ante , at 2022 . I am at a loss to see how this helps his case , except by providing a cloud of obfuscating smoke . ( Since most thought the Clause permitted government invocation of monotheism , and some others thought it permitted government invocation of Christianity , he proposes that it be construed not to permit any government invocation of religion at all . ) At any rate , those narrower views of the Establishment Clause were as clearly rejected as the more expansive ones . Washingtons First Thanksgiving Proclamation is merely an example .

Justice Stevens says that if one is serious about following the original understanding of the Establishment Clause , he must repudiate its incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment , and hold that it does not apply against the States . See Van Orden , ante , at 2426 ( dissenting opinion ) . This is more smoke . Justice Stevens did not feel that way last Term , when he joined an opinion insisting upon the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause , but nonetheless applying it against the State of Washington . See Crawford v. Washington , 541 U. S. 36 ( 2004 ) . The notion that incorporation empties the incorporated provisions of their original meaning has no support in either reason or precedent .	The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January , and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January , of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified ; and the terms of their successors shall then begin . The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year , and such meeting shall begin at noon on the 3d day of January , unless they shall by law appoint a different day . If , at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the President , the President elect shall have died , the Vice President elect shall become President . If a President shall not have been chosen before the time fixed for the beginning of his term , or if the President elect shall have failed to qualify , then the Vice President elect shall act as President until a President shall have qualified ; and the Congress may by law provide for the case wherein neither a President elect nor a Vice President elect shall have qualified , declaring who shall then act as President , or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected , and such person shall act accordingly until a President or Vice President shall have qualified . The Congress may by law provide for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the House of Representatives may choose a President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them , and for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the Senate may choose a Vice President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them . Sections 1 and 2 shall take effect on the 15th day of October following the ratification of this article . This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three - fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission .	0

See Crawford v. Washington , 541 U. S. 36 ( 2004 ) . The notion that incorporation empties the incorporated provisions of their original meaning has no support in either reason or precedent .	The judicial power shall extend to all cases , in law and equity , arising under this Constitution , the laws of the United States , and treaties made , or which shall be made , under their authority ;-- to all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls ;-- to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ;-- to controversies to which the United States shall be a party ;-- to controversies between two or more states ;-- between a state and citizens of another state ;-- between citizens of different states ;-- between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states , and between a state , or the citizens thereof , and foreign states , citizens or subjects . In all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , and those in which a state shall be party , the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction . In all the other cases before mentioned , the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction , both as to law and fact , with such exceptions , and under such regulations as the Congress shall make . The trial of all crimes , except in cases of impeachment , shall be by jury ; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed ; but when not committed within any state , the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed .	0
Finally , I must respond to Justice Stevens  assertion that I would marginaliz[e ] the belief systems of more than 7 million Americans who adhere to religions that are not monotheistic . Van Orden , ante , at 1314 , n. 18 ( dissenting opinion ) . Surely that is a gross exaggeration . The beliefs of those citizens are entirely protected by the Free Exercise Clause , and by those aspects of the Establishment Clause that do not relate to government acknowledgment of the Creator . Invocation of God despite their beliefs is permitted not because nonmonotheistic religions cease to be religions recognized by the religion clauses of the First Amendment , but because governmental invocation of God is not an establishment . Justice Stevens fails to recognize that in the context of public acknowledgments of God there are legitimate competing interests : On the one hand , the interest of that minority in not feeling excluded ; but on the other , the interest of the overwhelming majority of religious believers in being able to give God thanks and supplication as a people , and with respect to our national endeavors . Our national tradition has resolved that conflict in favor of the majority . 8 It is not for this Court to change a disposition that accounts , many Americans think , for the phenomenon remarked upon in a quotation attributed to various authors , including Bismarck , but which I prefer to associate with Charles de Gaulle : God watches over little children , drunkards , and the United States of America.	The migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit , shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight , but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation , not exceeding ten dollars for each person . The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended , unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it . No bill of attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed . No capitation , or other direct , tax shall be laid , unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken . No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state . No preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one state over those of another : nor shall vessels bound to , or from , one state , be obliged to enter , clear or pay duties in another . No money shall be drawn from the treasury , but in consequence of appropriations made by law ; and a regular statement and account of receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time . No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States : and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them , shall , without the consent of the Congress , accept of any present , emolument , office , or title , of any kind whatever , from any king , prince , or foreign state .	0

The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate .

The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .

Nothing stands behind the Courts assertion that governmental affirmation of the societys belief in God is unconstitutional except the Courts own say - so , citing as support only the unsubstantiated say - so of earlier Courts going back no farther than the mid-20th century .

It is discredited , to begin with , because a majority of the Justices on the current Court ( including at least one Member of todays majority ) have , in separate opinions , repudiated the brain - spun  Lemon test that embodies the supposed principle of neutrality between religion and irreligion .

Justice Stevens also appeals to the undoubted fact that some in the founding generation thought that the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment should have a narrower meaning , protecting only the Christian religion or perhaps only Protestantism . See Van Orden , ante , at 2022 . I am at a loss to see how this helps his case , except by providing a cloud of obfuscating smoke . ( Since most thought the Clause permitted government invocation of monotheism , and some others thought it permitted government invocation of Christianity , he proposes that it be construed not to permit any government invocation of religion at all . ) At any rate , those narrower views of the Establishment Clause were as clearly rejected as the more expansive ones . Washingtons First Thanksgiving Proclamation is merely an example . All of the actions of Washington and the First Congress upon which I have relied , virtually all Thanksgiving Proclamations throughout our history , 5 and all the other examples of our Governments favoring religion that I have cited , have invoked God , but not Jesus Christ . 6 Rather than relying upon Justice Stevens  assurance that [t]he original understanding of the type of religion that qualified for constitutional protection under the First amendment certainly did not include . . . followers of Judaism and Islam, Van Orden , ante , at 22 ; see also ante , at 3233 , I would prefer to take the word of George Washington , who , in his famous Letter to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport , Rhode Island , wrote that ,	The judicial power shall extend to all cases , in law and equity , arising under this Constitution , the laws of the United States , and treaties made , or which shall be made , under their authority ;-- to all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls ;-- to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ;-- to controversies to which the United States shall be a party ;-- to controversies between two or more states ;-- between a state and citizens of another state ;-- between citizens of different states ;-- between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states , and between a state , or the citizens thereof , and foreign states , citizens or subjects . In all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , and those in which a state shall be party , the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction . In all the other cases before mentioned , the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction , both as to law and fact , with such exceptions , and under such regulations as the Congress shall make . The trial of all crimes , except in cases of impeachment , shall be by jury ; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed ; but when not committed within any state , the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed .	0

Justice Stevens says that if one is serious about following the original understanding of the Establishment Clause , he must repudiate its incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment , and hold that it does not apply against the States . See Van Orden , ante , at 2426 ( dissenting opinion ) . This is more smoke . Justice Stevens did not feel that way last Term , when he joined an opinion insisting upon the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause , but nonetheless applying it against the State of Washington . See Crawford v. Washington , 541 U. S. 36 ( 2004 ) . The notion that incorporation empties the incorporated provisions of their original meaning has no support in either reason or precedent .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	0

Finally , I must respond to Justice Stevens  assertion that I would marginaliz[e ] the belief systems of more than 7 million Americans who adhere to religions that are not monotheistic . Van Orden , ante , at 1314 , n. 18 ( dissenting opinion ) . Surely that is a gross exaggeration . The beliefs of those citizens are entirely protected by the Free Exercise Clause , and by those aspects of the Establishment Clause that do not relate to government acknowledgment of the Creator . Invocation of God despite their beliefs is permitted not because nonmonotheistic religions cease to be religions recognized by the religion clauses of the First Amendment , but because governmental invocation of God is not an establishment . Justice Stevens fails to recognize that in the context of public acknowledgments of God there are legitimate competing interests : On the one hand , the interest of that minority in not feeling excluded ; but on the other , the interest of the overwhelming majority of religious believers in being able to give God thanks and supplication as a people , and with respect to our national endeavors . Our national tradition has resolved that conflict in favor of the majority . 8 It is not for this Court to change a disposition that accounts , many Americans think , for the phenomenon remarked upon in a quotation attributed to various authors , including Bismarck , but which I prefer to associate with Charles de Gaulle : God watches over little children , drunkards , and the United States of America.	He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .	0

Justice Stevens also appeals to the undoubted fact that some in the founding generation thought that the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment should have a narrower meaning , protecting only the Christian religion or perhaps only Protestantism . See Van Orden , ante , at 2022 . I am at a loss to see how this helps his case , except by providing a cloud of obfuscating smoke .

Washingtons First Thanksgiving Proclamation is merely an example .

Justice Stevens says that if one is serious about following the original understanding of the Establishment Clause , he must repudiate its incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment , and hold that it does not apply against the States .

Finally , I must respond to Justice Stevens  assertion that I would marginaliz[e ] the belief systems of more than 7 million Americans who adhere to religions that are not monotheistic . Van Orden , ante , at 1314 , n. 18 ( dissenting opinion ) . Surely that is a gross exaggeration . The beliefs of those citizens are entirely protected by the Free Exercise Clause , and by those aspects of the Establishment Clause that do not relate to government acknowledgment of the Creator . Invocation of God despite their beliefs is permitted not because nonmonotheistic religions cease to be religions recognized by the religion clauses of the First Amendment , but because governmental invocation of God is not an establishment . Justice Stevens fails to recognize that in the context of public acknowledgments of God there are legitimate competing interests : On the one hand , the interest of that minority in not feeling excluded ; but on the other , the interest of the overwhelming majority of religious believers in being able to give God thanks and supplication as a people , and with respect to our national endeavors . Our national tradition has resolved that conflict in favor of the majority . 8 It is not for this Court to change a disposition that accounts , many Americans think , for the phenomenon remarked upon in a quotation attributed to various authors , including Bismarck , but which I prefer to associate with Charles de Gaulle : God watches over little children , drunkards , and the United States of America.	A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed .	0

With all of this reality ( and much more ) staring it in the face , how can the Court possibly assert that  the First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between … religion and nonreligion,  ante , at 11 , and that [m]anifesting a purpose to favor . . . adherence to religion generally, ante , at 12 , is unconstitutional ? Who says so ? Surely not the words of the Constitution . Surely not the history and traditions that reflect our societys constant understanding of those words . Surely not even the current sense of our society , recently reflected in an Act of Congress adopted unanimously by the Senate and with only 5 nays in the House of Representatives , see 148 Cong . Rec . S6226 ( 2002 ) ; i d . , at H7186 , criticizing a Court of Appeals opinion that had held under God in the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional . See Act of Nov. 13 , 2002 , § § 1(9 ) , 2(a ) , 3(a ) , 116Stat . 2057 , 2058 , 20602061 ( reaffirming the Pledge of Allegiance and the National Motto ( In God We Trust ) and stating that the Pledge of Allegiance is clearly consistent with the text and intent of the Constitution ) . Nothing stands behind the Courts assertion that governmental affirmation of the societys belief in God is unconstitutional except the Courts own say - so , citing as support only the unsubstantiated say - so of earlier Courts going back no farther than the mid-20th century . See ante , at 11 , citing Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints v. Amos , 483 U. S. 327 , 335 ( 1987 ) , in turn citing Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.

S. 1 , 15 ( 1947 ) . 2 And it is , moreover , a thoroughly discredited say - so . It is discredited , to begin with , because a majority of the Justices on the current Court ( including at least one Member of todays majority ) have , in separate opinions , repudiated the brain - spun  Lemon test that embodies the supposed principle of neutrality between religion and irreligion . See Lambs Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist . , 508 U. S. 384 , 398399 ( 1993 ) ( Scalia , J. , concurring in judgment ) ( collecting criticism of Lemon ) ; Van Orden , ante , at 1 , 6 ( Thomas , J. , concurring ) ; Board of Ed . of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist . v.

And it is discredited because the Court has not had the courage ( or the foolhardiness ) to apply the neutrality principle consistently .

Justice Stevens also appeals to the undoubted fact that some in the founding generation thought that the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment should have a narrower meaning , protecting only the Christian religion or perhaps only Protestantism . See Van Orden , ante , at 2022 . I am at a loss to see how this helps his case , except by providing a cloud of obfuscating smoke .

Justice Stevens also appeals to the undoubted fact that some in the founding generation thought that the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment should have a narrower meaning , protecting only the Christian religion or perhaps only Protestantism .

Justice Stevens says that if one is serious about following the original understanding of the Establishment Clause , he must repudiate its incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment , and hold that it does not apply against the States . See Van Orden , ante , at 2426 ( dissenting opinion ) . This is more smoke . Justice Stevens did not feel that way last Term , when he joined an opinion insisting upon the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause , but nonetheless applying it against the State of Washington . See Crawford v. Washington , 541 U. S. 36 ( 2004 ) . The notion that incorporation empties the incorporated provisions of their original meaning has no support in either reason or precedent .	Each House shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members , and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business ; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day , and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members , in such manner , and under such penalties as each House may provide . Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings , punish its members for disorderly behavior , and , with the concurrence of two thirds , expel a member . Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings , and from time to time publish the same , excepting such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy ; and the yeas and nays of the members of either House on any question shall , at the desire of one fifth of those present , be entered on the journal .

Finally , I must respond to Justice Stevens  assertion that I would marginaliz[e ] the belief systems of more than 7 million Americans who adhere to religions that are not monotheistic . Van Orden , ante , at 1314 , n. 18 ( dissenting opinion ) . Surely that is a gross exaggeration . The beliefs of those citizens are entirely protected by the Free Exercise Clause , and by those aspects of the Establishment Clause that do not relate to government acknowledgment of the Creator . Invocation of God despite their beliefs is permitted not because nonmonotheistic religions cease to be religions recognized by the religion clauses of the First Amendment , but because governmental invocation of God is not an establishment . Justice Stevens fails to recognize that in the context of public acknowledgments of God there are legitimate competing interests : On the one hand , the interest of that minority in not feeling excluded ; but on the other , the interest of the overwhelming majority of religious believers in being able to give God thanks and supplication as a people , and with respect to our national endeavors . Our national tradition has resolved that conflict in favor of the majority . 8 It is not for this Court to change a disposition that accounts , many Americans think , for the phenomenon remarked upon in a quotation attributed to various authors , including Bismarck , but which I prefer to associate with Charles de Gaulle : God watches over little children , drunkards , and the United States of America.	The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state , chosen by the legislature thereof , for six years ; and each Senator shall have one vote . Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election , they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes . The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen by resignation , or otherwise , during the recess of the legislature of any state , the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature , which shall then fill such vacancies . No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years , and been nine years a citizen of the United States and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen . The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate , but shall have no vote , unless they be equally divided . The Senate shall choose their other officers , and also a President pro tempore , in the absence of the Vice President , or when he shall exercise the office of President of the United States . The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments . When sitting for that purpose , they shall be on oath or affirmation . When the President of the United States is tried , the Chief Justice shall preside : And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present . Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office , and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor , trust or profit under the United States : but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment , trial , judgment and punishment , according to law .	0

All of the actions of Washington and the First Congress upon which I have relied , virtually all Thanksgiving Proclamations throughout our history , 5 and all the other examples of our Governments favoring religion that I have cited , have invoked God , but not Jesus Christ . 6 Rather than relying upon Justice Stevens  assurance that [t]he original understanding of the type of religion that qualified for constitutional protection under the First amendment certainly did not include . . . followers of Judaism and Islam, Van Orden , ante , at 22 ; see also ante , at 3233 , I would prefer to take the word of George Washington , who , in his famous Letter to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport , Rhode Island , wrote that ,	No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice , and no person who has held the office of President , or acted as President , for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once .

Justice Stevens also appeals to the undoubted fact that some in the founding generation thought that the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment should have a narrower meaning , protecting only the Christian religion or perhaps only Protestantism . See Van Orden , ante , at 2022 . I am at a loss to see how this helps his case , except by providing a cloud of obfuscating smoke .

Justice Stevens says that if one is serious about following the original understanding of the Establishment Clause , he must repudiate its incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment , and hold that it does not apply against the States . See Van Orden , ante , at 2426 ( dissenting opinion ) . This is more smoke . Justice Stevens did not feel that way last Term , when he joined an opinion insisting upon the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause , but nonetheless applying it against the State of Washington . See Crawford v. Washington , 541 U. S. 36 ( 2004 ) . The notion that incorporation empties the incorporated provisions of their original meaning has no support in either reason or precedent .	Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other state . And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts , records , and proceedings shall be proved , and the effect thereof . The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states . A person charged in any state with treason , felony , or other crime , who shall flee from justice , and be found in another state , shall on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled , be delivered up , to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime . No person held to service or labor in one state , under the laws thereof , escaping into another , shall , in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due . New states may be admitted by the Congress into this union ; but no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state ; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states , or parts of states , without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress . The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States ; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States , or of any particular state . The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government , and shall protect each of them against invasion ; and on application of the legislature , or of the executive ( when the legislature can not be convened ) against domestic violence .	0

Finally , I must respond to Justice Stevens  assertion that I would marginaliz[e ] the belief systems of more than 7 million Americans who adhere to religions that are not monotheistic . Van Orden , ante , at 1314 , n. 18 ( dissenting opinion ) . Surely that is a gross exaggeration . The beliefs of those citizens are entirely protected by the Free Exercise Clause , and by those aspects of the Establishment Clause that do not relate to government acknowledgment of the Creator . Invocation of God despite their beliefs is permitted not because nonmonotheistic religions cease to be religions recognized by the religion clauses of the First Amendment , but because governmental invocation of God is not an establishment . Justice Stevens fails to recognize that in the context of public acknowledgments of God there are legitimate competing interests : On the one hand , the interest of that minority in not feeling excluded ; but on the other , the interest of the overwhelming majority of religious believers in being able to give God thanks and supplication as a people , and with respect to our national endeavors . Our national tradition has resolved that conflict in favor of the majority . 8 It is not for this Court to change a disposition that accounts , many Americans think , for the phenomenon remarked upon in a quotation attributed to various authors , including Bismarck , but which I prefer to associate with Charles de Gaulle : God watches over little children , drunkards , and the United States of America.	No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia , when in actual service in time of war or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation .	0

Justice Stevens also appeals to the undoubted fact that some in the founding generation thought that the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment should have a narrower meaning , protecting only the Christian religion or perhaps only Protestantism . See Van Orden , ante , at 2022 . I am at a loss to see how this helps his case , except by providing a cloud of obfuscating smoke . ( Since most thought the Clause permitted government invocation of monotheism , and some others thought it permitted government invocation of Christianity , he proposes that it be construed not to permit any government invocation of religion at all . ) At any rate , those narrower views of the Establishment Clause were as clearly rejected as the more expansive ones . Washingtons First Thanksgiving Proclamation is merely an example . All of the actions of Washington and the First Congress upon which I have relied , virtually all Thanksgiving Proclamations throughout our history , 5 and all the other examples of our Governments favoring religion that I have cited , have invoked God , but not Jesus Christ . 6 Rather than relying upon Justice Stevens  assurance that [t]he original understanding of the type of religion that qualified for constitutional protection under the First amendment certainly did not include . . . followers of Judaism and Islam, Van Orden , ante , at 22 ; see also ante , at 3233 , I would prefer to take the word of George Washington , who , in his famous Letter to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport , Rhode Island , wrote that ,	The eighteenth article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed .

Justice Stevens says that if one is serious about following the original understanding of the Establishment Clause , he must repudiate its incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment , and hold that it does not apply against the States . See Van Orden , ante , at 2426 ( dissenting opinion ) . This is more smoke . Justice Stevens did not feel that way last Term , when he joined an opinion insisting upon the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause , but nonetheless applying it against the State of Washington . See Crawford v. Washington , 541 U. S. 36 ( 2004 ) . The notion that incorporation empties the incorporated provisions of their original meaning has no support in either reason or precedent .	He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .	0

Finally , I must respond to Justice Stevens  assertion that I would marginaliz[e ] the belief systems of more than 7 million Americans who adhere to religions that are not monotheistic . Van Orden , ante , at 1314 , n. 18 ( dissenting opinion ) . Surely that is a gross exaggeration . The beliefs of those citizens are entirely protected by the Free Exercise Clause , and by those aspects of the Establishment Clause that do not relate to government acknowledgment of the Creator . Invocation of God despite their beliefs is permitted not because nonmonotheistic religions cease to be religions recognized by the religion clauses of the First Amendment , but because governmental invocation of God is not an establishment . Justice Stevens fails to recognize that in the context of public acknowledgments of God there are legitimate competing interests : On the one hand , the interest of that minority in not feeling excluded ; but on the other , the interest of the overwhelming majority of religious believers in being able to give God thanks and supplication as a people , and with respect to our national endeavors . Our national tradition has resolved that conflict in favor of the majority . 8 It is not for this Court to change a disposition that accounts , many Americans think , for the phenomenon remarked upon in a quotation attributed to various authors , including Bismarck , but which I prefer to associate with Charles de Gaulle : God watches over little children , drunkards , and the United States of America.	Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other state . And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts , records , and proceedings shall be proved , and the effect thereof . The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states .

No person held to service or labor in one state , under the laws thereof , escaping into another , shall , in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due . New states may be admitted by the Congress into this union ; but no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state ; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states , or parts of states , without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress . The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States ; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States , or of any particular state .

With all of this reality ( and much more ) staring it in the face , how can the Court possibly assert that  the First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between … religion and nonreligion,  ante , at 11 , and that [m]anifesting a purpose to favor . . . adherence to religion generally, ante , at 12 , is unconstitutional ? Who says so ? Surely not the words of the Constitution . Surely not the history and traditions that reflect our societys constant understanding of those words .

Justice Stevens also appeals to the undoubted fact that some in the founding generation thought that the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment should have a narrower meaning , protecting only the Christian religion or perhaps only Protestantism . See Van Orden , ante , at 2022 . I am at a loss to see how this helps his case , except by providing a cloud of obfuscating smoke . ( Since most thought the Clause permitted government invocation of monotheism , and some others thought it permitted government invocation of Christianity , he proposes that it be construed not to permit any government invocation of religion at all . ) At any rate , those narrower views of the Establishment Clause were as clearly rejected as the more expansive ones . Washingtons First Thanksgiving Proclamation is merely an example . All of the actions of Washington and the First Congress upon which I have relied , virtually all Thanksgiving Proclamations throughout our history , 5 and all the other examples of our Governments favoring religion that I have cited , have invoked God , but not Jesus Christ . 6 Rather than relying upon Justice Stevens  assurance that [t]he original understanding of the type of religion that qualified for constitutional protection under the First amendment certainly did not include . . . followers of Judaism and Islam, Van Orden , ante , at 22 ; see also ante , at 3233 , I would prefer to take the word of George Washington , who , in his famous Letter to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport , Rhode Island , wrote that ,	He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .	0

Justice Stevens says that if one is serious about following the original understanding of the Establishment Clause , he must repudiate its incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment , and hold that it does not apply against the States . See Van Orden , ante , at 2426 ( dissenting opinion ) . This is more smoke . Justice Stevens did not feel that way last Term , when he joined an opinion insisting upon the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause , but nonetheless applying it against the State of Washington . See Crawford v. Washington , 541 U. S. 36 ( 2004 ) . The notion that incorporation empties the incorporated provisions of their original meaning has no support in either reason or precedent .	The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state , elected by the people thereof , for six years ; and each Senator shall have one vote . The electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislatures . When vacancies happen in the representation of any state in the Senate , the executive authority of such state shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies : Provided , that the legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct .

Finally , I must respond to Justice Stevens  assertion that I would marginaliz[e ] the belief systems of more than 7 million Americans who adhere to religions that are not monotheistic . Van Orden , ante , at 1314 , n. 18 ( dissenting opinion ) . Surely that is a gross exaggeration . The beliefs of those citizens are entirely protected by the Free Exercise Clause , and by those aspects of the Establishment Clause that do not relate to government acknowledgment of the Creator . Invocation of God despite their beliefs is permitted not because nonmonotheistic religions cease to be religions recognized by the religion clauses of the First Amendment , but because governmental invocation of God is not an establishment . Justice Stevens fails to recognize that in the context of public acknowledgments of God there are legitimate competing interests : On the one hand , the interest of that minority in not feeling excluded ; but on the other , the interest of the overwhelming majority of religious believers in being able to give God thanks and supplication as a people , and with respect to our national endeavors . Our national tradition has resolved that conflict in favor of the majority . 8 It is not for this Court to change a disposition that accounts , many Americans think , for the phenomenon remarked upon in a quotation attributed to various authors , including Bismarck , but which I prefer to associate with Charles de Gaulle : God watches over little children , drunkards , and the United States of America.	Done in convention by the unanimous consent of the states present the seventeenth day of September in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven and of the independence of the United States of America the twelfth .

Justice Stevens did not feel that way last Term , when he joined an opinion insisting upon the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause , but nonetheless applying it against the State of Washington . See Crawford v. Washington , 541 U. S. 36 ( 2004 ) . The notion that incorporation empties the incorporated provisions of their original meaning has no support in either reason or precedent .	Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted .	0
Finally , I must respond to Justice Stevens  assertion that I would marginaliz[e ] the belief systems of more than 7 million Americans who adhere to religions that are not monotheistic . Van Orden , ante , at 1314 , n. 18 ( dissenting opinion ) . Surely that is a gross exaggeration . The beliefs of those citizens are entirely protected by the Free Exercise Clause , and by those aspects of the Establishment Clause that do not relate to government acknowledgment of the Creator . Invocation of God despite their beliefs is permitted not because nonmonotheistic religions cease to be religions recognized by the religion clauses of the First Amendment , but because governmental invocation of God is not an establishment . Justice Stevens fails to recognize that in the context of public acknowledgments of God there are legitimate competing interests : On the one hand , the interest of that minority in not feeling excluded ; but on the other , the interest of the overwhelming majority of religious believers in being able to give God thanks and supplication as a people , and with respect to our national endeavors . Our national tradition has resolved that conflict in favor of the majority . 8 It is not for this Court to change a disposition that accounts , many Americans think , for the phenomenon remarked upon in a quotation attributed to various authors , including Bismarck , but which I prefer to associate with Charles de Gaulle : God watches over little children , drunkards , and the United States of America.	Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other state . And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts , records , and proceedings shall be proved , and the effect thereof .	0

The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen by resignation , or otherwise , during the recess of the legislature of any state , the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature , which shall then fill such vacancies .

The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments . When sitting for that purpose , they shall be on oath or affirmation . When the President of the United States is tried , the Chief Justice shall preside : And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present . Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office , and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor , trust or profit under the United States : but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment , trial , judgment and punishment , according to law . The times , places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives , shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof ; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations , except as to the places of choosing Senators . The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year , and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December , unless they shall by law appoint a different day . Each House shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members , and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business ; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day , and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members , in such manner , and under such penalties as each House may provide .

Neither House , during the session of Congress , shall , without the consent of the other , adjourn for more than three days , nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting . The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services , to be ascertained by law , and paid out of the treasury of the United States . They shall in all cases , except treason , felony and breach of the peace , be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same ; and for any speech or debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other place . No Senator or Representative shall , during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time : and no person holding any office under the United States , shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office . All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it become a law , be presented to the President of the United States ; if he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it . If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law . But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays , and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively . If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall have been presented to him , the same shall be a law , in like manner as if he had signed it , unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return , in which case it shall not be a law . Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill .

In Brooks Furniture , the Federal Circuit imported the PRE standard into § 285 . See 393 F. 3d , at 1381 . But the PRE standard finds no roots in the text of § 285 , and it makes little sense in the context of determining whether a case is so “ exceptional ” as to justify an award of attorney ’s fees in patent litigation . We crafted the Noerr - Pennington doctrine — and carved out only a narrow exception for “ sham ” litigation — to avoid chilling the exercise of the First Amendment right to petition the government for the redress of grievances . See PRE , 508 U. S. , at 56 ( “ Those who petition government for redress are generally immune from antitrust liability ” ) . But to the extent that patent suits are similarly protected as acts of petitioning , it is not clear why the shifting of fees in an “ exceptional ” case would diminish that right . The threat of antitrust liability ( and the attendant treble damages , 15 U. S. C. § 15 ) far more significantly chills the exercise of the right to petition than does the mere shifting of attorney ’s fees . In the Noerr - Pennington context , defendants seek immunity from a judicial declaration that their filing of a lawsuit was actually unlawful ; here , they seek immunity from a far less onerous declaration that they should bear the costs of that lawsuit in exceptional cases .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	1

The city of San Diego ( City ) , a petitioner here , terminated a police officer , respondent , for selling videotapes he made and for related activity .

Respondent brought suit alleging , among other things , that the termination violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to freedom of speech . The United States District Court for the Southern District of California granted summary judgment to the City . The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed .	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws .

But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof . But Congress may by a vote of two - thirds of each House , remove such disability . The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law , including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion , shall not be questioned . But neither the United States nor any state shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States , or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave ; but all such debts , obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void .

A government employee does not relinquish all First Amendment rights otherwise enjoyed by citizens just by reason of his or her employment . See , e.g. , Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ . of State of N. Y. , 385 U. S. 589 , 605606 ( 1967 ) . On the other hand , a governmental employer may impose certain restraints on the speech of its employees , restraints that would be unconstitutional if applied to the general public . The Court has recognized the right of employees to speak on matters of public concern , typically matters concerning government policies that are of interest to the public at large , a subject on which public employees are uniquely qualified to comment . See Connick , supra ; Pickering v. Board of Ed . of Township High School Dist . 205 , Will Cty . , 391 U. S. 563 ( 1968 ) . Outside of this category , the Court has held that when government employees speak or write on their own time on topics unrelated to their employment , the speech can have First Amendment protection , absent some governmental justification far stronger than mere speculation in regulating it . United States v. Treasury Employees , 513 U. S. 454 , 465 , 475 ( 1995 ) ( NTEU ) . We have little difficulty in concluding that the City was not barred from terminating Roe under either line of cases .

We have little difficulty in concluding that the City was not barred from terminating Roe under either line of cases .

Neither House , during the session of Congress , shall , without the consent of the other , adjourn for more than three days , nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting . The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services , to be ascertained by law , and paid out of the treasury of the United States . They shall in all cases , except treason , felony and breach of the peace , be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same ; and for any speech or debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other place . No Senator or Representative shall , during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time : and no person holding any office under the United States , shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office . All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it become a law , be presented to the President of the United States ; if he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it . If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law . But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays , and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively . If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall have been presented to him , the same shall be a law , in like manner as if he had signed it , unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return , in which case it shall not be a law . Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill .

We have little difficulty in concluding that the City was not barred from terminating Roe under either line of cases .	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each state , excluding Indians not taxed . But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof . But Congress may by a vote of two - thirds of each House , remove such disability . The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law , including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion , shall not be questioned . But neither the United States nor any state shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States , or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave ; but all such debts , obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void . The Congress shall have power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article .	0

In concluding that Roes activities qualified as a matter of public concern , the Court of Appeals relied heavily on the Courts decision in NTEU . 356 F. 3d , at 1117 . In NTEU it was established that the speech was unrelated to the employment and had no effect on the mission and purpose of the employer . The question was whether the Federal Government could impose certain monetary limitations on outside earnings from speaking or writing on a class of federal employees . The Court held that , within the particular classification of employment , the Government had shown no justification for the outside salary limitations . The First Amendment right of the employees sufficed to invalidate the restrictions on the outside earnings for such activities . The Court noted that throughout history public employees who undertook to write or to speak in their spare time had made substantial contributions to literature and art , NTEU , supra , at 465 , and observed that none of the speech at issue even arguably [ had ] any adverse impact on the employer . Ibid .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	1

In granting summary judgment to the City , the District Court decided that Roe had not demonstrated that selling official police uniforms and producing , marketing , and selling sexually explicit videos for profit qualified as expression relating to a matter of public concern under this Courts decision in Connick v. Myers , 461 U. S. 138 ( 1983 ) .	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0
A government employee does not relinquish all First Amendment rights otherwise enjoyed by citizens just by reason of his or her employment . See , e.g. , Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ . of State of N. Y. , 385 U. S. 589 , 605606 ( 1967 ) . On the other hand , a governmental employer may impose certain restraints on the speech of its employees , restraints that would be unconstitutional if applied to the general public . The Court has recognized the right of employees to speak on matters of public concern , typically matters concerning government policies that are of interest to the public at large , a subject on which public employees are uniquely qualified to comment . See Connick , supra ; Pickering v. Board of Ed . of Township High School Dist . 205 , Will Cty . , 391 U. S. 563 ( 1968 ) . Outside of this category , the Court has held that when government employees speak or write on their own time on topics unrelated to their employment , the speech can have First Amendment protection , absent some governmental justification far stronger than mere speculation in regulating it . United States v. Treasury Employees , 513 U. S. 454 , 465 , 475 ( 1995 ) ( NTEU ) .

In concluding that Roes activities qualified as a matter of public concern , the Court of Appeals relied heavily on the Courts decision in NTEU . 356 F. 3d , at 1117 . In NTEU it was established that the speech was unrelated to the employment and had no effect on the mission and purpose of the employer . The question was whether the Federal Government could impose certain monetary limitations on outside earnings from speaking or writing on a class of federal employees . The Court held that , within the particular classification of employment , the Government had shown no justification for the outside salary limitations . The First Amendment right of the employees sufficed to invalidate the restrictions on the outside earnings for such activities . The Court noted that throughout history public employees who undertook to write or to speak in their spare time had made substantial contributions to literature and art , NTEU , supra , at 465 , and observed that none of the speech at issue even arguably [ had ] any adverse impact on the employer . Ibid .	The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states . A person charged in any state with treason , felony , or other crime , who shall flee from justice , and be found in another state , shall on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled , be delivered up , to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime . No person held to service or labor in one state , under the laws thereof , escaping into another , shall , in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due .	0

In concluding that Roes activities qualified as a matter of public concern , the Court of Appeals relied heavily on the Courts decision in NTEU . 356 F. 3d , at 1117 . In NTEU it was established that the speech was unrelated to the employment and had no effect on the mission and purpose of the employer . The question was whether the Federal Government could impose certain monetary limitations on outside earnings from speaking or writing on a class of federal employees . The Court held that , within the particular classification of employment , the Government had shown no justification for the outside salary limitations . The First Amendment right of the employees sufficed to invalidate the restrictions on the outside earnings for such activities . The Court noted that throughout history public employees who undertook to write or to speak in their spare time had made substantial contributions to literature and art , NTEU , supra , at 465 , and observed that none of the speech at issue even arguably [ had ] any adverse impact on the employer . Ibid .	The ratification of the conventions of nine states , shall be sufficient for the establishment of this Constitution between the states so ratifying the same .	0
The city of San Diego ( City ) , a petitioner here , terminated a police officer , respondent , for selling videotapes he made and for related activity . The tapes showed the respondent engaging in sexually explicit acts . Respondent brought suit alleging , among other things , that the termination violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to freedom of speech . The United States District Court for the Southern District of California granted summary judgment to the City . The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed .	The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people .	0

Roe brought suit in the District Court pursuant to Rev. Stat . § 1979 , 42 U. S. C. § 1983 , alleging that the employment termination violated his First Amendment right to free speech . In granting summary judgment to the City , the District Court decided that Roe had not demonstrated that selling official police uniforms and producing , marketing , and selling sexually explicit videos for profit qualified as expression relating to a matter of public concern under this Courts decision in Connick v. Myers , 461 U. S. 138 ( 1983 ) .	The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes , from whatever source derived , without apportionment among the several states , and without regard to any census or enumeration .	0

The electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for President and Vice - President , one of whom , at least , shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves ; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President , and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice - President , and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President , and of all persons voted for as Vice - President , and of the number of votes for each , which lists they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate ;-- The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted ;-- the person having the greatest number of votes for President , shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if no person have such majority , then from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President , the House of Representatives shall choose immediately , by ballot , the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by states , the representation from each state having one vote ; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two - thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . And if the House of Representatives shall not choose a President whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them , before the fourth day of March next following , then the Vice - President shall act as President , as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President . The person having the greatest number of votes as Vice - President , shall be the Vice - President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed , and if no person have a majority , then from the two highest numbers on the list , the Senate shall choose the Vice - President ; a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two - thirds of the whole number of Senators , and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice . But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice - President of the United States .	0
A government employee does not relinquish all First Amendment rights otherwise enjoyed by citizens just by reason of his or her employment . See , e.g. , Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ . of State of N. Y. , 385 U. S. 589 , 605606 ( 1967 ) . On the other hand , a governmental employer may impose certain restraints on the speech of its employees , restraints that would be unconstitutional if applied to the general public . The Court has recognized the right of employees to speak on matters of public concern , typically matters concerning government policies that are of interest to the public at large , a subject on which public employees are uniquely qualified to comment . See Connick , supra ; Pickering v. Board of Ed . of Township High School Dist . 205 , Will Cty . , 391 U. S. 563 ( 1968 ) . Outside of this category , the Court has held that when government employees speak or write on their own time on topics unrelated to their employment , the speech can have First Amendment protection , absent some governmental justification far stronger than mere speculation in regulating it . United States v. Treasury Employees , 513 U. S. 454 , 465 , 475 ( 1995 ) ( NTEU ) . We have little difficulty in concluding that the City was not barred from terminating Roe under either line of cases .	In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation , the Vice President shall become President . Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President , the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress . Whenever the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office , and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary , such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President . Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide , transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office , the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President . Thereafter , when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists , he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide , transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office . Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue , assembling within forty - eight hours for that purpose if not in session . If the Congress , within twenty - one days after receipt of the latter written declaration , or , if Congress is not in session , within twenty - one days after Congress is required to assemble , determines by two - thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office , the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President ; otherwise , the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office .	0

We have little difficulty in concluding that the City was not barred from terminating Roe under either line of cases .	The judicial power of the United States , shall be vested in one Supreme Court , and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish . The judges , both of the supreme and inferior courts , shall hold their offices during good behaviour , and shall , at stated times , receive for their services , a compensation , which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office . The judicial power shall extend to all cases , in law and equity , arising under this Constitution , the laws of the United States , and treaties made , or which shall be made , under their authority ;-- to all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls ;-- to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ;-- to controversies to which the United States shall be a party ;-- to controversies between two or more states ;-- between a state and citizens of another state ;-- between citizens of different states ;-- between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states , and between a state , or the citizens thereof , and foreign states , citizens or subjects . In all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , and those in which a state shall be party , the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction . In all the other cases before mentioned , the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction , both as to law and fact , with such exceptions , and under such regulations as the Congress shall make . The trial of all crimes , except in cases of impeachment , shall be by jury ; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed ; but when not committed within any state , the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed . Treason against the United States , shall consist only in levying war against them , or in adhering to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort . No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act , or on confession in open court . The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason , but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood , or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted .	0

He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments .

The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen by resignation , or otherwise , during the recess of the legislature of any state , the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature , which shall then fill such vacancies . No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years , and been nine years a citizen of the United States and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen . The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate , but shall have no vote , unless they be equally divided .

If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law . But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays , and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively . If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall have been presented to him , the same shall be a law , in like manner as if he had signed it , unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return , in which case it shall not be a law . Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill .

On appeal , Ring argued that Arizonas capital sentencing scheme violates the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U. S. Constitution because it entrusts to a judge the finding of a fact raising the defendants maximum penalty . See Jones v. United States , 526 U. S. 227 ( 1999 ) ; Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U. S. 466 ( 2000 ) . The State , in response , noted that this Court had upheld Arizonas system in Walton v. Arizona , 497 U. S. 639 ( 1990 ) , and had stated in Apprendi that Walton remained good law .

But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof . But Congress may by a vote of two - thirds of each House , remove such disability . The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law , including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion , shall not be questioned . But neither the United States nor any state shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States , or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave ; but all such debts , obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void .

The Court had previously denied a Sixth Amendment challenge to Floridas capital sentencing system , in which the jury recommends a sentence but makes no explicit findings on aggravating circumstances ; we so ruled , Walton noted , on the ground that the Sixth Amendment does not require that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of the sentence of death be made by the jury. Id. , at 648 ( quoting Hildwin v.

The Court had previously denied a Sixth Amendment challenge to Floridas capital sentencing system , in which the jury recommends a sentence but makes no explicit findings on aggravating circumstances ; we so ruled , Walton noted , on the ground that the Sixth Amendment does not require that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of the sentence of death be made by the jury. Id. , at 648 ( quoting Hildwin v.

Walton found unavailing the attempts by the defendant - petitioner in that case to distinguish Floridas capital sentencing system from Arizonas . In neither State , according to Walton , were the aggravating factors elements of the offense ; in both States , they ranked as sentencing considerations guiding the choice between life and death . 497 U.

New states may be admitted by the Congress into this union ; but no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state ; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states , or parts of states , without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress .

S. , at 648 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0

In an effort to reconcile its capital sentencing system with the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by Apprendi , Arizona first restates the Apprendi majoritys portrayal of Arizonas system : Ring was convicted of first - degree murder , for which Arizona law specifies death or life imprisonment as the only sentencing options , see Ariz.

The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate .

The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them .

Apart from the Eighth Amendment provenance of aggravating factors , Arizona presents no specific reason for excepting capital defendants from the constitutional protections … extend[ed ] to defendants generally , and none is readily apparent. Id. , at 539 ( OConnor , J. , dissenting ) . The notion that the Eighth Amendments restriction on a state legislatures ability to define capital crimes should be compensated for by permitting States more leeway under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments in proving an aggravating fact necessary to a capital sentence … is without precedent in our constitutional jurisprudence. Ibid .	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0

In various settings , we have interpreted the Constitution to require the addition of an element or elements to the definition of a criminal offense in order to narrow its scope . See , e.g. , United States v. Lopez , 514 U. S. 549 , 561562 ( 1995 ) ( suggesting that addition to federal gun possession statute of express jurisdictional element requiring connection between weapon and interstate commerce would render statute constitutional under Commerce Clause ) ; Brandenburg v. Ohio , 395 U. S. 444 , 447 ( 1969 ) ( per curiam ) ( First Amendment prohibits States from proscrib[ing ] advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action ) ; Lambert v. California , 355 U. S. 225 , 229 ( 1957 ) ( Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment requires actual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the probability of such knowledge before ex - felon may be convicted of failing to register presence in municipality ) . If a legislature responded to one of these decisions by adding the element we held constitutionally required , surely the Sixth Amendment guarantee would apply to that element . We see no reason to differentiate capital crimes from all others in this regard .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	1

No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each state , excluding Indians not taxed .

No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof . But Congress may by a vote of two - thirds of each House , remove such disability . The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law , including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion , shall not be questioned . But neither the United States nor any state shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States , or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave ; but all such debts , obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void .

In Walton v. Arizona , 497 U.

On appeal , Ring argued that Arizonas capital sentencing scheme violates the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U. S.

As earlier indicated , see supra , at 1 , 89 , this is not the first time we have considered the constitutionality of Arizonas capital sentencing system . In Walton v. Arizona , 497 U.

The Court had previously denied a Sixth Amendment challenge to Floridas capital sentencing system , in which the jury recommends a sentence but makes no explicit findings on aggravating circumstances ; we so ruled , Walton noted , on the ground that the Sixth Amendment does not require that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of the sentence of death be made by the jury. Id. , at 648 ( quoting Hildwin v.

As earlier indicated , see supra , at 1 , 89 , this is not the first time we have considered the constitutionality of Arizonas capital sentencing system . In Walton v. Arizona , 497 U. S. 639 ( 1990 ) , we upheld Arizonas scheme against a charge that it violated the Sixth Amendment . The Court had previously denied a Sixth Amendment challenge to Floridas capital sentencing system , in which the jury recommends a sentence but makes no explicit findings on aggravating circumstances ; we so ruled , Walton noted , on the ground that the Sixth Amendment does not require that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of the sentence of death be made by the jury. Id. , at 648 ( quoting Hildwin v. Florida , 490 U. S. 638 , 640641 ( 1989 ) ( per curiam ) ) . Walton found unavailing the attempts by the defendant - petitioner in that case to distinguish Floridas capital sentencing system from Arizonas . In neither State , according to Walton , were the aggravating factors elements of the offense ; in both States , they ranked as sentencing considerations guiding the choice between life and death . 497 U. S. , at 648 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .	The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session .	0

No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

In an effort to reconcile its capital sentencing system with the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by Apprendi , Arizona first restates the Apprendi majoritys portrayal of Arizonas system : Ring was convicted of first - degree murder , for which Arizona law specifies death or life imprisonment as the only sentencing options , see Ariz. Rev. Stat . Ann . § 131105(C ) ( West 2001 ) ; Ring was therefore sentenced within the range of punishment authorized by the jury verdict . See Brief for Respondent 919 . This argument overlooks Apprendi s instruction that the relevant inquiry is one not of form , but of effect. 530 U. S. , at 494 . In effect , the required finding [ of an aggravated circumstance ] expose[d ] [ Ring ] to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jurys guilty verdict. Ibid . ; see 200 Ariz. , at 279 , 25 P. 3d , at 1151 . The Arizona first - degree murder statute authorizes a maximum penalty of death only in a formal sense, Apprendi , 530 U. S. , at 541 ( OConnor , J. , dissenting ) , for it explicitly cross - references the statutory provision requiring the finding of an aggravating circumstance before imposition of the death penalty . See § 131105(C ) ( First degree murder is a class 1 felony and is punishable by death or life imprisonment as provided by § 13703 . ( emphasis added ) ) . If Arizona prevailed on its opening argument , Apprendi would be reduced to a meaningless and formalistic rule of statutory drafting . See 530 U. S. , at 541 ( OConnor , J. , dissenting ) .	No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia , when in actual service in time of war or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation .	0

In various settings , we have interpreted the Constitution to require the addition of an element or elements to the definition of a criminal offense in order to narrow its scope .

S. 549 , 561562 ( 1995 ) ( suggesting that addition to federal gun possession statute of express jurisdictional element requiring connection between weapon and interstate commerce would render statute constitutional under Commerce Clause ) ; Brandenburg v. Ohio , 395 U. S. 444 , 447 ( 1969 ) ( per curiam ) ( First Amendment prohibits States from proscrib[ing ] advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action ) ; Lambert v.

S. 225 , 229 ( 1957 ) ( Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment requires actual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the probability of such knowledge before ex - felon may be convicted of failing to register presence in municipality ) . If a legislature responded to one of these decisions by adding the element we held constitutionally required , surely the Sixth Amendment guarantee would apply to that element .

No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty five years , and been seven years a citizen of the United States , and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen . Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union , according to their respective numbers , which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons , including those bound to service for a term of years , and excluding Indians not taxed , three fifths of all other Persons .

In Walton v. Arizona , 497 U.

On October 29 , 1997 , the trial judge entered his Special Verdict sentencing Ring to death . Because Ring was convicted of felony murder , not premeditated murder , the judge recognized that Ring was eligible for the death penalty only if he was Magochs actual killer or if he was a major participant in the armed robbery that led to the killing and exhibited a reckless disregard or indifference for human life. App . to Pet . for Cert . 46a47a ; see Enmund v. Florida , 458 U. S. 782 ( 1982 ) ( Eighth Amendment requires finding that felony - murder defendant killed or attempted to kill ) ; Tison v. Arizona , 481 U. S. 137 , 158 ( 1987 ) ( qualifying Enmund , and holding that Eighth Amendment permits execution of felony - murder defendant , who did not kill or attempt to kill , but who was a major participa[nt ] in the felony committed and who demonstrated reckless indifference to human life ) .	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0

On appeal , Ring argued that Arizonas capital sentencing scheme violates the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U. S.

As earlier indicated , see supra , at 1 , 89 , this is not the first time we have considered the constitutionality of Arizonas capital sentencing system . In Walton v. Arizona , 497 U.

The Court had previously denied a Sixth Amendment challenge to Floridas capital sentencing system , in which the jury recommends a sentence but makes no explicit findings on aggravating circumstances ; we so ruled , Walton noted , on the ground that the Sixth Amendment does not require that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of the sentence of death be made by the jury. Id. , at 648 ( quoting Hildwin v.

Walton found unavailing the attempts by the defendant - petitioner in that case to distinguish Floridas capital sentencing system from Arizonas . In neither State , according to Walton , were the aggravating factors elements of the offense ; in both States , they ranked as sentencing considerations guiding the choice between life and death . 497 U.

As earlier indicated , see supra , at 1 , 89 , this is not the first time we have considered the constitutionality of Arizonas capital sentencing system . In Walton v. Arizona , 497 U. S. 639 ( 1990 ) , we upheld Arizonas scheme against a charge that it violated the Sixth Amendment . The Court had previously denied a Sixth Amendment challenge to Floridas capital sentencing system , in which the jury recommends a sentence but makes no explicit findings on aggravating circumstances ; we so ruled , Walton noted , on the ground that the Sixth Amendment does not require that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of the sentence of death be made by the jury. Id. , at 648 ( quoting Hildwin v. Florida , 490 U. S. 638 , 640641 ( 1989 ) ( per curiam ) ) . Walton found unavailing the attempts by the defendant - petitioner in that case to distinguish Floridas capital sentencing system from Arizonas . In neither State , according to Walton , were the aggravating factors elements of the offense ; in both States , they ranked as sentencing considerations guiding the choice between life and death . 497 U.

In an effort to reconcile its capital sentencing system with the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by Apprendi , Arizona first restates the Apprendi majoritys portrayal of Arizonas system : Ring was convicted of first - degree murder , for which Arizona law specifies death or life imprisonment as the only sentencing options , see Ariz.

Even if facts increasing punishment beyond the maximum authorized by a guilty verdict standing alone ordinarily must be found by a jury , Arizona further urges , aggravating circumstances necessary to trigger a death sentence may nonetheless be reserved for judicial determination . As Arizonas counsel maintained at oral argument , there is no doubt that [d]eath is different. Tr . of Oral Arg . 43 .

For the reasons stated , we hold that Walton and Apprendi are irreconcilable ; our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence can not be home to both . Accordingly , we overrule Walton to the extent that it allows a sentencing judge , sitting without a jury , to find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty . See 497 U. S. , at 647649 . Because Arizonas enumerated aggravating factors operate as the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense, Apprendi , 530 U. S. , at 494 , n. 19 , the Sixth Amendment requires that they be found by a jury .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	0

And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate .

On October 29 , 1997 , the trial judge entered his Special Verdict sentencing Ring to death .

On appeal , Ring argued that Arizonas capital sentencing scheme violates the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U. S.

The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises , to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States ; but all duties , imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States ; To borrow money on the credit of the United States ; To regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several states , and with the Indian tribes ; To establish a uniform rule of naturalization , and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States ; To coin money , regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin , and fix the standard of weights and measures ; To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States ; To establish post offices and post roads ; To promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries ; To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court ; To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas , and offenses against the law of nations ; To declare war , grant letters of marque and reprisal , and make rules concerning captures on land and water ; To raise and support armies , but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years ; To provide and maintain a navy ; To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces ; To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union , suppress insurrections and repel invasions ; To provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining , the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , reserving to the states respectively , the appointment of the officers , and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress ; To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten miles square ) as may , by cession of particular states , and the acceptance of Congress , become the seat of the government of the United States , and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be , for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , dockyards , and other needful buildings ;-- And To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof .	0

In an effort to reconcile its capital sentencing system with the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by Apprendi , Arizona first restates the Apprendi majoritys portrayal of Arizonas system : Ring was convicted of first - degree murder , for which Arizona law specifies death or life imprisonment as the only sentencing options , see Ariz. Rev. Stat . Ann . § 131105(C ) ( West 2001 ) ; Ring was therefore sentenced within the range of punishment authorized by the jury verdict . See Brief for Respondent 919 .

S. 137 , 158 ( 1987 ) ( qualifying Enmund , and holding that Eighth Amendment permits execution of felony - murder defendant , who did not kill or attempt to kill , but who was a major participa[nt ] in the felony committed and who demonstrated reckless indifference to human life ) .	The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states . A person charged in any state with treason , felony , or other crime , who shall flee from justice , and be found in another state , shall on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled , be delivered up , to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime . No person held to service or labor in one state , under the laws thereof , escaping into another , shall , in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due .	0
On appeal , Ring argued that Arizonas capital sentencing scheme violates the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U. S. Constitution because it entrusts to a judge the finding of a fact raising the defendants maximum penalty . See Jones v. United States , 526 U. S. 227 ( 1999 ) ; Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U. S. 466 ( 2000 ) . The State , in response , noted that this Court had upheld Arizonas system in Walton v. Arizona , 497 U. S. 639 ( 1990 ) , and had stated in Apprendi that Walton remained good law .	No law , varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives , shall take effect , until an election of Representatives shall have intervened .	0

The Court had previously denied a Sixth Amendment challenge to Floridas capital sentencing system , in which the jury recommends a sentence but makes no explicit findings on aggravating circumstances ; we so ruled , Walton noted , on the ground that the Sixth Amendment does not require that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of the sentence of death be made by the jury. Id. , at 648 ( quoting Hildwin v.

In an effort to reconcile its capital sentencing system with the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by Apprendi , Arizona first restates the Apprendi majoritys portrayal of Arizonas system : Ring was convicted of first - degree murder , for which Arizona law specifies death or life imprisonment as the only sentencing options , see Ariz. Rev. Stat . Ann . § 131105(C ) ( West 2001 ) ; Ring was therefore sentenced within the range of punishment authorized by the jury verdict . See Brief for Respondent 919 . This argument overlooks Apprendi s instruction that the relevant inquiry is one not of form , but of effect. 530 U. S. , at 494 . In effect , the required finding [ of an aggravated circumstance ] expose[d ] [ Ring ] to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jurys guilty verdict. Ibid . ; see 200 Ariz. , at 279 , 25 P. 3d , at 1151 . The Arizona first - degree murder statute authorizes a maximum penalty of death only in a formal sense, Apprendi , 530 U. S. , at 541 ( OConnor , J. , dissenting ) , for it explicitly cross - references the statutory provision requiring the finding of an aggravating circumstance before imposition of the death penalty . See § 131105(C ) ( First degree murder is a class 1 felony and is punishable by death or life imprisonment as provided by § 13703 . ( emphasis added ) ) . If Arizona prevailed on its opening argument , Apprendi would be reduced to a meaningless and formalistic rule of statutory drafting . See 530 U. S. , at 541 ( OConnor , J. , dissenting ) .

He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments .

He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .

The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0
In any event , the superiority of judicial factfinding in capital cases is far from evident . Unlike Arizona , the great majority of States responded to this Courts Eighth Amendment decisions requiring the presence of aggravating circumstances in capital cases by entrusting those determinations to the jury . 6	The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state , or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state .	0

No state shall , without the consent of the Congress , lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports , except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it 's inspection laws : and the net produce of all duties and imposts , laid by any state on imports or exports , shall be for the use of the treasury of the United States ; and all such laws shall be subject to the revision and control of the Congress . No state shall , without the consent of Congress , lay any duty of tonnage , keep troops , or ships of war in time of peace , enter into any agreement or compact with another state , or with a foreign power , or engage in war , unless actually invaded , or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay .	0
For the reasons stated , we hold that Walton and Apprendi are irreconcilable ; our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence can not be home to both . Accordingly , we overrule Walton to the extent that it allows a sentencing judge , sitting without a jury , to find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty . See 497 U. S. , at 647649 . Because Arizonas enumerated aggravating factors operate as the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense, Apprendi , 530 U. S. , at 494 , n. 19 , the Sixth Amendment requires that they be found by a jury .	We the people of the United States , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America .	0

The right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment would be senselessly diminished if it encompassed the factfinding necessary to increase a defendants sentence by two years , but not the factfinding necessary to put him to death . We hold that the Sixth Amendment applies to both . The judgment of the Arizona Supreme Court is therefore reversed , and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion . 7	Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other state . And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts , records , and proceedings shall be proved , and the effect thereof .	0

The question whether Walton v. Arizona , 497 U. S. 639 ( 1990 ) , survives our decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U. S. 466 ( 2000 ) , confronts me with a difficult choice . What compelled Arizona ( and many other States ) to specify particular aggravating factors that must be found before the death penalty can be imposed , see 1973 Ariz. Sess . Laws ch . 138 , § 5 ( originally codified as Ariz. Rev. Stat . § 13454 ) , was the line of this Courts cases beginning with Furman v. Georgia , 408 U. S. 238 ( 1972 ) ( per curiam ) . See Walton , 497 U. S. , at 659660 ( Scalia , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) . In my view , that line of decisions had no proper foundation in the Constitution . Id. , at 670 (  [T]he prohibition of the Eighth Amendment relates to the character of the punishment , and not to the process by which it is imposed  ( quoting Gardner v. Florida , 430 U. S. 349 , 371 ( 1977 ) ( R ehnquist , J. , dissenting ) ) ) . I am therefore reluctant to magnify the burdens that our Furman jurisprudence imposes on the States . Better for the Court to have invented an evidentiary requirement that a judge can find by a preponderance of the evidence , than to invent one that a unanimous jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt .	Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted .	1

In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	1

The quandary is apparent : Should I continue to apply the last - stated principle when I know that the only reason the fact is essential is that this Court has mistakenly said that the Constitution requires state law to impose such aggravating factors ? In Walton , to tell the truth , the Sixth Amendment claim was not put with the clarity it obtained in Almendarez - Torres and Apprendi . There what the appellant argued had to be found by the jury was not all facts essential to imposition of the death penalty , but rather  every finding of fact underlying the sentencing decision, including not only the aggravating factors without which the penalty could not be imposed , but also the mitigating factors that might induce a sentencer to give a lesser punishment . 497 U. S. , at 647 ( emphasis added ) .

I add one further point , lest the holding of todays decision be confused by the separate concurrence . Justice Breyer , who refuses to accept Apprendi , see 530 U.

United States , ante , p. _ _ _ ( Breyer , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) , nonetheless concurs in todays judgment because he believe[s ] that jury sentencing in capital cases is mandated by the Eighth Amendment. Post , at 1 ( opinion concurring in judgment ) . While I am , as always , pleased to travel in Justice B reyer s company , the unfortunate fact is that todays judgment has nothing to do with jury sentencing . What todays decision says is that the jury must find the existence of the fact that an aggravating factor existed . Those States that leave the ultimate life - or - death decision to the judge may continue to do soby requiring a prior jury finding of aggravating factor in the sentencing phase or , more simply , by placing the aggravating - factor determination ( where it logically belongs anyway ) in the guilt phase . There is really no way in which Justice Breyer can travel with the happy band that reaches todays result unless he says yes to Apprendi . Concisely put , Justice Breyer is on the wrong flight ; he should either get off before the doors close , or buy a ticket to Apprendi -land .	Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted .	1

The quandary is apparent : Should I continue to apply the last - stated principle when I know that the only reason the fact is essential is that this Court has mistakenly said that the Constitution requires state law to impose such aggravating factors ? In Walton , to tell the truth , the Sixth Amendment claim was not put with the clarity it obtained in Almendarez - Torres and Apprendi . There what the appellant argued had to be found by the jury was not all facts essential to imposition of the death penalty , but rather  every finding of fact underlying the sentencing decision, including not only the aggravating factors without which the penalty could not be imposed , but also the mitigating factors that might induce a sentencer to give a lesser punishment . 497 U. S. , at 647 ( emphasis added ) .

What compelled Arizona ( and many other States ) to specify particular aggravating factors that must be found before the death penalty can be imposed , see 1973 Ariz. Sess . Laws ch . 138 , § 5 ( originally codified as Ariz. Rev. Stat . § 13454 ) , was the line of this Courts cases beginning with Furman v. Georgia , 408 U. S. 238 ( 1972 ) ( per curiam ) . See Walton , 497 U. S. , at 659660 ( Scalia , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) . In my view , that line of decisions had no proper foundation in the Constitution .

The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment .

If a President shall not have been chosen before the time fixed for the beginning of his term , or if the President elect shall have failed to qualify , then the Vice President elect shall act as President until a President shall have qualified ; and the Congress may by law provide for the case wherein neither a President elect nor a Vice President elect shall have qualified , declaring who shall then act as President , or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected , and such person shall act accordingly until a President or Vice President shall have qualified . The Congress may by law provide for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the House of Representatives may choose a President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them , and for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the Senate may choose a Vice President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them .

The electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for President and Vice - President , one of whom , at least , shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves ; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President , and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice - President , and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President , and of all persons voted for as Vice - President , and of the number of votes for each , which lists they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate ;-- The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted ;-- the person having the greatest number of votes for President , shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if no person have such majority , then from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President , the House of Representatives shall choose immediately , by ballot , the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by states , the representation from each state having one vote ; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two - thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice .

The quandary is apparent : Should I continue to apply the last - stated principle when I know that the only reason the fact is essential is that this Court has mistakenly said that the Constitution requires state law to impose such aggravating factors ? In Walton , to tell the truth , the Sixth Amendment claim was not put with the clarity it obtained in Almendarez - Torres and Apprendi . There what the appellant argued had to be found by the jury was not all facts essential to imposition of the death penalty , but rather  every finding of fact underlying the sentencing decision, including not only the aggravating factors without which the penalty could not be imposed , but also the mitigating factors that might induce a sentencer to give a lesser punishment . 497 U. S. , at 647 ( emphasis added ) . But even if the point had been put with greater clarity in Walton , I think I still would have approved the Arizona schemeI would have favored the States freedom to develop their own capital sentencing procedures ( already erroneously abridged by Furman ) over the logic of the Apprendi principle .	All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it become a law , be presented to the President of the United States ; if he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it . If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law . But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays , and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively . If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall have been presented to him , the same shall be a law , in like manner as if he had signed it , unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return , in which case it shall not be a law . Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill .	0

I add one further point , lest the holding of todays decision be confused by the separate concurrence . Justice Breyer , who refuses to accept Apprendi , see 530 U. S. , at 555 ( Breyer , J. , dissenting ) ; see also Harris v. United States , ante , p. _ _ _ ( Breyer , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) , nonetheless concurs in todays judgment because he believe[s ] that jury sentencing in capital cases is mandated by the Eighth Amendment. Post , at 1 ( opinion concurring in judgment ) . While I am , as always , pleased to travel in Justice B reyer s company , the unfortunate fact is that todays judgment has nothing to do with jury sentencing . What todays decision says is that the jury must find the existence of the fact that an aggravating factor existed . Those States that leave the ultimate life - or - death decision to the judge may continue to do soby requiring a prior jury finding of aggravating factor in the sentencing phase or , more simply , by placing the aggravating - factor determination ( where it logically belongs anyway ) in the guilt phase . There is really no way in which Justice Breyer can travel with the happy band that reaches todays result unless he says yes to Apprendi . Concisely put , Justice Breyer is on the wrong flight ; he should either get off before the doors close , or buy a ticket to Apprendi -land .	He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .	0

I add one further point , lest the holding of todays decision be confused by the separate concurrence . Justice Breyer , who refuses to accept Apprendi , see 530 U. S. , at 555 ( Breyer , J. , dissenting ) ; see also Harris v. United States , ante , p. _ _ _ ( Breyer , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) , nonetheless concurs in todays judgment because he believe[s ] that jury sentencing in capital cases is mandated by the Eighth Amendment. Post , at 1 ( opinion concurring in judgment ) . While I am , as always , pleased to travel in Justice B reyer s company , the unfortunate fact is that todays judgment has nothing to do with jury sentencing . What todays decision says is that the jury must find the existence of the fact that an aggravating factor existed . Those States that leave the ultimate life - or - death decision to the judge may continue to do soby requiring a prior jury finding of aggravating factor in the sentencing phase or , more simply , by placing the aggravating - factor determination ( where it logically belongs anyway ) in the guilt phase . There is really no way in which Justice Breyer can travel with the happy band that reaches todays result unless he says yes to Apprendi . Concisely put , Justice Breyer is on the wrong flight ; he should either get off before the doors close , or buy a ticket to Apprendi -land .	No state shall enter into any treaty , alliance , or confederation ; grant letters of marque and reprisal ; coin money ; emit bills of credit ; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts ; pass any bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or law impairing the obligation of contracts , or grant any title of nobility .

No state shall , without the consent of Congress , lay any duty of tonnage , keep troops , or ships of war in time of peace , enter into any agreement or compact with another state , or with a foreign power , or engage in war , unless actually invaded , or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay .	0

The question whether Walton v. Arizona , 497 U. S. 639 ( 1990 ) , survives our decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U. S. 466 ( 2000 ) , confronts me with a difficult choice . What compelled Arizona ( and many other States ) to specify particular aggravating factors that must be found before the death penalty can be imposed , see 1973 Ariz. Sess . Laws ch . 138 , § 5 ( originally codified as Ariz. Rev. Stat . § 13454 ) , was the line of this Courts cases beginning with Furman v. Georgia , 408 U. S. 238 ( 1972 ) ( per curiam ) . See Walton , 497 U. S. , at 659660 ( Scalia , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) . In my view , that line of decisions had no proper foundation in the Constitution . Id. , at 670 (  [T]he prohibition of the Eighth Amendment relates to the character of the punishment , and not to the process by which it is imposed  ( quoting Gardner v. Florida , 430 U. S. 349 , 371 ( 1977 ) ( R ehnquist , J. , dissenting ) ) ) . I am therefore reluctant to magnify the burdens that our Furman jurisprudence imposes on the States . Better for the Court to have invented an evidentiary requirement that a judge can find by a preponderance of the evidence , than to invent one that a unanimous jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt .	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each state , excluding Indians not taxed . But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof . But Congress may by a vote of two - thirds of each House , remove such disability . The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law , including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion , shall not be questioned . But neither the United States nor any state shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States , or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave ; but all such debts , obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void .

Better for the Court to have invented an evidentiary requirement that a judge can find by a preponderance of the evidence , than to invent one that a unanimous jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt .	The judicial power of the United States , shall be vested in one Supreme Court , and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish . The judges , both of the supreme and inferior courts , shall hold their offices during good behaviour , and shall , at stated times , receive for their services , a compensation , which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office . The judicial power shall extend to all cases , in law and equity , arising under this Constitution , the laws of the United States , and treaties made , or which shall be made , under their authority ;-- to all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls ;-- to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ;-- to controversies to which the United States shall be a party ;-- to controversies between two or more states ;-- between a state and citizens of another state ;-- between citizens of different states ;-- between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states , and between a state , or the citizens thereof , and foreign states , citizens or subjects . In all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , and those in which a state shall be party , the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction . In all the other cases before mentioned , the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction , both as to law and fact , with such exceptions , and under such regulations as the Congress shall make . The trial of all crimes , except in cases of impeachment , shall be by jury ; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed ; but when not committed within any state , the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed . Treason against the United States , shall consist only in levying war against them , or in adhering to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort . No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act , or on confession in open court . The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason , but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood , or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted .	0
On the other hand , as I wrote in my dissent in Almendarez - Torres v. United States , 523 U. S. 224 , 248 ( 1998 ) , and as I reaffirmed by joining the opinion for the Court in Apprendi , I believe that the fundamental meaning of the jury - trial guarantee of the Sixth Amendment is that all facts essential to imposition of the level of punishment that the defendant receiveswhether the statute calls them elements of the offense , sentencing factors , or Mary Janemust be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt .	A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed .	0

All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives . The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states , and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature . No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty five years , and been seven years a citizen of the United States , and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen . Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union , according to their respective numbers , which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons , including those bound to service for a term of years , and excluding Indians not taxed , three fifths of all other Persons . The actual Enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States , and within every subsequent term of ten years , in such manner as they shall by law direct . The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand , but each state shall have at least one Representative ; and until such enumeration shall be made , the state of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three , Massachusetts eight , Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one , Connecticut five , New York six , New Jersey four , Pennsylvania eight , Delaware one , Maryland six , Virginia ten , North Carolina five , South Carolina five , and Georgia three . When vacancies happen in the Representation from any state , the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies . The House of Representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers ; and shall have the sole power of impeachment . The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state , chosen by the legislature thereof , for six years ; and each Senator shall have one vote . Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election , they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes . The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen by resignation , or otherwise , during the recess of the legislature of any state , the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature , which shall then fill such vacancies . No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years , and been nine years a citizen of the United States and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen . The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate , but shall have no vote , unless they be equally divided . The Senate shall choose their other officers , and also a President pro tempore , in the absence of the Vice President , or when he shall exercise the office of President of the United States . The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments . When sitting for that purpose , they shall be on oath or affirmation . When the President of the United States is tried , the Chief Justice shall preside : And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present . Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office , and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor , trust or profit under the United States : but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment , trial , judgment and punishment , according to law . The times , places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives , shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof ; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations , except as to the places of choosing Senators . The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year , and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December , unless they shall by law appoint a different day . Each House shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members , and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business ; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day , and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members , in such manner , and under such penalties as each House may provide . Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings , punish its members for disorderly behavior , and , with the concurrence of two thirds , expel a member . Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings , and from time to time publish the same , excepting such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy ; and the yeas and nays of the members of either House on any question shall , at the desire of one fifth of those present , be entered on the journal . Neither House , during the session of Congress , shall , without the consent of the other , adjourn for more than three days , nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting . The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services , to be ascertained by law , and paid out of the treasury of the United States . They shall in all cases , except treason , felony and breach of the peace , be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same ; and for any speech or debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other place . No Senator or Representative shall , during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time : and no person holding any office under the United States , shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office . All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it become a law , be presented to the President of the United States ; if he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it . If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law . But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays , and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively . If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall have been presented to him , the same shall be a law , in like manner as if he had signed it , unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return , in which case it shall not be a law . Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill . The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises , to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States ; but all duties , imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States ; To borrow money on the credit of the United States ; To regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several states , and with the Indian tribes ; To establish a uniform rule of naturalization , and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States ; To coin money , regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin , and fix the standard of weights and measures ; To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States ; To establish post offices and post roads ; To promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries ; To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court ; To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas , and offenses against the law of nations ; To declare war , grant letters of marque and reprisal , and make rules concerning captures on land and water ; To raise and support armies , but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years ; To provide and maintain a navy ; To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces ; To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union , suppress insurrections and repel invasions ; To provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining , the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , reserving to the states respectively , the appointment of the officers , and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress ; To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten miles square ) as may , by cession of particular states , and the acceptance of Congress , become the seat of the government of the United States , and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be , for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , dockyards , and other needful buildings ;-- And To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof . The migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit , shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight , but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation , not exceeding ten dollars for each person . The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended , unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it . No bill of attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed . No capitation , or other direct , tax shall be laid , unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken . No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state . No preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one state over those of another : nor shall vessels bound to , or from , one state , be obliged to enter , clear or pay duties in another . No money shall be drawn from the treasury , but in consequence of appropriations made by law ; and a regular statement and account of receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time . No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States : and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them , shall , without the consent of the Congress , accept of any present , emolument , office , or title , of any kind whatever , from any king , prince , or foreign state . No state shall enter into any treaty , alliance , or confederation ; grant letters of marque and reprisal ; coin money ; emit bills of credit ; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts ; pass any bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or law impairing the obligation of contracts , or grant any title of nobility .

The quandary is apparent : Should I continue to apply the last - stated principle when I know that the only reason the fact is essential is that this Court has mistakenly said that the Constitution requires state law to impose such aggravating factors ? In Walton , to tell the truth , the Sixth Amendment claim was not put with the clarity it obtained in Almendarez - Torres and Apprendi . There what the appellant argued had to be found by the jury was not all facts essential to imposition of the death penalty , but rather  every finding of fact underlying the sentencing decision, including not only the aggravating factors without which the penalty could not be imposed , but also the mitigating factors that might induce a sentencer to give a lesser punishment . 497 U. S. , at 647 ( emphasis added ) . But even if the point had been put with greater clarity in Walton , I think I still would have approved the Arizona schemeI would have favored the States freedom to develop their own capital sentencing procedures ( already erroneously abridged by Furman ) over the logic of the Apprendi principle .	No law , varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives , shall take effect , until an election of Representatives shall have intervened .	0

I add one further point , lest the holding of todays decision be confused by the separate concurrence . Justice Breyer , who refuses to accept Apprendi , see 530 U. S. , at 555 ( Breyer , J. , dissenting ) ; see also Harris v. United States , ante , p. _ _ _ ( Breyer , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) , nonetheless concurs in todays judgment because he believe[s ] that jury sentencing in capital cases is mandated by the Eighth Amendment. Post , at 1 ( opinion concurring in judgment ) . While I am , as always , pleased to travel in Justice B reyer s company , the unfortunate fact is that todays judgment has nothing to do with jury sentencing . What todays decision says is that the jury must find the existence of the fact that an aggravating factor existed . Those States that leave the ultimate life - or - death decision to the judge may continue to do soby requiring a prior jury finding of aggravating factor in the sentencing phase or , more simply , by placing the aggravating - factor determination ( where it logically belongs anyway ) in the guilt phase . There is really no way in which Justice Breyer can travel with the happy band that reaches todays result unless he says yes to Apprendi . Concisely put , Justice Breyer is on the wrong flight ; he should either get off before the doors close , or buy a ticket to Apprendi -land .

I add one further point , lest the holding of todays decision be confused by the separate concurrence . Justice Breyer , who refuses to accept Apprendi , see 530 U. S. , at 555 ( Breyer , J. , dissenting ) ; see also Harris v. United States , ante , p. _ _ _ ( Breyer , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) , nonetheless concurs in todays judgment because he believe[s ] that jury sentencing in capital cases is mandated by the Eighth Amendment. Post , at 1 ( opinion concurring in judgment ) . While I am , as always , pleased to travel in Justice B reyer s company , the unfortunate fact is that todays judgment has nothing to do with jury sentencing . What todays decision says is that the jury must find the existence of the fact that an aggravating factor existed . Those States that leave the ultimate life - or - death decision to the judge may continue to do soby requiring a prior jury finding of aggravating factor in the sentencing phase or , more simply , by placing the aggravating - factor determination ( where it logically belongs anyway ) in the guilt phase . There is really no way in which Justice Breyer can travel with the happy band that reaches todays result unless he says yes to Apprendi . Concisely put , Justice Breyer is on the wrong flight ; he should either get off before the doors close , or buy a ticket to Apprendi -land .	In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation , the Vice President shall become President . Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President , the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress . Whenever the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office , and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary , such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President . Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide , transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office , the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President . Thereafter , when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists , he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide , transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office . Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue , assembling within forty - eight hours for that purpose if not in session . If the Congress , within twenty - one days after receipt of the latter written declaration , or , if Congress is not in session , within twenty - one days after Congress is required to assemble , determines by two - thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office , the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President ; otherwise , the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office .	0
The question whether Walton v. Arizona , 497 U. S. 639 ( 1990 ) , survives our decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U. S. 466 ( 2000 ) , confronts me with a difficult choice . What compelled Arizona ( and many other States ) to specify particular aggravating factors that must be found before the death penalty can be imposed , see 1973 Ariz. Sess . Laws ch . 138 , § 5 ( originally codified as Ariz. Rev. Stat . § 13454 ) , was the line of this Courts cases beginning with Furman v. Georgia , 408 U. S. 238 ( 1972 ) ( per curiam ) . See Walton , 497 U. S. , at 659660 ( Scalia , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) . In my view , that line of decisions had no proper foundation in the Constitution . Id. , at 670 (  [T]he prohibition of the Eighth Amendment relates to the character of the punishment , and not to the process by which it is imposed  ( quoting Gardner v. Florida , 430 U. S. 349 , 371 ( 1977 ) ( R ehnquist , J. , dissenting ) ) ) . I am therefore reluctant to magnify the burdens that our Furman jurisprudence imposes on the States . Better for the Court to have invented an evidentiary requirement that a judge can find by a preponderance of the evidence , than to invent one that a unanimous jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt .	The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state , or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state .	0

On the other hand , as I wrote in my dissent in Almendarez - Torres v. United States , 523 U.

Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other state .

The quandary is apparent : Should I continue to apply the last - stated principle when I know that the only reason the fact is essential is that this Court has mistakenly said that the Constitution requires state law to impose such aggravating factors ? In Walton , to tell the truth , the Sixth Amendment claim was not put with the clarity it obtained in Almendarez - Torres and Apprendi . There what the appellant argued had to be found by the jury was not all facts essential to imposition of the death penalty , but rather  every finding of fact underlying the sentencing decision, including not only the aggravating factors without which the penalty could not be imposed , but also the mitigating factors that might induce a sentencer to give a lesser punishment . 497 U. S. , at 647 ( emphasis added ) . But even if the point had been put with greater clarity in Walton , I think I still would have approved the Arizona schemeI would have favored the States freedom to develop their own capital sentencing procedures ( already erroneously abridged by Furman ) over the logic of the Apprendi principle .	No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice , and no person who has held the office of President , or acted as President , for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once .

This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three - fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states by the Congress .	0

The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate .

But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them .

He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0

I add one further point , lest the holding of todays decision be confused by the separate concurrence . Justice Breyer , who refuses to accept Apprendi , see 530 U. S. , at 555 ( Breyer , J. , dissenting ) ; see also Harris v. United States , ante , p. _ _ _ ( Breyer , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) , nonetheless concurs in todays judgment because he believe[s ] that jury sentencing in capital cases is mandated by the Eighth Amendment. Post , at 1 ( opinion concurring in judgment ) . While I am , as always , pleased to travel in Justice B reyer s company , the unfortunate fact is that todays judgment has nothing to do with jury sentencing . What todays decision says is that the jury must find the existence of the fact that an aggravating factor existed . Those States that leave the ultimate life - or - death decision to the judge may continue to do soby requiring a prior jury finding of aggravating factor in the sentencing phase or , more simply , by placing the aggravating - factor determination ( where it logically belongs anyway ) in the guilt phase . There is really no way in which Justice Breyer can travel with the happy band that reaches todays result unless he says yes to Apprendi . Concisely put , Justice Breyer is on the wrong flight ; he should either get off before the doors close , or buy a ticket to Apprendi -land .	The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people .	0

The question whether Walton v. Arizona , 497 U. S. 639 ( 1990 ) , survives our decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U. S. 466 ( 2000 ) , confronts me with a difficult choice . What compelled Arizona ( and many other States ) to specify particular aggravating factors that must be found before the death penalty can be imposed , see 1973 Ariz. Sess . Laws ch . 138 , § 5 ( originally codified as Ariz. Rev. Stat . § 13454 ) , was the line of this Courts cases beginning with Furman v. Georgia , 408 U. S. 238 ( 1972 ) ( per curiam ) .

The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves .

But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President .

The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected .

The question whether Walton v. Arizona , 497 U. S. 639 ( 1990 ) , survives our decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U. S. 466 ( 2000 ) , confronts me with a difficult choice . What compelled Arizona ( and many other States ) to specify particular aggravating factors that must be found before the death penalty can be imposed , see 1973 Ariz. Sess . Laws ch . 138 , § 5 ( originally codified as Ariz. Rev. Stat . § 13454 ) , was the line of this Courts cases beginning with Furman v. Georgia , 408 U. S. 238 ( 1972 ) ( per curiam ) . See Walton , 497 U. S. , at 659660 ( Scalia , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) . In my view , that line of decisions had no proper foundation in the Constitution .

S. 349 , 371 ( 1977 ) ( R ehnquist , J. , dissenting ) ) ) . I am therefore reluctant to magnify the burdens that our Furman jurisprudence imposes on the States .

And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts , records , and proceedings shall be proved , and the effect thereof . The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states . A person charged in any state with treason , felony , or other crime , who shall flee from justice , and be found in another state , shall on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled , be delivered up , to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime . No person held to service or labor in one state , under the laws thereof , escaping into another , shall , in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due . New states may be admitted by the Congress into this union ; but no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state ; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states , or parts of states , without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress . The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States ; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States , or of any particular state .

I add one further point , lest the holding of todays decision be confused by the separate concurrence . Justice Breyer , who refuses to accept Apprendi , see 530 U.

While I am , as always , pleased to travel in Justice B reyer s company , the unfortunate fact is that todays judgment has nothing to do with jury sentencing . What todays decision says is that the jury must find the existence of the fact that an aggravating factor existed . Those States that leave the ultimate life - or - death decision to the judge may continue to do soby requiring a prior jury finding of aggravating factor in the sentencing phase or , more simply , by placing the aggravating - factor determination ( where it logically belongs anyway ) in the guilt phase . There is really no way in which Justice Breyer can travel with the happy band that reaches todays result unless he says yes to Apprendi . Concisely put , Justice Breyer is on the wrong flight ; he should either get off before the doors close , or buy a ticket to Apprendi -land .

Those States that leave the ultimate life - or - death decision to the judge may continue to do soby requiring a prior jury finding of aggravating factor in the sentencing phase or , more simply , by placing the aggravating - factor determination ( where it logically belongs anyway ) in the guilt phase . There is really no way in which Justice Breyer can travel with the happy band that reaches todays result unless he says yes to Apprendi . Concisely put , Justice Breyer is on the wrong flight ; he should either get off before the doors close , or buy a ticket to Apprendi -land .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	0
First Amendment rights are all too often sacrificed for the sake of transparency in federal and state elections . “ ‘ Sunlight,’ ” this Court has noted , is “ ‘ the best of disinfectants’ ” in elections . See Buckley v. Valeo , 424 U. S. 1 , 67 ( 1976 ) ( per curiam ) ( quoting L. Brandeis , Other People ’s Money 62 ( 1933 ) ) . But that is not so when “ ‘ sunlight’ ” chills speech by exposing anonymous donors to harassment and threats of reprisal . See Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm’n , 558 U. S. 310 , 482–484 ( 2010 ) ( Thomas , J. , concurring in part and dissenting in part ) ; see also , e.g. , NAACP v. Alabama ex rel . Patterson , 357 U. S. 449 , 462–463 ( 1958 ) . This case presents the opportunity to clarify that the State ’s interest in transparency does not always trump First Amendment rights . I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari .	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .	1

In my view , it is time for the Court to reconsider whether a State ’s interest in an informed electorate can ever jus - tify the disclosure of otherwise anonymous donor rolls .

S. , at 462 ( noting that disclosure of members’ names would expose them “ to economic reprisal , loss of employment , threat of physical coercion , and other manifestations of public hostility ” ) .

The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .

In my view , the purported government interest in an informed electorate can not justify the First Amendment burdens that disclosure requirements impose .

In my view , the purported government interest in an informed electorate can not justify the First Amendment burdens that disclosure requirements impose . See Citizens United , supra , at 483 ( opinion of Thomas , J. ) . But if the Court is determined to stand by its “ exacting scrutiny ” test , then this case is its proving ground . By refusing to review the constitutionality of the Delaware law , the Court sends a strong message that “ exacting scrutiny ” means no scrutiny at all . I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari .	The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state , or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state .	0

The Fourth Amendment does not , therefore , prevent all investigations conducted on private property ; for example , an officer may ( subject to Katz ) gather information in what we have called “ open fields”—even if those fields are privately owned — because such fields are not enumerated in the Amendment ’s text . Hester v. United States , 265 U. S. 57 ( 1924 ) .	In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation , the Vice President shall become President . Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President , the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress . Whenever the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office , and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary , such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President . Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide , transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office , the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President . Thereafter , when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists , he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide , transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office . Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue , assembling within forty - eight hours for that purpose if not in session . If the Congress , within twenty - one days after receipt of the latter written declaration , or , if Congress is not in session , within twenty - one days after Congress is required to assemble , determines by two - thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office , the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President ; otherwise , the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office .	0

The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0

Treason against the United States , shall consist only in levying war against them , or in adhering to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort . No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act , or on confession in open court .

Just last Term , we considered an argument much like this . Jones held that tracking an automobile ’s where - abouts using a physically - mounted GPS receiver is a Fourth Amendment search . The Government argued that the Katz standard “ show[ed ] that no search occurred , ” as the defendant had “ no ‘ reasonable expectation of privacy’ ” in his whereabouts on the public roads , Jones , 565 U. S. , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 5)—a proposition with at least as much support in our case law as the one the State marshals here . See , e.g. , United States v. Knotts , 460 U. S. 276 , 278 ( 1983 ) . But because the GPS receiver had been physically mounted on the defendant ’s automobile ( thus intruding on his “ effects ” ) , we held that tracking the vehicle ’s movements was a search : a person ’s “ Fourth Amendment rights do not rise or fall with the Katz formulation . ” Jones , supra , at _ _ _ ( slip op . , at 5 ) .

Where is the authority evidencing such a rule ?

According to the Court , however , the police officer in this case , Detective Bartelt , committed a trespass because he was accompanied during his otherwise lawful visit to the front door of respondent ’s house by his dog , Franky . Where is the authority evidencing such a rule ? Dogs have been domesticated for about 12,000 years ; 1 they were ubiquitous in both this country and Britain at the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment ; 2 and their acute sense of smell has been used in law enforcement for centuries . 3 Yet the Court has been unable to find a single case — from the United States or any other common - law nation — that supports the rule on which its decision is based . Thus , trespass law provides no support for the Court ’s holding today .	The Congress , whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary , shall propose amendments to this Constitution , or , on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states , shall call a convention for proposing amendments , which , in either case , shall be valid to all intents and purposes , as part of this Constitution , when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states , or by conventions in three fourths thereof , as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress ; provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article ; and that no state , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate .	0

After Rodney Gant was arrested for driving with a suspended license , handcuffed , and locked in the back of a patrol car , police officers searched his car and discovered cocaine in the pocket of a jacket on the backseat .

California , 395 U. S. 752 ( 1969 ) , and applied to vehicle searches in New York v. Belton , 453 U. S. 454 ( 1981 ) , did not justify the search in this case . We agree with that conclusion .

The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate .

After Rodney Gant was arrested for driving with a suspended license , handcuffed , and locked in the back of a patrol car , police officers searched his car and discovered cocaine in the pocket of a jacket on the backseat . Because Gant could not have accessed his car to retrieve weapons or evidence at the time of the search , the Arizona Supreme Court held that the search - incident - to - arrest exception to the Fourth Amendments warrant requirement , as defined in Chimel v. California , 395 U. S. 752 ( 1969 ) , and applied to vehicle searches in New York v. Belton , 453 U. S. 454 ( 1981 ) , did not justify the search in this case . We agree with that conclusion .	The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes , from whatever source derived , without apportionment among the several states , and without regard to any census or enumeration .	0
Gant was charged with two offensespossession of a narcotic drug for sale and possession of drug paraphernalia ( i.e. , the plastic bag in which the cocaine was found ) . He moved to suppress the evidence seized from his car on the ground that the warrantless search violated the Fourth Amendment . Among other things , Gant argued that Belton did not authorize the search of his vehicle because he posed no threat to the officers after he was handcuffed in the patrol car and because he was arrested for a traffic offense for which no evidence could be found in his vehicle . When asked at the suppression hearing why the search was conducted , Officer Griffith responded : Because the law says we can do it. App . 75 .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	1

After protracted state - court proceedings , the Arizona Supreme Court concluded that the search of Gants car was unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment .

He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .

For several reasons , we reject the States argument . First , the State seriously undervalues the privacy interests at stake . Although we have recognized that a motorists privacy interest in his vehicle is less substantial than in his home , see New York v. Class , 475 U. S. 106 , 112113 ( 1986 ) , the former interest is nevertheless important and deserving of constitutional protection , see Knowles , 525 U. S. , at 117 . It is particularly significant that Belton searches authorize police officers to search not just the passenger compartment but every purse , briefcase , or other container within that space . A rule that gives police the power to conduct such a search whenever an individual is caught committing a traffic offense , when there is no basis for believing evidence of the offense might be found in the vehicle , creates a serious and recurring threat to the privacy of countless individuals . Indeed , the character of that threat implicates the central concern underlying the Fourth Amendmentthe concern about giving police officers unbridled discretion to rummage at will among a persons private effects . 5	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	1

Indeed , the character of that threat implicates the central concern underlying the Fourth Amendmentthe concern about giving police officers unbridled discretion to rummage at will among a persons private effects . 5	All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each state , excluding Indians not taxed . But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any state , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof . But Congress may by a vote of two - thirds of each House , remove such disability . The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law , including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion , shall not be questioned . But neither the United States nor any state shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States , or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave ; but all such debts , obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void . The Congress shall have power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article .	0
For several reasons , we reject the States argument . First , the State seriously undervalues the privacy interests at stake . Although we have recognized that a motorists privacy interest in his vehicle is less substantial than in his home , see New York v. Class , 475 U. S. 106 , 112113 ( 1986 ) , the former interest is nevertheless important and deserving of constitutional protection , see Knowles , 525 U. S. , at 117 . It is particularly significant that Belton searches authorize police officers to search not just the passenger compartment but every purse , briefcase , or other container within that space . A rule that gives police the power to conduct such a search whenever an individual is caught committing a traffic offense , when there is no basis for believing evidence of the offense might be found in the vehicle , creates a serious and recurring threat to the privacy of countless individuals . Indeed , the character of that threat implicates the central concern underlying the Fourth Amendmentthe concern about giving police officers unbridled discretion to rummage at will among a persons private effects . 5	New states may be admitted by the Congress into this union ; but no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state ; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states , or parts of states , without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress . The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States ; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States , or of any particular state .	0
Contrary to the States suggestion , a broad reading of Belton is also unnecessary to protect law enforcement safety and evidentiary interests . Under our view , Belton and Thornton permit an officer to conduct a vehicle search when an arrestee is within reaching distance of the vehicle or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest . Other established exceptions to the warrant requirement authorize a vehicle search under additional circumstances when safety or evidentiary concerns demand . For instance , Michigan v. Long , 463 U. S. 1032 ( 1983 ) , permits an officer to search a vehicles passenger compartment when he has reasonable suspicion that an individual , whether or not the arrestee , is dangerous and might access the vehicle to gain immediate control of weapons. Id. , at 1049 ( citing Terry v. Ohio , 392 U. S. 1 , 21 ( 1968 ) ) . If there is probable cause to believe a vehicle contains evidence of criminal activity , United States v. Ross , 456 U. S. 798 , 820821 ( 1982 ) , authorizes a search of any area of the vehicle in which the evidence might be found . Unlike the searches permitted by Justice Scalias opinion concurring in the judgment in Thornton , which we conclude today are reasonable for purposes of the Fourth Amendment , Ross allows searches for evidence relevant to offenses other than the offense of arrest , and the scope of the search authorized is broader . Finally , there may be still other circumstances in which safety or evidentiary interests would justify a search . Cf . Maryland v. Buie , 494 U. S. 325 , 334 ( 1990 ) ( holding that , incident to arrest , an officer may conduct a limited protective sweep of those areas of a house in which he reasonably suspects a dangerous person may be hiding ) .	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	1

These exceptions together ensure that officers may search a vehicle when genuine safety or evidentiary concerns encountered during the arrest of a vehicles recent occupant justify a search . Construing Belton broadly to allow vehicle searches incident to any arrest would serve no purpose except to provide a police entitlement , and it is anathema to the Fourth Amendment to permit a warrantless search on that basis . For these reasons , we are unpersuaded by the States arguments that a broad reading of Belton would meaningfully further law enforcement interests and justify a substantial intrusion on individuals privacy . 8	The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .	1

The actual Enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States , and within every subsequent term of ten years , in such manner as they shall by law direct .

The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen by resignation , or otherwise , during the recess of the legislature of any state , the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature , which shall then fill such vacancies . No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years , and been nine years a citizen of the United States and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen . The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate , but shall have no vote , unless they be equally divided .

No Senator or Representative shall , during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time : and no person holding any office under the United States , shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office . All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it become a law , be presented to the President of the United States ; if he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it . If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law . But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays , and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively .

We do not agree with the contention in Justice Alitos dissent ( hereinafter dissent ) that consideration of police reliance interests requires a different result . Although it appears that the States reading of Belton has been widely taught in police academies and that law enforcement officers have relied on the rule in conducting vehicle searches during the past 28 years , 11 many of these searches were not justified by the reasons underlying the Chimel exception . Countless individuals guilty of nothing more serious than a traffic violation have had their constitutional right to the security of their private effects violated as a result . The fact that the law enforcement community may view the States version of the Belton rule as an entitlement does not establish the sort of reliance interest that could outweigh the countervailing interest that all individuals share in having their constitutional rights fully protected . If it is clear that a practice is unlawful , individuals interest in its discontinuance clearly outweighs any law enforcement entitlement to its persistence . Cf . Mincey v. Arizona , 437 U. S. 385 , 393 ( 1978 ) ( [T]he mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the Fourth Amendment ) .

Although it appears that the States reading of Belton has been widely taught in police academies and that law enforcement officers have relied on the rule in conducting vehicle searches during the past 28 years , 11 many of these searches were not justified by the reasons underlying the Chimel exception . Countless individuals guilty of nothing more serious than a traffic violation have had their constitutional right to the security of their private effects violated as a result . The fact that the law enforcement community may view the States version of the Belton rule as an entitlement does not establish the sort of reliance interest that could outweigh the countervailing interest that all individuals share in having their constitutional rights fully protected . If it is clear that a practice is unlawful , individuals interest in its discontinuance clearly outweighs any law enforcement entitlement to its persistence . Cf . Mincey v. Arizona , 437 U. S. 385 , 393 ( 1978 ) ( [T]he mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the Fourth Amendment ) . The dissents reference in this regard to the reliance interests cited in Dickerson v. United States , 530 U. S. 428 ( 2000 ) , is misplaced . See post , at 5 . In observing that Miranda has become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture, 530 U. S. , at 443 , the Court was referring not to policereliance on a rule requiring them to provide warnings but to the broader societal reliance on that individual right .	The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people .	0
After Rodney Gant was arrested for driving with a suspended license , handcuffed , and locked in the back of a patrol car , police officers searched his car and discovered cocaine in the pocket of a jacket on the backseat . Because Gant could not have accessed his car to retrieve weapons or evidence at the time of the search , the Arizona Supreme Court held that the search - incident - to - arrest exception to the Fourth Amendments warrant requirement , as defined in Chimel v. California , 395 U. S. 752 ( 1969 ) , and applied to vehicle searches in New York v. Belton , 453 U. S. 454 ( 1981 ) , did not justify the search in this case . We agree with that conclusion .	The times , places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives , shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof ; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations , except as to the places of choosing Senators . The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year , and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December , unless they shall by law appoint a different day .	0

Gant was charged with two offensespossession of a narcotic drug for sale and possession of drug paraphernalia ( i.e. , the plastic bag in which the cocaine was found ) . He moved to suppress the evidence seized from his car on the ground that the warrantless search violated the Fourth Amendment . Among other things , Gant argued that Belton did not authorize the search of his vehicle because he posed no threat to the officers after he was handcuffed in the patrol car and because he was arrested for a traffic offense for which no evidence could be found in his vehicle . When asked at the suppression hearing why the search was conducted , Officer Griffith responded : Because the law says we can do it. App . 75 .	The judicial power of the United States , shall be vested in one Supreme Court , and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish .

After protracted state - court proceedings , the Arizona Supreme Court concluded that the search of Gants car was unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment . The courts opinion discussed at length our decision in Belton , which held that police may search the passenger compartment of a vehicle and any containers therein as a contemporaneous incident of an arrest of the vehicles recent occupant . 216 Ariz. 1 , 34 , 162 P. 3d 640 , 642643 ( 2007 ) ( citing 453 U. S. , at 460 ) . The court distinguished Belton as a case concerning the permissible scope of a vehicle search incident to arrest and concluded that it did not answer the threshold question whether the police may conduct a search incident to arrest at all once the scene is secure. 216 Ariz. , at 4 , 162 P. 3d , at 643 . Relying on our earlier decision in Chimel , the court observed that the search - incident - to - arrest exception to the warrant requirement is justified by interests in officer safety and evidence preservation . 216 Ariz. , at 4 , 162 P. 3d , at 643 . When the justifications underlying Chimel no longer exist because the scene is secure and the arrestee is handcuffed , secured in the back of a patrol car , and under the supervision of an officer, the court concluded , a warrantless search of the arrestees car can not be justified as necessary to protect the officers at the scene or prevent the destruction of evidence. Id. , at 5 , 162 P. 3d , at 644 . Accordingly , the court held that the search of Gants car was unreasonable .	All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives . The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states , and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature .

The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen by resignation , or otherwise , during the recess of the legislature of any state , the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature , which shall then fill such vacancies . No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years , and been nine years a citizen of the United States and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen . The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate , but shall have no vote , unless they be equally divided .

Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings , punish its members for disorderly behavior , and , with the concurrence of two thirds , expel a member . Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings , and from time to time publish the same , excepting such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy ; and the yeas and nays of the members of either House on any question shall , at the desire of one fifth of those present , be entered on the journal . Neither House , during the session of Congress , shall , without the consent of the other , adjourn for more than three days , nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting . The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services , to be ascertained by law , and paid out of the treasury of the United States . They shall in all cases , except treason , felony and breach of the peace , be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same ; and for any speech or debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other place . No Senator or Representative shall , during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time : and no person holding any office under the United States , shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office . All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it become a law , be presented to the President of the United States ; if he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it . If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law . But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays , and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively . If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall have been presented to him , the same shall be a law , in like manner as if he had signed it , unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return , in which case it shall not be a law . Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill . The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises , to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States ; but all duties , imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States ; To borrow money on the credit of the United States ; To regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several states , and with the Indian tribes ; To establish a uniform rule of naturalization , and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States ; To coin money , regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin , and fix the standard of weights and measures ; To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States ; To establish post offices and post roads ; To promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries ; To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court ; To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas , and offenses against the law of nations ; To declare war , grant letters of marque and reprisal , and make rules concerning captures on land and water ; To raise and support armies , but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years ; To provide and maintain a navy ; To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces ; To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union , suppress insurrections and repel invasions ; To provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining , the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , reserving to the states respectively , the appointment of the officers , and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress ; To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten miles square ) as may , by cession of particular states , and the acceptance of Congress , become the seat of the government of the United States , and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be , for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , dockyards , and other needful buildings ;-- And To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof .

Consistent with our precedent , our analysis begins , as it should in every case addressing the reasonableness of a warrantless search , with the basic rule that searches conducted outside the judicial process , without prior approval by judge or magistrate , are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendmentsubject only to a few specifically established and well - delineated exceptions. Katz v.

For several reasons , we reject the States argument . First , the State seriously undervalues the privacy interests at stake . Although we have recognized that a motorists privacy interest in his vehicle is less substantial than in his home , see New York v. Class , 475 U. S. 106 , 112113 ( 1986 ) , the former interest is nevertheless important and deserving of constitutional protection , see Knowles , 525 U. S. , at 117 . It is particularly significant that Belton searches authorize police officers to search not just the passenger compartment but every purse , briefcase , or other container within that space . A rule that gives police the power to conduct such a search whenever an individual is caught committing a traffic offense , when there is no basis for believing evidence of the offense might be found in the vehicle , creates a serious and recurring threat to the privacy of countless individuals . Indeed , the character of that threat implicates the central concern underlying the Fourth Amendmentthe concern about giving police officers unbridled discretion to rummage at will among a persons private effects . 5	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	0

Although we have recognized that a motorists privacy interest in his vehicle is less substantial than in his home , see New York v. Class , 475 U. S. 106 , 112113 ( 1986 ) , the former interest is nevertheless important and deserving of constitutional protection , see Knowles , 525 U. S. , at 117 . It is particularly significant that Belton searches authorize police officers to search not just the passenger compartment but every purse , briefcase , or other container within that space . A rule that gives police the power to conduct such a search whenever an individual is caught committing a traffic offense , when there is no basis for believing evidence of the offense might be found in the vehicle , creates a serious and recurring threat to the privacy of countless individuals . Indeed , the character of that threat implicates the central concern underlying the Fourth Amendmentthe concern about giving police officers unbridled discretion to rummage at will among a persons private effects . 5	He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States .	0

Contrary to the States suggestion , a broad reading of Belton is also unnecessary to protect law enforcement safety and evidentiary interests . Under our view , Belton and Thornton permit an officer to conduct a vehicle search when an arrestee is within reaching distance of the vehicle or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest . Other established exceptions to the warrant requirement authorize a vehicle search under additional circumstances when safety or evidentiary concerns demand . For instance , Michigan v. Long , 463 U. S. 1032 ( 1983 ) , permits an officer to search a vehicles passenger compartment when he has reasonable suspicion that an individual , whether or not the arrestee , is dangerous and might access the vehicle to gain immediate control of weapons. Id. , at 1049 ( citing Terry v. Ohio , 392 U. S. 1 , 21 ( 1968 ) ) . If there is probable cause to believe a vehicle contains evidence of criminal activity , United States v. Ross , 456 U. S. 798 , 820821 ( 1982 ) , authorizes a search of any area of the vehicle in which the evidence might be found . Unlike the searches permitted by Justice Scalias opinion concurring in the judgment in Thornton , which we conclude today are reasonable for purposes of the Fourth Amendment , Ross allows searches for evidence relevant to offenses other than the offense of arrest , and the scope of the search authorized is broader . Finally , there may be still other circumstances in which safety or evidentiary interests would justify a search . Cf . Maryland v. Buie , 494 U. S. 325 , 334 ( 1990 ) ( holding that , incident to arrest , an officer may conduct a limited protective sweep of those areas of a house in which he reasonably suspects a dangerous person may be hiding ) .

These exceptions together ensure that officers may search a vehicle when genuine safety or evidentiary concerns encountered during the arrest of a vehicles recent occupant justify a search .

We do not agree with the contention in Justice Alitos dissent ( hereinafter dissent ) that consideration of police reliance interests requires a different result . Although it appears that the States reading of Belton has been widely taught in police academies and that law enforcement officers have relied on the rule in conducting vehicle searches during the past 28 years , 11 many of these searches were not justified by the reasons underlying the Chimel exception . Countless individuals guilty of nothing more serious than a traffic violation have had their constitutional right to the security of their private effects violated as a result . The fact that the law enforcement community may view the States version of the Belton rule as an entitlement does not establish the sort of reliance interest that could outweigh the countervailing interest that all individuals share in having their constitutional rights fully protected . If it is clear that a practice is unlawful , individuals interest in its discontinuance clearly outweighs any law enforcement entitlement to its persistence . Cf . Mincey v. Arizona , 437 U. S. 385 , 393 ( 1978 ) ( [T]he mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the Fourth Amendment ) . The dissents reference in this regard to the reliance interests cited in Dickerson v. United States , 530 U. S. 428 ( 2000 ) , is misplaced . See post , at 5 . In observing that Miranda has become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture, 530 U. S. , at 443 , the Court was referring not to policereliance on a rule requiring them to provide warnings but to the broader societal reliance on that individual right .	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0

After Rodney Gant was arrested for driving with a suspended license , handcuffed , and locked in the back of a patrol car , police officers searched his car and discovered cocaine in the pocket of a jacket on the backseat . Because Gant could not have accessed his car to retrieve weapons or evidence at the time of the search , the Arizona Supreme Court held that the search - incident - to - arrest exception to the Fourth Amendments warrant requirement , as defined in Chimel v. California , 395 U. S. 752 ( 1969 ) , and applied to vehicle searches in New York v. Belton , 453 U. S. 454 ( 1981 ) , did not justify the search in this case . We agree with that conclusion .

Gant was charged with two offensespossession of a narcotic drug for sale and possession of drug paraphernalia ( i.e. , the plastic bag in which the cocaine was found ) . He moved to suppress the evidence seized from his car on the ground that the warrantless search violated the Fourth Amendment . Among other things , Gant argued that Belton did not authorize the search of his vehicle because he posed no threat to the officers after he was handcuffed in the patrol car and because he was arrested for a traffic offense for which no evidence could be found in his vehicle . When asked at the suppression hearing why the search was conducted , Officer Griffith responded : Because the law says we can do it. App . 75 .

After protracted state - court proceedings , the Arizona Supreme Court concluded that the search of Gants car was unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment . The courts opinion discussed at length our decision in Belton , which held that police may search the passenger compartment of a vehicle and any containers therein as a contemporaneous incident of an arrest of the vehicles recent occupant . 216 Ariz. 1 , 34 , 162 P. 3d 640 , 642643 ( 2007 ) ( citing 453 U.

The court distinguished Belton as a case concerning the permissible scope of a vehicle search incident to arrest and concluded that it did not answer the threshold question whether the police may conduct a search incident to arrest at all once the scene is secure. 216 Ariz. , at 4 , 162 P. 3d , at 643 .

The Congress may by law provide for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the House of Representatives may choose a President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them , and for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the Senate may choose a Vice President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them .

After protracted state - court proceedings , the Arizona Supreme Court concluded that the search of Gants car was unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment .

Consistent with our precedent , our analysis begins , as it should in every case addressing the reasonableness of a warrantless search , with the basic rule that searches conducted outside the judicial process , without prior approval by judge or magistrate , are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendmentsubject only to a few specifically established and well - delineated exceptions. Katz v.

For several reasons , we reject the States argument . First , the State seriously undervalues the privacy interests at stake . Although we have recognized that a motorists privacy interest in his vehicle is less substantial than in his home , see New York v. Class , 475 U. S. 106 , 112113 ( 1986 ) , the former interest is nevertheless important and deserving of constitutional protection , see Knowles , 525 U. S. , at 117 . It is particularly significant that Belton searches authorize police officers to search not just the passenger compartment but every purse , briefcase , or other container within that space . A rule that gives police the power to conduct such a search whenever an individual is caught committing a traffic offense , when there is no basis for believing evidence of the offense might be found in the vehicle , creates a serious and recurring threat to the privacy of countless individuals . Indeed , the character of that threat implicates the central concern underlying the Fourth Amendmentthe concern about giving police officers unbridled discretion to rummage at will among a persons private effects . 5	Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted .	0

Contrary to the States suggestion , a broad reading of Belton is also unnecessary to protect law enforcement safety and evidentiary interests . Under our view , Belton and Thornton permit an officer to conduct a vehicle search when an arrestee is within reaching distance of the vehicle or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest . Other established exceptions to the warrant requirement authorize a vehicle search under additional circumstances when safety or evidentiary concerns demand . For instance , Michigan v. Long , 463 U. S. 1032 ( 1983 ) , permits an officer to search a vehicles passenger compartment when he has reasonable suspicion that an individual , whether or not the arrestee , is dangerous and might access the vehicle to gain immediate control of weapons. Id. , at 1049 ( citing Terry v. Ohio , 392 U. S. 1 , 21 ( 1968 ) ) . If there is probable cause to believe a vehicle contains evidence of criminal activity , United States v. Ross , 456 U. S. 798 , 820821 ( 1982 ) , authorizes a search of any area of the vehicle in which the evidence might be found . Unlike the searches permitted by Justice Scalias opinion concurring in the judgment in Thornton , which we conclude today are reasonable for purposes of the Fourth Amendment , Ross allows searches for evidence relevant to offenses other than the offense of arrest , and the scope of the search authorized is broader . Finally , there may be still other circumstances in which safety or evidentiary interests would justify a search . Cf . Maryland v. Buie , 494 U. S. 325 , 334 ( 1990 ) ( holding that , incident to arrest , an officer may conduct a limited protective sweep of those areas of a house in which he reasonably suspects a dangerous person may be hiding ) .

But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States .

In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them .

These exceptions together ensure that officers may search a vehicle when genuine safety or evidentiary concerns encountered during the arrest of a vehicles recent occupant justify a search . Construing Belton broadly to allow vehicle searches incident to any arrest would serve no purpose except to provide a police entitlement , and it is anathema to the Fourth Amendment to permit a warrantless search on that basis .

We do not agree with the contention in Justice Alitos dissent ( hereinafter dissent ) that consideration of police reliance interests requires a different result . Although it appears that the States reading of Belton has been widely taught in police academies and that law enforcement officers have relied on the rule in conducting vehicle searches during the past 28 years , 11 many of these searches were not justified by the reasons underlying the Chimel exception . Countless individuals guilty of nothing more serious than a traffic violation have had their constitutional right to the security of their private effects violated as a result . The fact that the law enforcement community may view the States version of the Belton rule as an entitlement does not establish the sort of reliance interest that could outweigh the countervailing interest that all individuals share in having their constitutional rights fully protected . If it is clear that a practice is unlawful , individuals interest in its discontinuance clearly outweighs any law enforcement entitlement to its persistence . Cf . Mincey v. Arizona , 437 U. S. 385 , 393 ( 1978 ) ( [T]he mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the Fourth Amendment ) . The dissents reference in this regard to the reliance interests cited in Dickerson v. United States , 530 U. S. 428 ( 2000 ) , is misplaced . See post , at 5 . In observing that Miranda has become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture, 530 U. S. , at 443 , the Court was referring not to policereliance on a rule requiring them to provide warnings but to the broader societal reliance on that individual right .

Although it appears that the States reading of Belton has been widely taught in police academies and that law enforcement officers have relied on the rule in conducting vehicle searches during the past 28 years , 11 many of these searches were not justified by the reasons underlying the Chimel exception . Countless individuals guilty of nothing more serious than a traffic violation have had their constitutional right to the security of their private effects violated as a result . The fact that the law enforcement community may view the States version of the Belton rule as an entitlement does not establish the sort of reliance interest that could outweigh the countervailing interest that all individuals share in having their constitutional rights fully protected . If it is clear that a practice is unlawful , individuals interest in its discontinuance clearly outweighs any law enforcement entitlement to its persistence . Cf . Mincey v. Arizona , 437 U. S. 385 , 393 ( 1978 ) ( [T]he mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the Fourth Amendment ) . The dissents reference in this regard to the reliance interests cited in Dickerson v. United States , 530 U. S. 428 ( 2000 ) , is misplaced . See post , at 5 . In observing that Miranda has become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture, 530 U. S. , at 443 , the Court was referring not to policereliance on a rule requiring them to provide warnings but to the broader societal reliance on that individual right .	No law , varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives , shall take effect , until an election of Representatives shall have intervened .	0

After Rodney Gant was arrested for driving with a suspended license , handcuffed , and locked in the back of a patrol car , police officers searched his car and discovered cocaine in the pocket of a jacket on the backseat . Because Gant could not have accessed his car to retrieve weapons or evidence at the time of the search , the Arizona Supreme Court held that the search - incident - to - arrest exception to the Fourth Amendments warrant requirement , as defined in Chimel v. California , 395 U. S. 752 ( 1969 ) , and applied to vehicle searches in New York v. Belton , 453 U. S. 454 ( 1981 ) , did not justify the search in this case . We agree with that conclusion .	We the people of the United States , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America .	0

Gant was charged with two offensespossession of a narcotic drug for sale and possession of drug paraphernalia ( i.e. , the plastic bag in which the cocaine was found ) . He moved to suppress the evidence seized from his car on the ground that the warrantless search violated the Fourth Amendment . Among other things , Gant argued that Belton did not authorize the search of his vehicle because he posed no threat to the officers after he was handcuffed in the patrol car and because he was arrested for a traffic offense for which no evidence could be found in his vehicle . When asked at the suppression hearing why the search was conducted , Officer Griffith responded : Because the law says we can do it. App . 75 .	Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other state .

After protracted state - court proceedings , the Arizona Supreme Court concluded that the search of Gants car was unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment . The courts opinion discussed at length our decision in Belton , which held that police may search the passenger compartment of a vehicle and any containers therein as a contemporaneous incident of an arrest of the vehicles recent occupant . 216 Ariz. 1 , 34 , 162 P. 3d 640 , 642643 ( 2007 ) ( citing 453 U. S. , at 460 ) . The court distinguished Belton as a case concerning the permissible scope of a vehicle search incident to arrest and concluded that it did not answer the threshold question whether the police may conduct a search incident to arrest at all once the scene is secure. 216 Ariz. , at 4 , 162 P. 3d , at 643 . Relying on our earlier decision in Chimel , the court observed that the search - incident - to - arrest exception to the warrant requirement is justified by interests in officer safety and evidence preservation . 216 Ariz. , at 4 , 162 P. 3d , at 643 . When the justifications underlying Chimel no longer exist because the scene is secure and the arrestee is handcuffed , secured in the back of a patrol car , and under the supervision of an officer, the court concluded , a warrantless search of the arrestees car can not be justified as necessary to protect the officers at the scene or prevent the destruction of evidence. Id. , at 5 , 162 P. 3d , at 644 . Accordingly , the court held that the search of Gants car was unreasonable .	The District constituting the seat of government of the United States shall appoint in such manner as the Congress may direct : A number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a state , but in no event more than the least populous state ; they shall be in addition to those appointed by the states , but they shall be considered , for the purposes of the election of President and Vice President , to be electors appointed by a state ; and they shall meet in the District and perform such duties as provided by the twelfth article of amendment .

The chorus that has called for us to revisit Belton includes courts , scholars , and Members of this Court who have questioned that decisions clarity and its fidelity to Fourth Amendment principles .

All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it become a law , be presented to the President of the United States ; if he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it . If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law .

Consistent with our precedent , our analysis begins , as it should in every case addressing the reasonableness of a warrantless search , with the basic rule that searches conducted outside the judicial process , without prior approval by judge or magistrate , are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendmentsubject only to a few specifically established and well - delineated exceptions. Katz v. United States , 389 U. S. 347 , 357 ( 1967 ) ( footnote omitted ) . Among the exceptions to the warrant requirement is a search incident to a lawful arrest . See Weeks v. United States , 232 U. S. 383 , 392 ( 1914 ) . The exception derives from interests in officer safety and evidence preservation that are typically implicated in arrest situations . See United States v. Robinson , 414 U. S. 218 , 230234 ( 1973 ) ; Chimel , 395 U. S. , at 763 .	The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . He shall hold his office during the term of four years , and , together with the Vice President , chosen for the same term , be elected , as follows : Each state shall appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress : but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States ; he may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices , and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses , or either of them , and in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and shall commission all the officers of the United States . The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .	0
Consistent with our precedent , our analysis begins , as it should in every case addressing the reasonableness of a warrantless search , with the basic rule that searches conducted outside the judicial process , without prior approval by judge or magistrate , are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendmentsubject only to a few specifically established and well - delineated exceptions. Katz v. United States , 389 U. S. 347 , 357 ( 1967 ) ( footnote omitted ) . Among the exceptions to the warrant requirement is a search incident to a lawful arrest . See Weeks v. United States , 232 U. S. 383 , 392 ( 1914 ) . The exception derives from interests in officer safety and evidence preservation that are typically implicated in arrest situations . See United States v. Robinson , 414 U. S. 218 , 230234 ( 1973 ) ; Chimel , 395 U. S. , at 763 .	No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice , and no person who has held the office of President , or acted as President , for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once . But this article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this article was proposed by the Congress , and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President , or acting as President , during the term within which this article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term . This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three - fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states by the Congress .	0

For several reasons , we reject the States argument . First , the State seriously undervalues the privacy interests at stake . Although we have recognized that a motorists privacy interest in his vehicle is less substantial than in his home , see New York v. Class , 475 U. S. 106 , 112113 ( 1986 ) , the former interest is nevertheless important and deserving of constitutional protection , see Knowles , 525 U. S. , at 117 . It is particularly significant that Belton searches authorize police officers to search not just the passenger compartment but every purse , briefcase , or other container within that space . A rule that gives police the power to conduct such a search whenever an individual is caught committing a traffic offense , when there is no basis for believing evidence of the offense might be found in the vehicle , creates a serious and recurring threat to the privacy of countless individuals . Indeed , the character of that threat implicates the central concern underlying the Fourth Amendmentthe concern about giving police officers unbridled discretion to rummage at will among a persons private effects . 5	All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives . The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states , and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature . No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty five years , and been seven years a citizen of the United States , and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen . Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union , according to their respective numbers , which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons , including those bound to service for a term of years , and excluding Indians not taxed , three fifths of all other Persons . The actual Enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States , and within every subsequent term of ten years , in such manner as they shall by law direct . The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand , but each state shall have at least one Representative ; and until such enumeration shall be made , the state of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three , Massachusetts eight , Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one , Connecticut five , New York six , New Jersey four , Pennsylvania eight , Delaware one , Maryland six , Virginia ten , North Carolina five , South Carolina five , and Georgia three . When vacancies happen in the Representation from any state , the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies . The House of Representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers ; and shall have the sole power of impeachment . The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state , chosen by the legislature thereof , for six years ; and each Senator shall have one vote . Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election , they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes . The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen by resignation , or otherwise , during the recess of the legislature of any state , the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature , which shall then fill such vacancies . No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years , and been nine years a citizen of the United States and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen . The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate , but shall have no vote , unless they be equally divided . The Senate shall choose their other officers , and also a President pro tempore , in the absence of the Vice President , or when he shall exercise the office of President of the United States . The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments . When sitting for that purpose , they shall be on oath or affirmation . When the President of the United States is tried , the Chief Justice shall preside : And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present . Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office , and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor , trust or profit under the United States : but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment , trial , judgment and punishment , according to law . The times , places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives , shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof ; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations , except as to the places of choosing Senators . The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year , and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December , unless they shall by law appoint a different day . Each House shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members , and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business ; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day , and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members , in such manner , and under such penalties as each House may provide . Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings , punish its members for disorderly behavior , and , with the concurrence of two thirds , expel a member . Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings , and from time to time publish the same , excepting such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy ; and the yeas and nays of the members of either House on any question shall , at the desire of one fifth of those present , be entered on the journal . Neither House , during the session of Congress , shall , without the consent of the other , adjourn for more than three days , nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting . The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services , to be ascertained by law , and paid out of the treasury of the United States . They shall in all cases , except treason , felony and breach of the peace , be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same ; and for any speech or debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other place . No Senator or Representative shall , during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time : and no person holding any office under the United States , shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office . All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it become a law , be presented to the President of the United States ; if he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it . If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law . But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays , and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively . If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall have been presented to him , the same shall be a law , in like manner as if he had signed it , unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return , in which case it shall not be a law . Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill . The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises , to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States ; but all duties , imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States ; To borrow money on the credit of the United States ; To regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several states , and with the Indian tribes ; To establish a uniform rule of naturalization , and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States ; To coin money , regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin , and fix the standard of weights and measures ; To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States ; To establish post offices and post roads ; To promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries ; To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court ; To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas , and offenses against the law of nations ; To declare war , grant letters of marque and reprisal , and make rules concerning captures on land and water ; To raise and support armies , but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years ; To provide and maintain a navy ; To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces ; To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union , suppress insurrections and repel invasions ; To provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining , the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , reserving to the states respectively , the appointment of the officers , and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress ; To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten miles square ) as may , by cession of particular states , and the acceptance of Congress , become the seat of the government of the United States , and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be , for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , dockyards , and other needful buildings ;-- And To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof . The migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit , shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight , but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation , not exceeding ten dollars for each person . The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended , unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it . No bill of attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed .

No money shall be drawn from the treasury , but in consequence of appropriations made by law ; and a regular statement and account of receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time . No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States : and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them , shall , without the consent of the Congress , accept of any present , emolument , office , or title , of any kind whatever , from any king , prince , or foreign state . No state shall enter into any treaty , alliance , or confederation ; grant letters of marque and reprisal ; coin money ; emit bills of credit ; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts ; pass any bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or law impairing the obligation of contracts , or grant any title of nobility .

Contrary to the States suggestion , a broad reading of Belton is also unnecessary to protect law enforcement safety and evidentiary interests . Under our view , Belton and Thornton permit an officer to conduct a vehicle search when an arrestee is within reaching distance of the vehicle or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest . Other established exceptions to the warrant requirement authorize a vehicle search under additional circumstances when safety or evidentiary concerns demand . For instance , Michigan v. Long , 463 U. S. 1032 ( 1983 ) , permits an officer to search a vehicles passenger compartment when he has reasonable suspicion that an individual , whether or not the arrestee , is dangerous and might access the vehicle to gain immediate control of weapons. Id. , at 1049 ( citing Terry v. Ohio , 392 U. S. 1 , 21 ( 1968 ) ) . If there is probable cause to believe a vehicle contains evidence of criminal activity , United States v. Ross , 456 U. S. 798 , 820821 ( 1982 ) , authorizes a search of any area of the vehicle in which the evidence might be found . Unlike the searches permitted by Justice Scalias opinion concurring in the judgment in Thornton , which we conclude today are reasonable for purposes of the Fourth Amendment , Ross allows searches for evidence relevant to offenses other than the offense of arrest , and the scope of the search authorized is broader . Finally , there may be still other circumstances in which safety or evidentiary interests would justify a search . Cf . Maryland v. Buie , 494 U. S. 325 , 334 ( 1990 ) ( holding that , incident to arrest , an officer may conduct a limited protective sweep of those areas of a house in which he reasonably suspects a dangerous person may be hiding ) .

Contrary to the States suggestion , a broad reading of Belton is also unnecessary to protect law enforcement safety and evidentiary interests . Under our view , Belton and Thornton permit an officer to conduct a vehicle search when an arrestee is within reaching distance of the vehicle or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest . Other established exceptions to the warrant requirement authorize a vehicle search under additional circumstances when safety or evidentiary concerns demand . For instance , Michigan v. Long , 463 U. S. 1032 ( 1983 ) , permits an officer to search a vehicles passenger compartment when he has reasonable suspicion that an individual , whether or not the arrestee , is dangerous and might access the vehicle to gain immediate control of weapons. Id. , at 1049 ( citing Terry v. Ohio , 392 U. S. 1 , 21 ( 1968 ) ) . If there is probable cause to believe a vehicle contains evidence of criminal activity , United States v. Ross , 456 U. S. 798 , 820821 ( 1982 ) , authorizes a search of any area of the vehicle in which the evidence might be found . Unlike the searches permitted by Justice Scalias opinion concurring in the judgment in Thornton , which we conclude today are reasonable for purposes of the Fourth Amendment , Ross allows searches for evidence relevant to offenses other than the offense of arrest , and the scope of the search authorized is broader . Finally , there may be still other circumstances in which safety or evidentiary interests would justify a search . Cf . Maryland v. Buie , 494 U. S. 325 , 334 ( 1990 ) ( holding that , incident to arrest , an officer may conduct a limited protective sweep of those areas of a house in which he reasonably suspects a dangerous person may be hiding ) .	In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .	0

These exceptions together ensure that officers may search a vehicle when genuine safety or evidentiary concerns encountered during the arrest of a vehicles recent occupant justify a search . Construing Belton broadly to allow vehicle searches incident to any arrest would serve no purpose except to provide a police entitlement , and it is anathema to the Fourth Amendment to permit a warrantless search on that basis . For these reasons , we are unpersuaded by the States arguments that a broad reading of Belton would meaningfully further law enforcement interests and justify a substantial intrusion on individuals privacy . 8	The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January , and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January , of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified ; and the terms of their successors shall then begin .

We do not agree with the contention in Justice Alitos dissent ( hereinafter dissent ) that consideration of police reliance interests requires a different result . Although it appears that the States reading of Belton has been widely taught in police academies and that law enforcement officers have relied on the rule in conducting vehicle searches during the past 28 years , 11 many of these searches were not justified by the reasons underlying the Chimel exception . Countless individuals guilty of nothing more serious than a traffic violation have had their constitutional right to the security of their private effects violated as a result . The fact that the law enforcement community may view the States version of the Belton rule as an entitlement does not establish the sort of reliance interest that could outweigh the countervailing interest that all individuals share in having their constitutional rights fully protected . If it is clear that a practice is unlawful , individuals interest in its discontinuance clearly outweighs any law enforcement entitlement to its persistence . Cf . Mincey v. Arizona , 437 U. S. 385 , 393 ( 1978 ) ( [T]he mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the Fourth Amendment ) . The dissents reference in this regard to the reliance interests cited in Dickerson v. United States , 530 U. S. 428 ( 2000 ) , is misplaced . See post , at 5 .

After Rodney Gant was arrested for driving with a suspended license , handcuffed , and locked in the back of a patrol car , police officers searched his car and discovered cocaine in the pocket of a jacket on the backseat . Because Gant could not have accessed his car to retrieve weapons or evidence at the time of the search , the Arizona Supreme Court held that the search - incident - to - arrest exception to the Fourth Amendments warrant requirement , as defined in Chimel v. California , 395 U. S. 752 ( 1969 ) , and applied to vehicle searches in New York v. Belton , 453 U. S. 454 ( 1981 ) , did not justify the search in this case . We agree with that conclusion .

All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills .

If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law .

If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall have been presented to him , the same shall be a law , in like manner as if he had signed it , unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return , in which case it shall not be a law . Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill .	0

Gant was charged with two offensespossession of a narcotic drug for sale and possession of drug paraphernalia ( i.e. , the plastic bag in which the cocaine was found ) . He moved to suppress the evidence seized from his car on the ground that the warrantless search violated the Fourth Amendment . Among other things , Gant argued that Belton did not authorize the search of his vehicle because he posed no threat to the officers after he was handcuffed in the patrol car and because he was arrested for a traffic offense for which no evidence could be found in his vehicle . When asked at the suppression hearing why the search was conducted , Officer Griffith responded : Because the law says we can do it. App . 75 .

The electors shall meet in their respective states , and vote by ballot for two persons , of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves . And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President , if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President . But in choosing the President , the votes shall be taken by States , the representation from each state having one vote ; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states , and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice . In every case , after the choice of the President , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President . But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes , the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President . The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors , and the day on which they shall give their votes ; which day shall be the same throughout the United States . No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States . In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President , and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation or inability , both of the President and Vice President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a President shall be elected . The President shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .

After protracted state - court proceedings , the Arizona Supreme Court concluded that the search of Gants car was unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment . The courts opinion discussed at length our decision in Belton , which held that police may search the passenger compartment of a vehicle and any containers therein as a contemporaneous incident of an arrest of the vehicles recent occupant . 216 Ariz. 1 , 34 , 162 P. 3d 640 , 642643 ( 2007 ) ( citing 453 U. S. , at 460 ) . The court distinguished Belton as a case concerning the permissible scope of a vehicle search incident to arrest and concluded that it did not answer the threshold question whether the police may conduct a search incident to arrest at all once the scene is secure. 216 Ariz. , at 4 , 162 P. 3d , at 643 . Relying on our earlier decision in Chimel , the court observed that the search - incident - to - arrest exception to the warrant requirement is justified by interests in officer safety and evidence preservation . 216 Ariz. , at 4 , 162 P. 3d , at 643 . When the justifications underlying Chimel no longer exist because the scene is secure and the arrestee is handcuffed , secured in the back of a patrol car , and under the supervision of an officer, the court concluded , a warrantless search of the arrestees car can not be justified as necessary to protect the officers at the scene or prevent the destruction of evidence. Id. , at 5 , 162 P. 3d , at 644 .

The chorus that has called for us to revisit Belton includes courts , scholars , and Members of this Court who have questioned that decisions clarity and its fidelity to Fourth Amendment principles .

In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation , the Vice President shall become President . Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President , the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress . Whenever the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office , and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary , such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President .

For several reasons , we reject the States argument . First , the State seriously undervalues the privacy interests at stake . Although we have recognized that a motorists privacy interest in his vehicle is less substantial than in his home , see New York v. Class , 475 U. S. 106 , 112113 ( 1986 ) , the former interest is nevertheless important and deserving of constitutional protection , see Knowles , 525 U. S. , at 117 . It is particularly significant that Belton searches authorize police officers to search not just the passenger compartment but every purse , briefcase , or other container within that space . A rule that gives police the power to conduct such a search whenever an individual is caught committing a traffic offense , when there is no basis for believing evidence of the offense might be found in the vehicle , creates a serious and recurring threat to the privacy of countless individuals . Indeed , the character of that threat implicates the central concern underlying the Fourth Amendmentthe concern about giving police officers unbridled discretion to rummage at will among a persons private effects . 5	The District constituting the seat of government of the United States shall appoint in such manner as the Congress may direct : A number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a state , but in no event more than the least populous state ; they shall be in addition to those appointed by the states , but they shall be considered , for the purposes of the election of President and Vice President , to be electors appointed by a state ; and they shall meet in the District and perform such duties as provided by the twelfth article of amendment .

Contrary to the States suggestion , a broad reading of Belton is also unnecessary to protect law enforcement safety and evidentiary interests . Under our view , Belton and Thornton permit an officer to conduct a vehicle search when an arrestee is within reaching distance of the vehicle or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest . Other established exceptions to the warrant requirement authorize a vehicle search under additional circumstances when safety or evidentiary concerns demand . For instance , Michigan v. Long , 463 U. S. 1032 ( 1983 ) , permits an officer to search a vehicles passenger compartment when he has reasonable suspicion that an individual , whether or not the arrestee , is dangerous and might access the vehicle to gain immediate control of weapons. Id. , at 1049 ( citing Terry v. Ohio , 392 U. S. 1 , 21 ( 1968 ) ) . If there is probable cause to believe a vehicle contains evidence of criminal activity , United States v. Ross , 456 U. S. 798 , 820821 ( 1982 ) , authorizes a search of any area of the vehicle in which the evidence might be found . Unlike the searches permitted by Justice Scalias opinion concurring in the judgment in Thornton , which we conclude today are reasonable for purposes of the Fourth Amendment , Ross allows searches for evidence relevant to offenses other than the offense of arrest , and the scope of the search authorized is broader . Finally , there may be still other circumstances in which safety or evidentiary interests would justify a search . Cf . Maryland v. Buie , 494 U. S. 325 , 334 ( 1990 ) ( holding that , incident to arrest , an officer may conduct a limited protective sweep of those areas of a house in which he reasonably suspects a dangerous person may be hiding ) .

These exceptions together ensure that officers may search a vehicle when genuine safety or evidentiary concerns encountered during the arrest of a vehicles recent occupant justify a search . Construing Belton broadly to allow vehicle searches incident to any arrest would serve no purpose except to provide a police entitlement , and it is anathema to the Fourth Amendment to permit a warrantless search on that basis . For these reasons , we are unpersuaded by the States arguments that a broad reading of Belton would meaningfully further law enforcement interests and justify a substantial intrusion on individuals privacy . 8	No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice , and no person who has held the office of President , or acted as President , for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once .

We do not agree with the contention in Justice Alitos dissent ( hereinafter dissent ) that consideration of police reliance interests requires a different result . Although it appears that the States reading of Belton has been widely taught in police academies and that law enforcement officers have relied on the rule in conducting vehicle searches during the past 28 years , 11 many of these searches were not justified by the reasons underlying the Chimel exception . Countless individuals guilty of nothing more serious than a traffic violation have had their constitutional right to the security of their private effects violated as a result . The fact that the law enforcement community may view the States version of the Belton rule as an entitlement does not establish the sort of reliance interest that could outweigh the countervailing interest that all individuals share in having their constitutional rights fully protected . If it is clear that a practice is unlawful , individuals interest in its discontinuance clearly outweighs any law enforcement entitlement to its persistence . Cf . Mincey v. Arizona , 437 U. S. 385 , 393 ( 1978 ) ( [T]he mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the Fourth Amendment ) . The dissents reference in this regard to the reliance interests cited in Dickerson v. United States , 530 U. S. 428 ( 2000 ) , is misplaced . See post , at 5 . In observing that Miranda has become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture, 530 U. S. , at 443 , the Court was referring not to policereliance on a rule requiring them to provide warnings but to the broader societal reliance on that individual right .

I agree with Justice Alito that New York v. Belton , 453 U. S. 454 ( 1981 ) , is best read as setting forth a bright - line rule that permits a warrantless search of the passenger compartment of an automobile incident to the lawful arrest of an occupantregardless of the danger the arrested individual in fact poses . I also agree with Justice Stevens , however , that the rule can produce results divorced from its underlying Fourth Amendment rationale . Compare Belton , supra , with Chimel v. California , 395 U. S. 752 , 764 ( 1969 ) ( explaining that the rule allowing contemporaneous searches is justified by the need to prevent harm to a police officer or destruction of evidence of the crime ) . For that reason I would look for a better rulewere the question before us one of first impression .

I agree with Justice Alito that New York v. Belton , 453 U. S. 454 ( 1981 ) , is best read as setting forth a bright - line rule that permits a warrantless search of the passenger compartment of an automobile incident to the lawful arrest of an occupantregardless of the danger the arrested individual in fact poses . I also agree with Justice Stevens , however , that the rule can produce results divorced from its underlying Fourth Amendment rationale . Compare Belton , supra , with Chimel v. California , 395 U. S. 752 , 764 ( 1969 ) ( explaining that the rule allowing contemporaneous searches is justified by the need to prevent harm to a police officer or destruction of evidence of the crime ) . For that reason I would look for a better rulewere the question before us one of first impression .	Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other state . And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts , records , and proceedings shall be proved , and the effect thereof .	0
